By the end of the year , there will be almost a billion people on a planet using social media sites .
The one thing everybody has in common is that they will die .
While this may be a little bit of a morbid thought , I think it has significant implications to explore .
Now what made me start thinking about this was a blog record written earlier this year by Derek Khaler , who was a science journalist and technology that died of cancer .
And what Miller did was he asked his family and his friends to write a post that came out a little bit after his patriarchy .
Here &apos;s what he wrote to start this .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead and this is my last poster in the blog .
Earlier , I asked that when my body finally turned off from my cancer punishment , so my family and my friends publishing the presumed message I wrote — the first step of the process of turning it from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while I was a journalist , Archive Miller might have written better and edited better than most , actually all of us today are creating an archive that is completely different than anything that was previously created by the previous generation .
Consider some statistics for a moment .
It &apos;s currently 48 hours of video per YouTube every minute .
There are 200 million Twitter messages written every day .
And the average Facebook user makes 90 pieces of content every month .
So when you think about your parents or your surroundings , at best they &apos;ve made some pictures or films , or a journal that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re creating this rich digital component that &apos;s going to live in the cloud forever , years after we die .
And I think it &apos;s going to create some very interesting opportunities for technology .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a non-tech journalist , so what I &apos;d like to briefly do is paint a picture of what the present and the future will look like .
Now we &apos;re already seeing some toilets designed to allow us to decide what will happen to our online profile and our media accounts after we die .
One of them actually , appropriately , found me when I walked into a diner in a restaurant in New York , in Porschwall .
( Audio ) Adam Austrio : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
EU : Yeah .
Death : Death can catch you everywhere , at any time , even in the organic .
AE : Who is that ?
Death : Go to iPaddie.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Austrio : Pretty frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
So what the service is doing , quite simply , is allowing you to create a message or a video that will be distributed to Facebook after your death .
Another service now is called 1,000 memories .
And what this allows you is to create online memo for your loved ones , with film images and stories that they can raise after your death .
But what I think will come next is much more interesting .
Now many of you probably know Dave Roy , March , showed how he can analyze over 90,000 hours of home video .
I think that as the machine capabilities to understand human language and process huge amounts of information continue to improve it will become possible to analyze entire life content of a person — the tweets , the photos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re making in such enormous quantities .
And I think when this happens , it will be possible for our digital personality to continue to communicate with the real world much after we are thanks to the enormous amount of information that we &apos;ve created and the ability of technology to understand it .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
In a service called my next twist looking at all your Twitter streams , everything you wrote on Twitter , to make some predictions of what we &apos;re going to write next .
So now , as you can see , the results can be quite localized .
You can imagine what that would look like in five , 10 , 20 years when our technological capabilities improve .
If we take this one step further , the MIT Media Lab works on robots that can communicate more like people .
But what if these robots were able to communicate on a basis of unique properties of a particular person based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of information that this person had created in his life ?
Finally , think of this famous scene from the West of 2008 election in the United States , where CNN broadcast a live hologram of artist Hype Hope Wille , if into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
What if we could use the same technology to launch a representation of our loved ones into our living room — and interact in a very realistic way based on all the content that they created while they were alive .
I think it will become completely possible when the amount of information we use and the technological ability to understand it will expand exponentially .
Now finally , I think what we all need to think about is whether we want to become our reality — and if so what that means to define life and everything that comes after that .
Thank you very much .

People who come back to work after a break in Creative — I call them remotivation .
They &apos;re very similar to others that experience beyond : military veterans , soldiers , people who have interpreted returns from retirement or people who come back from living abroad .
It &apos;s hard to go back to work after a break because there &apos;s a disconnect between employers and remotivation .
employers may think that recruiting people with &quot; &quot; hole &quot; &quot; in the lifetimes is a dangerous move , and people in a career break may question their ability to relaunch their career , especially if they haven &apos;t worked for a long time .
This disconnect is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Repower drives that have been successful everywhere and in every field .
This is Sami Kapala .
He &apos;s a British nuclear physicist who took five years of break to be at home with his five children .
The media in Singapore recently wrote about nurses coming back to work after long career break .
And if you talk about long breaks , this is Mimi Khan .
She &apos;s a social worker from Orange in California , who went back to work as a social worker after 25 years of break .
It &apos;s the longest career break I know .
The Supreme Court judge Sandra Di Okonor took five years of break early in her career .
And this is Tracey Peru , who took a 13-year break .
Tracey did what most of us do when we feel that we had a good day looking for work .
She was looking for a role in finance or accounting management , and she spent the last nine months looking at online companies , asking for work requests , but no results .
I met Tracey in June 2011 , when the program asked me to work with her to see if I could help her .
Watch that , and don &apos;t worry about it .
There will be a handful of suggestions that will eventually lead to employment opportunities . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you immediately what happened with Tracey , but I want to share with you a discovery that I discovered when I went back to work after a career break 11 years old .
And that , in other words , is your image frozen in time .
There &apos;s one thing , which I remember very clearly from my private career break .
I believe that remotivation is treasure to the workforce , and that &apos;s why .
We &apos;ve done that already .
We have fewer partner dancing .
We &apos;re more inhabited in life .
We have a beauty of working experience .
We have an older perspective .
We &apos;re not looking for ourselves at the cost of employment .
And we also have energy , and we &apos;ve been excited to go back to work because we &apos;ve gotten rid of it for a period .
On the other side , I talk to employers and here are two concerns that employers have about remotivation .
The first is , employers worry that remotivation will not be technological update .
My financial report I wrote so long , I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
I don &apos;t even know if someone remembers so far , but I had to relearn it on Excel .
It was actually not that hard , a lot of commands are the same .
I say to all the remotivations that employers expect them to come to the office with practical knowledge in Office .
And if they &apos;re not updated , it &apos;s their responsibility to update .
And they do it .
This is the responsibility of the repetitive workers to show the employer where they can contribute the most .
In 2010 , I noticed something .
I saw an engineer coming back , an untypical repetitive candidate , serving candidates to specialize in the military , and then you get a fixed job there .
Think about how much we moved forward .
Before that , most employers were not interested in working with remotivation .
A different pool , the same idea .
So I &apos;m going to tell you what happened to Tracy Peru .
Fast forward to 2015 , previous tricks .
They funded her to graduate school for MBA .
She even hired another remotivation to work for her .
Now , my goal is to bring the idea of specialization back to work more and more employers .

Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar technology industry .
And my little bank company is interested in imposing ourselves on the environment by requiring attention ...
Heart attention to mass planning .
It &apos;s just a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
Ha . Wait a minute .
It &apos;s going to take a moment to go up .
( Laughter ) Well maybe — we can just jump — I &apos;ll just skip the video ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) It &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The solar technology is ...
Am I out of time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .

This was the afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I worked at the American Civil Rights Association as the National Science Council of the organization .
I really , I really loved my job , but I had one of these days where I felt a little bit frustrated .
So I went down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
Chris was at ACLU for over 30 years , so he had knowledge and deep institutional insights .
I explained to Chris that I feel a little stuck .
I &apos;ve been studying a number of issues in the intersection between science and civil rights — super interesting .
But I wanted the ACLU to work on these issues in a much broader way , in a way that can really make a difference .
So Chris cut straight and interesting , and he said , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;re looking at , what are the first five ? &quot;
Oh , and of course , there are patents on genes . &quot; &quot; Garden patents ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You tell me that the United States government has patented patents on part of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be true . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came in a storm for my office .
&quot; Oh my God ! Are you right ! Who can we prosecute ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Chris is a brilliant lawyer , but he almost knew nothing about patent laws and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , certainly not a patent lawyer .
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could make a lawsuit .
First of all , we had to figure out exactly what a patent registration was when someone wrote a patent garden .
Petents on genes usually contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial variations are the ones called isolated DNA — that is , some of the DNA that &apos;s separated from the cell .
And the patents weren &apos;t just a particular gene that they were isolated , but on every possible version of this gene .
So what does that mean ?
That means you can &apos;t give your gene to the doctor and ask it or her to look at it , for example , see if it has any mutations , without the permission of the patent holder .
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using this gene in research or clinical trials .
To enable patent holders , often private companies , to lock parts of the human genome damaged patients .
Think of an ambiguity , 10 years old with a long QT syndrome , a severe heart condition , that if not a patient , can end up with sudden death .
The company that held the patent on two genes linked to the situation developed a test to diagnose the syndrome .
But then they spread a leg and they never offered it .
So another lab was trying to propose the test , but the company that kept patents threatened to sue the lab on patent violation .
So as a result , for two years , no test was available .
Garden patents make a problem clearly and hurt patients .
But is there a way we can read about them to challenge ?
It turns out that the Supreme Court has declared a long series of cases , that some things don &apos;t deserve to be registered as a patent .
You can &apos;t patent the products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t patent the laws of nature — the laws of gravity , E = mc2 .
These things are just too basic and you have to stay free for all and not be reserved for anyone .
We think that DNA , the basic structure of life , that encodes to make all of our proteins , is also the product of nature and also the law of nature , no matter whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting at the bottom of a distinction .
When we focused on this , we traveled across the country to talk to many different specialists — scientists , medical people , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we were right in terms of policy , and at least in theory , in terms of law .
Why is that ?
So , the patent office has registered these patents for over 20 years .
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
The patent committee was deep inside the status quo , the biotechnology industry grew around this issue , and legislation to ban patents on genes was shown year after year in Congress , and went nowhere .
So the bottom line : courts just won &apos;t be willing to drop those patents .
Now , not Chris and I weren &apos;t the kind of climb that got rid of a challenge , and to hear , &quot; &quot; Being right is just not enough , &quot; &quot; seems like another reason to fight this battle .
So we had to build our bag .
Now , patent cases tend to be : A company A sums up a company B on some small , insignificant technical issue .
So we decided that we were going to develop a case that wasn &apos;t like the typical patent cases — more like a civil rights case .
We had to identify a patent patent of a gene that imposed his patents in shrunk and then organize a wide coalition of prosecutors and experts who could tell the court about all the ways that these patents hurt patients and innovations .
We found the main candidate for the lawsuit at Myrad Jennx , a company located in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Myriad held patents on two genes , the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 .
Women with certain mutations throughout these genes are considered a significant risk of developing breast cancer and disease .
Myriad used these patents to maintain a complete monopoly on the BRCA test in the United States .
They forced many labs to propose a BRCA test to stop .
The company raised a lot of money on the test — over 3,000 dollars .
They stopped sharing their clinical data with the international scientific community .
And perhaps the worst of all , for a few years period , Miriad refused to update their test to include additional mutations identified by a team of researchers in France .
It was estimated that during this period , for a few years , up to 12 percent of the women who passed the test got a wrong answer — a negative test result that had to be positive .
This is Celine McCain .
Celine &apos;s sister , Eileen , developed breast cancer at 40 years old and was tested by Myriad .
The test was negative .
The family felt relief .
That means that Eileen &apos;s cancer probably didn &apos;t pass through the family , and the other family members didn &apos;t have to be tested .
But two years later , Celine was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer .
If Eileen had received the result of correction , Celine would have been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have avoided .
Once we decided about Miriad , then we had to create a coalition of prosecutors and experts that could illuminate these problems .
We ended up with 20 very committed prosecutors : genetic consultants , geneticists who got contraceptives , cigarettes , four large scientific organizations that would collectively represent more than 150,000 scientists and professional medical professionals , and private women who couldn &apos;t afford Miriad &apos;s test , or wanted to get a second division and couldn &apos;t , as a result of the patents .
One of the great challenges that we had in preparing the case was to figure out what the better shape to get science through .
So in order to argue that what Mariad did was not an invention , and that isolated genes of BRCA were natural products , we had to explain two basic concepts , like : What is a gene ? What is DNA ?
How do you isolate DNA ? And why isn &apos;t it an invention ?
We spent hours and hours with our professionals and experts , trying to find ways to explain these concepts simply but exactly .
And we ended up honestly relieving the use of metaphor , like gold .
So isolating DNA — it &apos;s like a gold pack fast or its spending from a stream .
You might patent the process of gold mining , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
It may have taken a lot of hard work and an effort to dig and get the gold out of the mountain ; you can &apos;t yet write the patent , it &apos;s still gold .
So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to make our lawsuit .
We submitted the Federal Court in the southern province of New York , and the exact case was randomly summarized to Judge Robert Swart .
In March 2010 , the judge Swart published his opinion — 152 pages — and a total victory to our side .
In knowing , we couldn &apos;t overcome what furniture he described science in this lawsuit .
I mean , our harvest — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this thing in such a short period of time ?
We just couldn &apos;t figure out how it happened .
So it turns out , the role of the judge Savitt who worked for him at the time , was not just a lawyer — he was a scientist .
He wasn &apos;t just a scientist — he had a Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What an amazing fortune mine !
Miriad then woke up to the US federal Cities Court .
And this is where things really get interesting .
First of all , at a very crucial moment in the case , the U.S. government switched aside .
So in the district court , the government had a legal harvest on the side of Myriad .
But now , in contrast to its patent office , the U.S. government has taken a harvest that suggests that the government has reexamined this with the opinion of the district court , and it &apos;s come to the conclusion that isolated DNA is not registered as a patent .
It was really a big deal , totally unexpected .
The Federal Civil Court hears all patent cases , and it has a reputation of being very , very much for patents .
So even with this extraordinary development , we expected to lose .
And we lost .
About .
The final decision was split , two to one .
But the two judges that stopped us , did it for completely different reasons .
The first , the judge Leurry , built himself a original biological theory — completely wrong .
( Laughter ) He decided that Mariad created a new chemical — completely irrational .
Myriad didn &apos;t even get it wrong , so it was very surprising .
The second , the judge Moore , said that she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
But she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to take the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; Third , the judge Brillison , agreed with us .
So now we &apos;ve been looking for a review by the Supreme Court .
And when you go to the Supreme Court , you have to present a question that you want the court to answer .
Usually these questions perceive a form of super-long paragraph , something like a whole page with a lot of very paragraph , &quot; &quot; What a testing &quot; &quot; here and &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; there .
We may have approached the shortest question ever asked .
Four words : human genes are patented ?
I want judges to have exactly the same response that I had when you put this thing up in front of me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with it .
The Supreme Court only hears one percent of all the lawsuits he gets , and he agreed to hear our own .
Two organizations of breast cancer , breast cancer Action and FORCE , organized protests on the court rate .
Chris and I sat still in the hallway , moments before he was supposed to go in and claim the most important argument in his career .
I was clearly more nervous than him .
The argument itself was fascinating .
Chris argued brilliantly .
The judge Kagan compared an isolated DNA to take a healing plant from the Amazon .
The Justice Roberts made it bigger than a western baseball champion .
And in one of my very favorite moments , the judge Sotomer declared that DNA isolated is &quot; &quot; Just nature sits there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident ourselves when we left the court hall that day , but I would never have predicted the result : nine versus zero .
&quot; &quot; A piece of DNA that naturally appears is a product of nature , and you can &apos;t patent it just because it &apos;s lonely .
More importantly , Miriad did nothing . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five labs announced that they would start proposing testing for the BRCA gene .
Some of them promised to propose the test at a lower cost than Mariad .
Some promised to provide a more inclusive test than the one that Mariad suggests .
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myrad .
It ends up driving 25 years of allowing patent registration of human genes in the United States .
It downloads a significant obstacle to discovery and invention in biomedical .
And it helps to ensure patients like Abidabar , Celine and Eileen will have access to the tests they need .
Number three weeks after the court published his decision , I got a little package in the mail .
She was a Cock-Diagan , a professor at Duke University and one of the first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to take this bag .
I opened it up to see a little animal doll .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk when we took this bag .
Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was that we knew we were doing the right thing .
It took almost eight years from the beginning to the end , with a lot of different facilities and changes along the way .
A little lucky enough helped , but these were the communities that we sang between , the alliances that we created , that allowed pigs to fly .
Thank you .

The second quote is the mouth of a head .
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
And then you can make predictions and test them .
What do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts .
Where are the economic networks ?
What we &apos;ve been looking at in detail is ownership networks .
And we also harvest value to every society .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
It &apos;s companies that work more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
Let me explain with the following example .
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you to the snippets of about eight of my projects , collaborated with the Danish artist Soran Force .
We call ourselves Portus and Shoots , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , called &quot; &quot; The David phone . &quot; &quot; And the inspiration for him came from my uncle &apos;s strange foot to ask me without a break to do things for him , almost as if I was a sequel of his body — turn on the lights or bring him a glass of water , a cigarette box .
And as I grew up , it got worse and worse , and I started thinking about it as a kind of control .
But of course , I could never have said anything , because David is a dignified figure in the Indian family .
And the situation that stopped me and amazed me most was his use on a linear phone .
He would hold the tube and expect me to celebrate the number for him .
So in response and preparation for my uncle , I created &quot; &quot; The David phone . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s so long that he takes two people to use .
That &apos;s exactly how my uncle uses a phone designed for one person .
But the problem is , when I left the house and went to college , I started to miss his commands .
So I created a lovely writing machine through which it can divide its functions into nephews and nephews around the world as an email .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the machine , print the email or the command and and pull the paper out .
This device would automatically send the person to document the letter as an email .
So here you can see , we &apos;ve embedded a lot of electronics that understand all the mechanical actions and convert them into digital .
So my uncle is just dealing with a mechanical interface .
And of course , the object had to be very big and have a sense of rituals , the way my uncle likes it .
The next job is a sensitive installation to a voice that we call in the &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; The Garden &quot; &quot; ) And we wanted to work with an idea of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So how it works is that we have these panels , that we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures that hide .
Once there &apos;s silence , they kind of crawl out .
And if it &apos;s even more quiet , they stretch their necks out .
And to hear the smallest voice , they hide again .
So we had these panels on three walls in the room .
And we had over 500 of these little scaffolds hiding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a prototype movie .
So when silence , they kind of come out behind the panels .
And they hear like people hear , or like real creatures .
So they become immune to sound that scare them after a while .
And they don &apos;t respond to background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in a moment that they don &apos;t respond to .
( Noise ) But they react to sound in the front , you &apos;ll hear it in a second .
( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as alive as possible .
So every pigma has its behavior , psychology , mood , personality and so on .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it gets much better afterwards .
And we made them respond to people , but we found that people were very amateur and friendly with them .
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Unprecedented Man . &quot; &quot; And we were kind of interested in playing with the idea of invisible .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisible ?
So we worked with a company that specializes in surveillance with cameras , and we asked them to develop software with us , using a camera that can look at people in the room , follow them and replace one person with the background , making them invisible .
So I &apos;ll just show you a first prototype .
On the right-hand side you can see my colleague Soran , who &apos;s actually in space .
And on the left , you see the working video where the camera made it invisible .
Surn goes into the room . Pop ! He becomes invisible .
And you can see the camera is following him and playing .
This is a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet treated overlap and all of this , but it &apos;s been pretty fast , later .
So the way we used this was in a room where we had a camera looking in space , and we had one screen , one for each wall .
And when people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the screen , only with one difference : one person was constantly invisible everywhere they moved into the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; Sunshine Sdow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a paper sheet , like a cut of painting kids of oil spill or sunlight .
And from the front , the object looks very strong and resilient , and on the side , it almost looks very weak .
So people would go into the room and they would almost ignore it , think it &apos;s just garbage lying there .
But once they were going through it , it would start climbing on the wall in a prosthetic motion .
And it would get tired , and it would collapse every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a cartoon of a reverse person .
His head is so heavy . It &apos;s filled with heavy thoughts , which is kind of falling into his hat , and his body is grown from it almost like a plant .
Well what it does is it moves around in a very , very well-known way on its head in a very unpredictable and very slow motion .
And it &apos;s pretty limited by that circle .
Because if the circle wasn &apos;t there , and the floor was really straight , it would start spinning in space .
And there are no wires .
So I &apos;ll just show you a case — so when people go into the room , it activates this object .
And it &apos;s very slow , for a few minutes , sort of lifts slowly , and then it gets a momentum and it looks like it almost falls .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to make the viewer instinct almost go and help , or save the object .
But he doesn &apos;t really need it , because he , again , kind of manages to lift himself up .
So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our work , for years to do the mechanics right and the equilibrium and dynamics .
And it was very important for us to find the exact moment where it would fall , because if we did it in a way that it would fall , then it would hurt itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t cause that capitalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a quick video where we do tests — it &apos;s much faster .
This is my colleague . He left it .
Now he &apos;s stressed , so he &apos;s going to catch him .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because he &apos;s able to raise himself .
So this is a work that &apos;s very interested in us , working with the aesthetics of the fur that are embedded in thousands of different types of optical fibers , which are shrunk like the night sky .
And this is on the scale of the night sky .
So we wrapped up with this a balloon form , in the form of a bee , which handed out of the ceiling .
And the idea was to give a kind of contrast to something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of the bears , which is very reassuring and intimate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of the bears and you would almost pick it up as a hole in space , and as if you look at the stars &apos; sky .
So this is the last job , and it &apos;s still at work , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Water . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a little cube about this size standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and when you approach it , it &apos;s trying to scare you by growing a double cube at four times the volume .
So this object is expanding and contracting without a break to create an international dynamics between the people around it — almost as if it &apos;s trying to hide a secret within the suburbs or something like that .
So we &apos;re working with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really like technology , because it makes us a lot of pain at work over the years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in how it can help us express the emotions and behaviors in these creatures that we create .
And once a creature jumps in our heads , it &apos;s almost as if the creative process is to discover the way that this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to wear and what way it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m very happy to be here .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , because it &apos;s going to be a little weird . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And in &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
It &apos;s here .
I mean Earth .
And in &quot; &quot; us , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us who are in Auditorium , but for life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from one-celled composites , from crystals and mushrooms and flying bears . ( Laughter )
The interesting thing is that Earth is the only place that we know has life — 8.7 million species .
We were looking elsewhere , maybe not as well as we needed or could , but we were looking and we didn &apos;t find at all ; the Earth is the only place we know with life .
Is Earth special ?
It turns out , for all 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
On the one hand , all life on Earth needs energy .
On the other hand , all life needs food or nutrition .
And it looks like a confined request , especially if you want a prosperity in a conservative .
So it leaves the thing in the middle as the high column , the hardest thing to get .
Not Aile , but water .
( Laughter ) Even though an email could be pretty cool . ( Laughter )
And not frozen water , not water in a gas situation , but liquid water .
That &apos;s what life needs to survive , any form of life .
And many bodies in the solar system have no liquid water , so we &apos;re not looking for it .
Other bodies in the solar system can be liquid water in abundance , even more than Earth , but they &apos;re trapped under ice layer , so the approach to them is difficult , difficult to reach them , it &apos;s hard to even find out if there &apos;s life there .
So it leaves a number of bodies that we need to take into account .
So let &apos;s simplify the problem for ourselves .
Let &apos;s just think about liquid water on the surface of the planet .
You have to have an atmosphere so that the water will be liquid .
You have to be very careful with this atmosphere .
But if there &apos;s too much atmosphere , and it &apos;s too thin or too cold , the star becomes like Mars , too cold .
So too hot Venus , Mars is too cold , and the Earth is just like it should .
However , I &apos;d like to remind you two things from the story of love , which may not be thinking about much , but I think they &apos;re very relevant here .
Number one : If the bowl of Mother Duba is too cold when love comes into the room , does it mean she was always too cold ?
Or could it have been at some other temperature ?
And that &apos;s true of planets as well .
They &apos;re not static things . They &apos;re changing .
They &apos;re diverse . They develop .
And atmospheres behave similarly .
Let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
And it can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as liquid .
This one image tells you that the Mars atmosphere has changed , and it has changed enormously .
And it changed from a situation that we were properly defined as living , because the three requirements for life existed long ago .
Where is this atmosphere that allowed water to be liquid on the surface ?
One hypothesis is that it escaped out into space .
Atmospheric particles got enough energy to unleash the gravity force of the planet , escaped out into space , and never came back .
And this happens with every atmospheric body .
It &apos;s just a matter of scale and scale .
So we &apos;d like to figure out how much smells over time so that we could explain this change .
How do atmospheres get their energy for escape ?
How do particles get enough energy to escape ?
A light that escapes from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and heat up the particles .
Yes , I dance , but they — ( Laughter ) God forbid , not even in my wedding . ( Laughter )
They get enough energy to escape and unleash the gravity force of the planet by warming alone .
Another way they can get energy is solar power .
And of course , the distance of a planet from the Sun determines its temperature .
It has to be about a habitable environment .
But maybe there are other things that we need to take into account .
The Earth has this field ; Venus and Mars don &apos;t .
Magnetic fields form in the deep internal part of a planet by electric walking of a spinning liquid material that creates a giant magnetic field surrounding the Earth .
If you have a compass , you know what direction the North is .
Venus and Mars don &apos;t have that .
( Laughter ) Does it affect a habitable environment ?
Well , how could that affect ?
Many scientists think that a planet magnetic field is used as a protective for the atmosphere , deflect solar particles around the planet a little bit like an impact of a power field associated with an electrical charge of these particles .
I &apos;m imagining it to update salad for planets to protect against the crashes .
So the impact , then , is that the Earth may have been protected for billions of years , because we had a magnetic field .
The atmosphere couldn &apos;t escape .
Mars , on the other hand , wasn &apos;t protected because it didn &apos;t have a magnetic field , and for billions of years , maybe enough atmospheres had spread from it to make a habitable transition to life to a planet that we see today .
Other scientists think magnetic fields might behave like a boat sail , allowing the planet to be more influenced by the energy of the solar wind than it could be influenced by not these fields .
The sails can gather energy from the solar wind .
The magnetic field can gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
If you &apos;ve ever experienced it , it &apos;s amazing .
We know the energy is coming in .
We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles go out and if the magnetic field impacts it in some way .
So I &apos;ve presented a problem here for you , but I don &apos;t have a solution yet .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How do we work on it ?
Well , we sent spacecraft to all three planets .
It &apos;s designed to measure atmospheric escape .
We have similar measurements from Venus and from Earth .
And we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for a habitable environment or not .
Once we have that answer , why would you care ?
And it &apos;s also , but it &apos;s deep .
But more than that , what we &apos;re going to learn from these planets could be applied on atmospheres everywhere , including planets that we &apos;re now watching around other stars .
Within the 20 years , we &apos;ve gone from knowing about zero planets outside of our solar system , to know about so much , that we don &apos;t know which ones to explore before .
Every direction will help .
In fact , based on observations that Kepler took and other similar observations , we now believe that of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy , on average , each planet has one planet at least .
In addition , we estimate that between 40 and 100 billion of these planets will be defined as living , just in our own galaxy .
You can &apos;t do it . You can &apos;t go there , still not .
Ultimately , and meanwhile at least , this is our red dot , right here .
It &apos;s the only planet that we know is worthy of life , although very soon we might argue about more .
But meanwhile , it &apos;s the only planet worth living , and that &apos;s our red dot .
I &apos;m very happy that we are here .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
Really .
Think about all the things that we got at the time .
Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the businesses , all the trade .
And this happens in our lifetime .
I &apos;m sure one day write history books hundreds of years from now . Our time , our generation will remember a ball that has become online , the generation that has built something truly global .
And yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , severe problems , security problems , privacy problems .
I dedicated my career to fighting these problems .
Let me show you something .
Here I hold Brain .
This is a Calypton 5.25 infected with the Brain.A. virus .
This is the first virus found for PC computers .
And we even know where Brain came from .
We know because he told us in the code .
Let &apos;s look together .
All right .
This is the reboot sector of contagious Calypton , and if you look deep in , it seems that right in this place , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the baby . &quot; &quot; And it goes on , 1986 , Bazeitt and Amgdam .
BZeitt and Amjaad are private names , Pakistani names .
In fact , there &apos;s also a phone number written in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) This is 1986 .
Today we are in 2011 .
It &apos;s 25 years .
The PC virus problem is 25 years old .
Half a year ago , I went to Pakistan myself .
And here are some pictures I took in Pakistan .
This is from the city of Lahore , which is 300 miles south of the Abobattabad where Bin Laden is caught .
This is a typical street .
And here &apos;s the street and the leading way to this building , through the 730 march of Alma Ikel .
And I hold the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
BZeitt and Emmjad , still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And yes , here is Bazite .
This is his brother Emmed .
They are the people who wrote the first PC virus .
Of course , we had an interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they felt about what they started .
And I had some satisfaction when I heard that both of them were attacked and infected tens of times unrelated viruses over the years .
And so there &apos;s some justice in the world after all .
The viruses that we were used to see in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s were no longer a problem .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what they looked like then .
I &apos;m running a system here that allows me to run very old software on a modern computer .
I &apos;m going to make some drives . I &apos;m going to go there .
Here we have a list of old viruses .
I &apos;m going to run some of them on the computer .
For example , let &apos;s start with the Centipede virus .
You can see on the screen up , there &apos;s a lot of legs running on the screen when you get infected with the virus .
You know you &apos;ve been infected , because it shows up .
Here &apos;s another one , a virus called Crash that was created in Russia in 1992 .
Now one that also makes noise .
( Sirana noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker does .
Yes , a guy walks to you on the screen as you get infected .
Well , it used to be easy to know that you were infected with the virus , when the virus was written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , they &apos;re no longer written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What you see here in the background is an example of one of the systems that we run in the lab , that we follow the world &apos;s friendships .
We can see in real time that we stopped viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if I connect back to the computer in the lab through the network , we can see in real time taste from the number of viruses , some new examples of malware that we find every day .
Here &apos;s the last virus that we found in a file called Surve.ex.
And we found it here three seconds ago . One in front of him , six seconds ago .
And if we dive down , the data is huge .
We find dozens and maybe even hundreds of thousands .
And this is from the last 20 minutes every day .
So where does all this come from ?
Well today , these are organized crime gangs that write the viruses because they make money out of it .
Changes like , let &apos;s go to Gangstas-UkS.com .
This is a website that &apos;s activated from a mix of people who buy computers that are infected with viruses .
If you write viruses and you can stick Windows computers , and you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell these computers — other people &apos;s computers — to these guys .
And they will really pay you money for the computers .
Well how do these guys earn money from the infected computers ?
There are a number of ways , like Trojan banking , that will steal money from your bank account when you do actions on the bank site , or the bow registration .
The rainbow , hidden from the display , is on the computer and record every note recorded in the keyboard .
You &apos;re sitting in front of the computer looking for things in Google .
Your search for Google is kept and sent to criminals .
Every email you write is preserved and sent to criminals .
Also every password you type in , etc .
But what they &apos;re most searching for is online trends acquire online online stores .
Because when you buy the Internet , you type in the name , the reporter for delivery , the number of credit card and security code .
And here &apos;s an example of a file that we found in the service a few weeks ago .
This is the credit card number , this is his attacker , this is the safety code , and this is the name of a card owner .
When you get access to those details , you can order what you want on their name .
And this is , of course , a problem .
We now have a competitive and business acousticia built around online crime .
One example of how these guys are able to earn money from their operations , we go and look at the pages of the Internet and look for people who are tough .
We &apos;re going to find people like Byrne Sandeen , instead of Sweden , and his crime partner , also registered by the hazard pages of the Interval , Mr. , who , Mr. Jane , the U.S. citizen .
They ran a operation called I.M. U , a crime operation using a computer that earned millions .
They &apos;re both at the very moment .
Nobody knows where they are .
The roles in the United States a few weeks ago , set up a bank account in Switzerland belonging to Mr. . Jane , into account that bank was 14.9 million dollars .
And so the amount of money that crime online produces is significant .
And that means that these criminals can invest money in attacks .
We know that these criminals recruit programmers , testing people , checking the code , they have management systems and databases .
And they can afford to test how we work , how security people work , and try to get us around and the defense systems that we build .
They also use the global nature of the Internet for their benefit .
I mean , the Internet is international .
So it &apos;s called the Internet .
And if you go and look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video from Clarraied Networks , showing how one harmful is moving around the world .
This process , we think that the beginning of Estonia , goes from country to country once they tried to turn off the site .
You can &apos;t turn them off .
They will move from country to country , from one jurisdiction to another , all over the world . They use our fact to coordinate these global policing actions .
And so the Internet is virtual to where there will be free flight cards for all the world &apos;s cybercriminals .
Now , the offenders who couldn &apos;t get to us before they got to us now .
So how do you actually find criminals online ?
How do you hunt them ?
I &apos;ll give you an example .
We have a shadow file here .
Here I &apos;m looking at the causal information of a picture file , which includes malicious code .
And that means that if you try to open the picture on a Windows computer , the malicious code will take over your computer and run a code .
Now if we look at the picture file , here &apos;s the occurrence of the picture , and here &apos;s the code of the attack starts .
And this code is encrypted , let &apos;s decipher it .
It was encrypted with the XOR 97 function .
Just believe me , like this , like this .
And we can go here and just like that to decipher it .
The yellow part of the code is now decoded .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t look so different from the source .
But keep staring at it .
Notice that down here there &apos;s an Internet address : Nionse-ek.com / ido-exe , and when you watch the picture on the computer it will go to this address , download and run the software .
And this is a backdoor to take over a computer .
But even more interesting , if we continue to decipher , we will find the next mysterious text that says O60000KO787 .
This code is under encryption as a kind of signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I looked at the code , and I tried to figure out what it meant .
Of course I discovered it .
I got zero results . He wasn &apos;t there .
So I talked to folks in the lab .
And we have some Russian folks in the lab , and one of them reminded , it ends up in a nice RNA , like Russia .
And 78 is the city code St. Petersburg .
For example , you can find it in phone numbers and license plates and so on .
So I looked for contact people at St. Petersburg , and after a long way , we ended up finding one particular website .
Here &apos;s the Russian guy who runs the site for years running his own website , and he writes a blog under Live Journalist Fuller .
And in a blog , he writes about his life , and his life in St. Petersburg . He &apos;s in the early 20s , writing about his cat , about his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a very nice car .
In fact , this guy is driving at Marcedes S600 and 12 engine 6.0 liters with over 400 horsepower .
Now , this is a very nice car for a 20-year-old kid and something at St. Petersburg .
How do I know about the car ?
Because he also writes about her on the blog .
He had an accident .
At the center of the city , Santa Patterborg , he goes in with the car in another car .
And he put some images out of the accident in the blog . This is his matrix , here &apos;s the car , Lada Samara , who he walked in .
And you can see the Samara license plate ends up in 787 .
And if you look at the whole picture , you can see that the Director &apos;s license plate is O6000000887 .
Now , I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I was , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve finished my argument . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when you grab computer criminals ?
The truth — it doesn &apos;t usually get there .
In most absolute majority of criminal cases online , we don &apos;t even know what the continent came from .
Even if we could find them , there &apos;s often no outcome .
The local police don &apos;t work , and if you do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for other reasons you can &apos;t drop them down .
I would love if it was easier , unfortunately it wasn &apos;t .
But things are changing at a very rapid rate .
You &apos;ve all heard of Stuxnet .
If you look at what Stuxnet did , she pasted like this .
This is S7-400 PLC , programmable logic controller .
And that &apos;s what drives our infrastructure .
That &apos;s what runs everything around us .
PLC , these little boxes without a display , no keyboard , programmed , put in action and do the work .
For example , the elevators in this building are probably dominated by these .
And Stoxnet infects one of these , it &apos;s a huge revolution in the dangers that we face .
Because everything around us is controlled by these .
I &apos;m talking about critical infrastructure .
Surrors , power stations , chemical factories , factories for food , look around — all run by computers .
Everything is run by computers .
It all depends on the working computers .
We &apos;ve become dependent on the Internet , depending on basic things like electricity , on working computers .
And this is a big thing that creates new problems for us .
We have to create a way to keep working even though computers stopped .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The point of honesty is that we can do things about even though the things we took for granted are not there .
These are basic things , thinking about continuity , about revelations , thinking about the relevant things .
I told you , ( Laughter ) I love the Internet , really .
Think about all the services we have online .
Think about a situation that takes them to you , one day you don &apos;t have them for one reason or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I worry that we might not get to see it .
I worry that we face problems because of online crimes .
Online crime is the thing that can take all this future from us .
( Laughter ) All of my life I protect the web , and I feel that if we don &apos;t fight online flu , we take a risk of losing everything .
We have to do it globally , and we have to do it now .
What we need is a global , international enforcement system for finding this crime , these organized gangs that earn millions of attacks .
It &apos;s much more important than the running of anti-virus or a firewall .
What &apos;s really important is to find the people behind the attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are going to become part of the crime world of tomorrow and are still not there .
We have to find the people with the capabilities , but without the opportunities , we have the opportunity to use their capabilities for the greater good .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing at extraordinary speed .
If you look at the diagram that &apos;s up here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , Goldman Sachs projections that before you suggests that the Chinese economy will be almost the same as the size of the American economy .
And if you look at the diagram for 2050 , the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American community , and the Indian economy , will be almost the size of the American economy .
And we need to remember at this point , that these predictions were created before the crisis in the Western economy .
Two weeks ago , I was interviewing the last projections published by BNP Paribas trying to predict when China &apos;s economy was going to go by the size of the American economy .
Goldman Sachs expect this to happen in 2027 .
The updated predictions after the crisis expect this to happen in 2020 .
It &apos;s just a decade from now .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental ways .
First , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , who have not stopped growing in the last 30 years , about 10 percent every year .
And within a decade , China will have the largest economy in the world .
Never in the history of modern age has happened , that the largest economy in the world will be this kind of developing country , not of a developed country .
Secondly , for the first time in modern age , the dominant country in the world that I think China will be , will not be a Western country and will have different cultural roots for reputation .
I know this is a welfare society in the West that when countries become more modern , they also become more Western .
This is an illusion .
There &apos;s a assumption that progress is a direct result of competition , free market and technology .
Well , it &apos;s not ; progress is equally shaped by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will not become Western .
China will remain , in the most fundamental ways , very different .
So the big question is clear , how do we understand China ?
How do we try to understand what China is ?
And the crazy problem that &apos;s going on right now in the West , is that traditional approach allows us to understand in Western terms and using Western ideas .
This is a contradiction by definition .
I want to offer you three building blocks that will help us try to understand what China is just as a starting point .
Let &apos;s start with the fact that China is not really a nation-state .
So yes , she &apos;s been calling herself a nation-state for a hundred years , but anyone who knows one or two about China knows that this is an old story from that .
This is what China &apos;s borders looked like after the victory of the Chapin &apos; 221 B.C. , at the end of the warrior states — the birth of modern China .
And you can see it against the borders of contemporary China .
Or right next to her , the Han whistle , all of this , 2,000 years ago .
And you can already see that it &apos;s weakened most of what &apos;s known today as East China , which is populating most of the population of China in the past and in the present .
What &apos;s unusual about this is that what gives China the sense of being China , what gives Chinese their identity as Chinese , does not come from a time window of hundreds of years not from the time of the nation-state , as has happened in the West , but , if you will , it folds as a civilization country .
I think , examples of this can be seen , in practices like the ancestor table , and like a very defined view of the country , and in a similar way , a very diverse view of the family , social ties like genomics , communications like communications and so on .
All of these , from the time of civilization .
In other words , China , unlike Western countries and most countries of the world , is shaped by a sense of civilization , existed as a country of civilization and not as a nation-state .
And there &apos;s one thing to add about this , which is : Well , we know that China is big , enormous , demographic and geographic , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we &apos;re less aware of is the fact that China is very diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways , very distributed .
You can &apos;t manage this scale from Beijing , although we think it &apos;s the case .
It never was like this .
So this is China , a country of civilization , not a nation-state .
And what does all this mean ?
Well , I believe this has very diverse and radical effects .
I &apos;ll demonstrate two briefly .
The first is the first political value up for the Chinese is the United States . It &apos;s the density of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : collapse — the breakdown of the Roman Empire .
It &apos;s been absorbed , and it &apos;s been left from now to now .
China , in that period of time , went in exactly the opposite direction , and in a full-blown form , held this great civilization , as a unified civilization country .
The second example is perhaps more prosthetic , and it &apos;s Hong Kong .
Do you remember the transmission of Hong Kong , by the U.K. in 1997 ?
Could you remember what the Chinese Constitutional proposition was ?
One country , two systems of governance .
And I &apos;m ready to bet that almost nobody in the West believed them .
&quot; &quot; Dream deserves . &quot;
When China put her hands on Hong Kong , that &apos;s not going to be the case . &quot; &quot; Now , 13 years later , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different as it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . And why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , in a conceivable way , in a nation-state mindset .
Think about the Union of Germany , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically , the East is swallowed by the West .
One country , one nation , one rule system .
This is the mentality of the nation-state .
But you can &apos;t run a country as a China , a country of civilization , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
It just doesn &apos;t work .
So in fact China &apos;s reaction to the Hong Kong issue as the Taiwan issue had a natural response : one civilization , many systems of governance .
Let me suggest another building block , to try to understand China — maybe a point that &apos;s not so comfortable .
Chinese have a very different view of race in relation to most other countries .
Do you know , because out of 1.3 billion Chinese , more than 90 percent of them think they &apos;re the same race , the breed race .
This is a completely different view , from the one that &apos;s earned in the most populated country in the world .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all multi-racial .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel that way .
China is multicultural only in the edges .
So the question is , why ?
The reason I think , fundamentally , is , again , back to the state of civilization .
The history of at least 2,000 years , the history of conquering , taking over , recording , confusing , etc . , led to the process on its own , over time , this nation — Han , created — of course , was fed by a very strong sense of cultural identity .
The fundamental advantage of this historical experience was that without the host , China was never able to stay united .
The identity of Han was the asylum that held this country united .
The great downside was that Manhattan had a very weak view of cultural diversity .
They really believe in their own ideas , and they &apos;re hopeless for those who don &apos;t belong to them .
From that , you found , for example , residents and Tibetans .
Or — let me introduce you to my third building block , the Chinese country .
Well , the relationship between the country and the company in China is very different from the Western form .
So , in the West , it &apos;s acceptable to think critically — nowadays for the least — that authority and legitimacy of the country is a function of democracy .
The problem with this assumption is that the Chinese country gets more legitimacy and more authority in Chinese than any Western country .
And the reason for that is because of the fact — well , there are two reasons , I think .
And predictably , it has nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms , China has no democracy at all .
And the reason for that is , first of all , because the country in China gets a ratio — it gets a special meaning in the country actually being representation , the embodiment and the flourishing of Chinese civilization , of the state of civilization .
This is the biggest sacrifice in China to do with a spiritual role .
And the second reason is that , as Europe and North America , the power of the country is challenged all the time — I mean , in the European tradition , historically against church , against the sectors of the country , against traffickers and so on — for millennia , the power of the Chinese state is not challenged .
She had no serious opponents .
And so you can see that the way China &apos;s power was built is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that Chinese have a very different view of the country .
While we tend to see it as invasive , foreign , an actual device whose forces should be restricted or defined or restrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the country that much and so valuable .
The Chinese experience the country as a close person — not only as a close person , in fact , as part of the family — not only , in fact , as part of the family , but the head of the family , the patriarchy of the family .
This is the Chinese perspective of the country — very different from our own .
It &apos;s embedded in society differently than the way it looks in the West .
And I would suggest that , in fact , what we &apos;re dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a kind of new paradigm , which is different than anything we &apos;ve ever thought about before .
Know that China believes in the market and in the country .
I mean , Adam Smith , wrote already in the late 18th century , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And for a little while of Mao , it stays right , pretty much , ever since now .
But this is combined with a very strong country , a field in all .
The country is everywhere in China .
I mean , she runs companies , many of them still have public ownership .
Privacy companies , as big as they are , like Nevo , depend very much on national pennies .
The goals of the economy , and this is what it &apos;s determined by the country .
And the country , of course , is reduced into many other areas of life — as we know it — with something like one-on-one policy .
Moreover , this is an ancient state tradition , a very ancient authoritarian tradition .
I mean , if you want an example of this , the Chinese wall is one example of this .
But there &apos;s more , this is the great canal of China , which started in its fifth century before the sphere .
And its building was completed in the seventh century to the seventh century .
It &apos;s been trafficked over 1800 kilometers , connecting Beijing with the Ananghau and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary infrastructure programs in China , that help us explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other phrases of the country &apos;s ability within China .
And here we have three building blocks trying to understand the difference in China — the state of civilization , the perception of race and nature of the country and its relationship with society .
And yet we insist , most of the time , to think that we can understand China by trusting Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western perceptions .
If you want to know why we &apos;re continuously trying to understand China wrong — our predictions of what &apos;s going to happen in China are wrong — that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately I think , I have to admit that I think the approach to China is a small Western mentality approach .
It &apos;s in a way neglected .
It &apos;s neglected in that sense that we think we are the best , and therefore we are at the universal scale .
And second , it &apos;s an approach of ignorance .
We mandate to give real attitude to the issue of reefs .
You know , there &apos;s an interesting paragraph in Paul Cohen &apos;s book , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen says that the West is thinking of himself as the most cosmopolitical thing of all other cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , he &apos;s the most horizontal product , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that he doesn &apos;t need to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because , at the end of the day it can , if you also need power , get things in its own way .
When the other cultures — actually the rest of the world , in fact — who were in a more convenient position , against the West , had to , with a phosphorus , understand the West , because of the presence of the West in their societies .
And in doing so , the result is that they are more cosmopolitis in many forms than the West .
For example , take the East Asian question .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Today the largest economic region in the world .
And I &apos;m going to tell you now that East Asian , people from East Asia , they &apos;re much more aware of the West than the West on East Asia .
Now , this point is critical , unfortunately , to the present .
Because what happens — back to the diagrams at the beginning — the Goldman Sachs diagram .
What &apos;s happening is that very quickly , historically , the world is driven and designed , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 — very fast embedded on the places in G7 , or the G8 .
And there are two implications for this .
First , the West quickly loses its impact on the world .
It had a good demonstration , actually , a year ago — Copenhagen , the conference to the climate change crisis .
Europe was not at the end discussion table .
When did this happen last time ?
I bet it was , probably , about 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the future as well .
And the second implication is that the world , inevitably , as a result , will become , increasingly , less familiar to us , because it will be designed by cultures and historical events that we don &apos;t know , and we &apos;re not proud of .
And finally , unfortunately — take Europe , America is a little different in this — but the Europeans , passively , I should say , they &apos;re ignorant , they &apos;re not aware of how the world is changing .
Some people — I have an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is shouting a rabbi towards the riot abyss . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s the exaggeration .
But there &apos;s a problem that goes by hand with this — that Europe is slowly bumping into the world — and this is a kind of loss of the sense of the future .
I mean , there were days that Europe , of course , navigated the future safely .
Take the 19th century .
But that , unfortunately , is no longer true .
If you want to feel in the future , and if you want to taste from the future , try China — here &apos;s the old Confucius .
This is a train station you haven &apos;t seen yet .
It doesn &apos;t look like a train station .
This is the Guangzhou new train station for speed trains .
China has already had a greater network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world combined .
Or look at this : this is an idea , but this is an idea that will soon be tried in suburbs of Beijing .
Here &apos;s a bus in front of you , on the top row it carries about 2,000 people .
He &apos;s driving on a railroad on the suburbs , and the cars on the road are driving underneath him .
And it accelerates to about 160 miles an hour .
And this is the way things are going to move , because China has a specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States . China has a huge number of people and saving space .
And this is a solution to where China has lots and lots of cities over 20 million people .
Okay , so how would I want to end ?
Well , what is our approach supposed to be towards this world that we see evolving at an enormous speed before our eyes ?
We think it &apos;s going to have good implications and it &apos;s going to have bad consequences .
But I want to argue , above all , about a very positive picture for the world .
For 200 years , the world was dominated , in fact , by a particle from the world &apos;s psychology .
The part that Europe and the United States represents .
The proposition of countries like China and India — where 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represents the most important expression of democratization in the last 200 years .
Communitions and cultures , which were ignored , which were voiceless , which didn &apos;t listen to the collector , who didn &apos;t know about them , were going to win a new representation in the world .
As humanists , we have to accept , surely , this change , and we have to learn about these civilizations .
The big ship here was the one that caught up in the leadership of Geneva at the beginning of the 15th century on the big journey around the Southern China Sea , the eastern Sea and across the Indian Ocean , to East Africa .
The little boat in front of it was the ship , which is eight years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean .
( Laughter ) Oh , look carefully at this is a silk age painted by Joe in 1368 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
God , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to revolutionize .
But before you wrap a gun or pop a song or pick a color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
When I say revolution , I mean a radical and radical change in our mindset and our behavior — in our thinking and our behavior .
Why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
We need revolution because things don &apos;t work ; we just don &apos;t work .
And it makes me really sad , because I &apos;m tired of things that don &apos;t work .
You know , I &apos;m tired that we &apos;re not using our potential .
I &apos;m tired of the fact that we &apos;re always in the last place .
And we &apos;re in the last place for so many things — for example , in the social area .
We are the last place in Europe in innovation .
Here we are , at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t inform innovation .
We &apos;re in a last place in health care , and it &apos;s an important thing for a general sense of well-being .
And here we are , not just last in the European Union , but also last in Europe all , right at the bottom .
And worst — it only came out three weeks ago , many of you saw this , the Economist Court .
We are the saddest place in the world , compared to GDP per capita &apos;s saddest place in the world .
It &apos;s in the social domain . Let &apos;s look at education .
Where did we rank three weeks ago in another OECD report ?
Recent in — reading , math and science , last .
Business : the lowest understanding of the European Union .
Entrepreneurs are useful for society .
And as a result , what happens ?
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs setting up businesses .
And that bothered the fact that we know that small businesses are the engine of economies .
We &apos;re the ones that employ most people , make the most taxes .
And if our engine is broken , guess what ?
Last place in Europe at GDP per capita .
Last .
So , friends , it &apos;s not surprising , that 62 percent of adults don &apos;t feel optimistic about the future .
We &apos;re miserable , our education is bad , and we have the worst business .
And these are facts , friends .
Not just practical stories , fairy tales .
No .
It &apos;s not some conspiracy that I set up against Bulgaria . It works .
So I think it should be very , very clear that our system is broken .
Our thinking , and our behavior , our operating system of our practices is broken .
We have to change dramatically in our thinking and our behavior to change the face of Bulgaria for the better , for us , for our friends , for our families and for the future .
How did that happen ?
Let &apos;s think positive now . We &apos;ll be positive from now . How did that happen ?
I think we &apos;re in the last place — and it &apos;s going to be dramatic for some of you — because we make ourselves disabled .
We keep ourselves behind because we don &apos;t care about the importance of doing .
I said fun , yeah .
In case some of you forget what it &apos;s like , this is what it looks like .
Babies get fun , kids get fun , adults get fun .
We don &apos;t care about the importance of fun .
And in fact , we &apos;re abusing fun .
And we crawl it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to those three areas .
Social : 45 years of what ?
Communism — of the priority of society and the country across the individual and then the remixation of creativity , the personal expression and innovation .
And where do we value ?
Because you see this . The way we implement , produce and use knowledge is influenced by social and institutional context , which tells us what about communism ?
Being serious .
Being really , really serious .
That &apos;s true .
( Applause ) Be serious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been busted in the park because I let my kids play on the sand .
A God forbid that will play the sand and walk , or even worse — in the water , it will kill them .
I &apos;ve been told already that grandparents and grandparents shouldn &apos;t let kids play so much because life is a big deal and we should train them to the seriousness of life .
We have a memory unit of seriousness that passes to us .
It &apos;s a social gene that goes through heritage .
It &apos;s the seriousness gene .
45 years of this they created what I call the grandmother effect . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And this is how it works .
Step one : The woman says , &quot; &quot; I want a baby . &quot; &quot; Stage two : We have a baby . Great !
But what happens then at stage three ?
I want to go back to work , or because I have to advance my career or I just want to go to drinking coffee .
So I &apos;ll give the baby to a grandmother .
But you can &apos;t forget that Grandma has already been touched by the seriousness gene for 45 years .
So what happens ?
It passes the virus to a baby , and it takes a lot of time — this is a Scotch tree in the picture — until this seriousness gene came out of our operating system .
What happens then ?
It &apos;s entering education where we have an ancient education system that has changed very little in the last 100 years that believes in learning that has tendency and standardization , and reduces the importance of self-expression , self-exploration , doubting , creativity and engaging .
It &apos;s a system that &apos;s immune .
True story : I went to look for my white school .
We got to a little , expensive school like this and they tell me they &apos;ll learn mathematics 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read five times a day and all that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what about games and breaks ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Huh , there won &apos;t be one minute left for their school . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five ! &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
And it &apos;s really a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating informed , robotic workers to get stuck in a guy who &apos;s prepared for them .
But forgive me , today &apos;s problems are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
We need adaptability , the ability to learn to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need mechanical workers .
But no , now our gene goes into action and makes us crawl in the playful importance .
We create robotic workers and relate to them like don &apos;t assets to use them and then throw them away .
What does a typical workplace look like in Bulgaria ?
Automatic will do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
No trust — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
( Laughter ) Reading — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to build a million small processes that can act in their framework so that you don &apos;t get out of the box .
And they limit — don &apos;t use your cell phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t surf the Internet , don &apos;t connect to IM .
It &apos;s because of what &apos;s not professional and not good .
And at the end of the day , it &apos;s an unsatisfying workplace , because you &apos;re under regulation , you &apos;re constrained , you &apos;re not appreciated . And you don &apos;t enjoy .
In the social domain , education and business , you don &apos;t understand the importance of play .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re in the last place , because we don &apos;t understand the importance of amusement .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Steve , it &apos;s ridiculous . What a dual idea .
It can &apos;t be that the reason is fun .
Just fun , it &apos;s stupid . &quot; &quot; We have the seriousness gene .
So I tell you no .
And I &apos;ll show you this in the next part of the speech — the amusement is the catalyst , is the revolution , which we can use to change the face of Bulgaria for the better .
The amusement : our brain is inherently constructed for fun .
Evolution has broken , millions of years ago , the prevention of life and humans .
And you know what ?
Evolution does a very good job of leveraging properties that are not useful to us and choosing properties that give us a competitive advantage .
Nature was not stupid , and he pointed for amusement .
In all the animal kingdom , for example ants , ants play .
You may not know that .
But when they play , they learn the social order and the dynamics of things .
Rats are fun , but it &apos;s something you might not know that rats that are more fun are much more brainstorming , and they &apos;re better at learning skills .
Cats are fun . Well , we all know .
But what you may not know is that clubs that prevent them from the abundance are not able to create social connections .
They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
Bears get fun .
But what you may not know is that bears who play more survivors over time .
Not the bears who learn to fish better survive .
These are the ones that are getting more fun .
And one last interesting study , it was discovered that there was a correlation between amusement and brain size .
The more fun you get , the bigger the brains are .
Dolphins , a relatively large brain , play a lot .
But who do you think the biggest brain is also the main playful ?
We humans .
Children are amusing , we &apos;re amusing — people from all nationalities , from every race , from every color , every religion .
It &apos;s something universal — we &apos;re amusing .
And not just children , also adults .
A cool term : UK — preserved the amusement preparation and the characteristics of young people in adult detail .
And who are the top neutrinos ?
Humans . We play sports .
We do it for fun , or as Olympic competitors , or as professionals .
We play musical instruments .
We dance , we kiss , we sing . We just take over .
Nature has designed us to make fun . Nature to aging .
We &apos;re designed to do it without a continuum — to play and play a lot and not stop .
It &apos;s a huge benefit .
Just as animals have this benefit , so do humans .
For example , it &apos;s shown that this has to encourage natural growth in the amygdala , in an area that is responsible for emotions .
It proved that this improves development in prefrontal cortex where a big part of cognitive activity is done .
As a result , what happens ?
We develop more emotional adolescence if we play more .
You develop better decision-making capabilities if we play more .
And these , friends , they work .
Not an app , not grandmother &apos;s stories , not practical . It &apos;s a sharp and clear science .
These are the benefits of amusing .
It &apos;s a genetic right to have , like walking , speech , vision .
And if we make ourselves disabled about the amusement , we lay our own death just like if it was any other right of dads .
We stop ourselves from moving forward .
A brief exercise for a moment : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without fun .
Imagine a world without theater , without art without poetry , no dance , no soccer , no football , no football , no laughter .
What does a world like this look like ?
Pretty grim .
Very depressed .
And now imagine your workplace .
Happy place ? Alice ?
Or maybe your friends &apos; workplace — we &apos;re here people who think forward .
Is there fun ? Alice ?
Or is it a bump there ? Is it an autocratic place , a regulator , a limitation and a lack of trust and not doubt ?
We have this kind of concept that has become fun is work .
We even feel guilty if you see us playing around at work .
&quot; Oh , my colleagues saw me laugh , they &apos;ll think I probably don &apos;t have a job , &quot; or &quot; &quot; Oh , I have to hide that the boss won &apos;t see me .
It will think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : Our thinking is wrong .
The opposite of fun is not work . The opposite of fun .
He &apos;s depression , depression .
In fact , amusement improves our work .
Just as the benefit of humans and animals , so it &apos;s useful to play in the workplace as well .
For example , it inspires creativity .
It increases our openness to change .
It enhances our ability to learn .
It gives you a sense of purpose and control — two motivated factors that increase productivity , and that &apos;s through amusement .
So before you think of amusement as just something unserious , amusement doesn &apos;t mean mindfulness .
You know , professional athlete enjoying skiing , refer to it seriously , but he loves it .
He enjoys , he &apos;s mostly running .
A doctor can be serious , but laughter is still a great drug .
Our thinking is wrong .
We don &apos;t have to feel guilty .
We need to make fun of it .
A quick example from the corporate world .
FedEx , a simple motto : people , service , profit .
If you treat your people like people , if your relationship to them would be wonderful , they would be more satisfied , satisfied , with a sense of control and purpose .
And what happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
And when customers are communicating to get a service and they &apos;re managing happy people who can make decisions and they &apos;re satisfied , how do they feel customer ? They feel great .
And what do clients who feel great do ?
You buy more of the service you provide , and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
People , service , profit .
Weighing increases productivity , not reducing .
And you might say , &quot; &quot; Well , that might work at FedEx somewhere in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; But it does work in Bulgaria , friends . Two reasons .
One — amusement is a universal issue .
There &apos;s no strange thing about the adults that we can &apos;t play for , except for the seriousness gene that we need to get away from us .
Two — I tried it . I tried it on Scient .
When I got there , the number of happy customers was zero .
Not even one client was ready to turn others to us .
I asked everybody .
Our profit was July .
We had a marginal profit , and unhappy stakeholders .
Through some fundamental changes , changes like enhancing transparency , changes like encouraging self-intent and collaboration , encouraging cooperation , not autocracy , things like focusing on the outcome .
I &apos;m not interested when you get to work in the morning . I &apos;m not interested when you go .
I &apos;m only interested in your clients and your team are happy , and you &apos;re organized in this .
Why would I care if you get to work at 09 : 00 ?
Basically , encouraging pleasure .
By enjoying and making a good atmosphere we &apos;ve been able to change Scient from end to end and within three short years — sounds a lot of time , but change takes time — every customer , from zero clients to all clients , we turned to us , a profit above the average in the industry , and happy stakeholders .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Where do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we won , every year we participated , in one of the best employer ratings in small businesses .
Independent analysis of data that messages anonymously work in surveys .
It can work , and it works in Bulgaria as well .
There &apos;s nothing that stops us , except our mentality about amusement .
So here are some steps that we can take — to conclude — to do with the amusement of this revolution .
First of all , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me just go home and think about it a little bit or something .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t have the sense of insanity , you have to rediscover it .
What it was like when you were a kid who made you enjoy , or you enjoyed him six months ago , but now you get to advance you can &apos;t enjoy it anymore , because you feel that you must be serious , you will rediscover it .
It doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s mountain climbing or reading books , or playing .
Rediscover it , because you are the leaders , the news leaders , lead to thinking .
You &apos;re the ones who have to go back to the office or talk to friends and save the passionate change in the playful revolution .
You have to , and if you don &apos;t feel it , your colleagues , your employees , they won &apos;t feel it either .
You have to go back and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; A strange idea . I got you to work . I &apos;m supposed to trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to advise you , and I &apos;m going to save authorities to the lowest moments , rather than heights .
I &apos;m going to encourage intelligence criticism .
I &apos;ll let you shake authority .
Because in fact , through challenging the way things have been done since then , we can never get out of the hole that we are in and bring innovative solutions to today &apos;s problems .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
We &apos;re going to explore the fear of the root .
The fear is the enemy of the decade .
And we &apos;re going to do things like completely eliminating the limitations .
Let them use the mobile phone for personal conversations — God forbid .
Let them surf the Internet .
Let them connect to chat .
Let them go for long lunch .
The lunch time is like the school break .
It &apos;s when you go out into the world and you recharge the brain , meet friends , drink beer , eat a little bit , talk , there &apos;s a synergy of ideas that you might not have before .
Forget them to do that . Give them that freedom , and generally — let them play . Let them enjoy the workplace .
So much of our lives are going through us in the workplace , and what should it be ? A place of soft work , which in 20 years from now , will wake up and say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s all ?
Is that all it was ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not acceptable .
( Laughter ) So in closing , we need a dramatic shift in thinking and behavior , but we don &apos;t need a working revolution .
We don &apos;t need a worker revolution .
What we need is the uprising of people who are amusing . What we need is the uprising of people who are amusing . What we need is the uprising of people who are amusing .
Seriously , we need to partner together today is the beginning of the insurgency , but what you need to do is to ignite the fire of the revolution . You have to go out and share your ideas and your success stories .
What has succeeded on the March injection of our lives , our schools , and our work through the enrichment , about how engagement produces a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; about how innovation and productivity play ; and ultimately , how engagement creates meaning .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do it and we share this idea of amusement , we can change Bulgaria &apos;s face for the better .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start by giving you and all it requires is this : Change your posture for two minutes .
But before that , I &apos;m going to ask you to now look at your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
How many of you minimize yourself like this ?
Sometimes we hold our arms like this .
Sometimes we stretch . I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
The language of the body fascinates us , and we &apos;re particularly interested .
We &apos;re interested , as you know — ( Laughter ) in interaction or bizarre smile , or a goat &apos;s view , or a dead eye bomb , or maybe even something like a handshake .
Narrator : Here they go to &#91; House &#93; Number 10 , and see what happens .
Even for BBC and The New York Times .
So clearly , when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — as sociologists we call it non-verbal communication — it &apos;s language , so what comes to mind is communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
There are many reasons to believe that this is the right way to look at it .
We all infer conclusions and come to inclusive hypotheses from the body language .
These suggestions can predict significant occurrences in life like who we employ or promote , who we go out to date .
For example , Nelanie Amdi , a researcher at the University of Texas , showed that when people watch 30-second Islamic videos about the interaction that occurs between a doctor and a patient , the opinion that they surrender the kindness of the doctor can predict if the doctor will sue .
If you didn &apos;t use them right , you failed .
We are also influenced by our non-verbal communication , our thoughts , our emotions and our physiology .
So what non-verbal communication do I talk about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study bias , I teach in college to teach businesses in a competitive world , so it was inevitable that I would be interested in the dynamics of power .
I was particularly interested in non-verbal manifestations of power and control .
And what are nonverbal manifestations of power and control ?
In the world of animals , the phrases are about tension .
You increase your size , you stretch , you grab space , basically you open up .
It &apos;s about development , and it &apos;s true all over the world .
This movement , known as pride , was studied by Jessica Tricky . It showed you .
We narrow ourselves . We don &apos;t want to stumble upon the person next to us .
And this is what happens when you put together with authority .
So if someone protects kidneys , we tend to reduce ourselves . We don &apos;t imitate it .
I watch this behavior in the classroom , and what do I see ? I see that the students of business are actually protesting .
When they sit down , they kind of go wrong in space .
For other people , they kind of collapse when they enter , once they enter , they see it .
I &apos;ve noticed some things about this .
Women do this more than men . Women feel consistently .
Less powerful than men , so it &apos;s not surprising , but the other thing I noticed is that .
Transplantation is very important in a business class , because participation determines half the score .
So the institutions for the business administration are trying to deal with this gender gap .
So I started to wonder , there are the students who come like this , and they take part of the classes .
There are some evidence that it is .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but also , when we have to smile by holding a pen between the teeth , like this , it makes us feel happy .
It works in both directions . When it comes to power .
So the second question was , we know that thoughts change the body , but is it true that the body also changes thoughts ?
And when I say thoughts , what do I actually talk about ?
What does someone &apos;s thoughts look like ?
Not surprisingly , powerful people tend to be more transparent and self-confident , more optimistic .
They even feel they &apos;re going to win luck games .
So there are many differences . They take more risks .
But the truth is that power is also how you respond to stress time .
Do we want a strong leader that is dominant , full of testosterone , but one that &apos;s stressful at a brief time ?
Probably not . We want a person .
So we have proof that the body can affect the thoughts , at least in a flat way , and that role-changing can affect the thoughts .
Suppose somebody &apos;s embracing a role , what happens if they do it at a minimum level , a small manipulation , a small intervention will flow ?
Another two .
You can sit or stand .
And here &apos;s the posture of power .
Copatients , they narrow themselves .
When you touch the neck , you touch the neck .
And this is how it happens . They go in .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
That &apos;s what we found about testosterone .
Again , two minutes and you get all these changes .
That &apos;s what you get about Curtisol .
That &apos;s why our non-verbal communication seems to affect , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not just because of others , but it &apos;s also about us .
Our bodies also change our thoughts .
So we think that what &apos;s important , that is , where you should use it like situations that have a threat from the environment , where you evaluate it .
It &apos;s not about talking to other people .
It &apos;s about talking to yourself . What do you do ?
That &apos;s what we want to look at .
It takes five minutes . They &apos;re recorded .
So for five minutes , nothing , which is worse than you get stuck in the middle .
People hate it . That &apos;s what Marine L-Prince calls .
And then there are the types that watch recordings .
They have no idea about hypotheses or conditions at all .
It &apos;s about living that they bring into their words .
Things like this . People bring their real selves with them .
That &apos;s what makes the impression , or at least helps it form .
So I say , fake until you get me not — that &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to go there and then still feel like a predictor .
I don &apos;t want to feel like a predictor .
When I was 19 , I went through a hard road accident .
I was thrown out of the car and rolling several times .
I woke up in the rehabilitation .
I was aware of my Kiko Islands because I was known as brilliant , and I was beaten as a child .
I was forced to retire from school and I kept trying to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t be able to finish school .
I &apos;m a predictor .
You &apos;re going to leave and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
I really do it . &quot; &quot; And so that &apos;s what I did . Five years in an adult school .
But she does , and I understand the feeling .
I mean , it can fake , it can become like this .
It changed .
So I want to tell you , don &apos;t fake until you do that .
Watch until you become like this .
Do it enough times until you move what you need and become like this .
The last thing I &apos;m going to tell you is this .
Small mechanisms can lead to big changes .
That &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s what you need to do . Design your brain .
That the testosterone will go up and the Curiosity will go down .
Don &apos;t get out of the situation in the feeling you didn &apos;t know who you really are .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Big creativity . In times of need , we need big creativity .
Speaking . Great creativity is amazing , absurd , rationally , rationally , powerful .
Big creativity can spread patience , victory of liberty , make education sound like a brilliant idea .
( Laughter ) Big creativity can turn a sperm on a drill , or show a person who has other options except a frog .
Big creativity can make politicians select , or parties not choose .
It can go to war to look like a tragedy or a joke .
Creativity is the journalist who put passwords about our T-shirts and maybe our lips .
The pioneer shows the simple way through the undefined moral embarrassment .
Science is smart , but big creativity is less familiar , more magical , and now we need the magic .
That &apos;s the goal that we need it .
Climate is changing fast , too fast .
And big creativity has to do what it does very well : to stimulate us to think differently with creative thinking breakthrough .
We &apos;re tempted to act differently , with creative pieces of fun .
Here &apos;s an example of an initiative piece of creativity that I &apos;m involved in using creativity that will make people work more green .
Video : Man : You know , instead of driving today , I &apos;m going to go .
Number one : So he went , and as he went , he saw things .
Strange and wonderful that otherwise he wouldn &apos;t see .
A god scratching his leg . A flying motorcycle .
The father and his daughter are separated from the bike by a mysterious wall .
And then he stopped . She went in front of him .
The woman with the child rushed with him through the fields and broke his heart .
Obviously , she got a little older .
You can say she &apos;s aging a lot .
But he felt all his old answers to return .
Ford , he said very gently . It was her name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say any word , August , &quot; &quot; she said , because it was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent near the crystal , exactly 300 yards away .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . Inside the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford spread , and he opened one foot , and after that one another .
Gosti walked into her bold and gave her love at a uniform rate and at the same time she was photographing , because she was a passionate amateur of porn movies .
The land moved both .
And they lived together happily until this day .
And this is all because he decided to walk that day .
( Applause ) Andy Hosseum says : We have the science , we had the debate .
The moral pressures are already on the table .
Big creativity takes to take everything and make it simple and sharp .
Make it connect . Make it work .
So this is a call , a request , to the very talented community of TED .
Let &apos;s be creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Bluto Lutu : So , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Okay .
So I &apos;m going to count for you , so we don &apos;t do it together .
Okay , one , two , three . Audience : Can you read it ?
BG : Incredible . What about that ? One , two , three . Audience : You don &apos;t read it .
BG : Well , one , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were a Portuguese , right ? And what about that ? One , two , three .
Audience : What do you read ?
BG : What do you read ? There are no words here .
I said to read what you see . Right ?
And it says , &quot; &quot; Hmm Row ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you had to answer . Right ? Why is that ?
Because perception is fundamental in our experience .
Right ? The brain takes incompatible information and finds what it has , which is , we never see what it is , we don &apos;t see information , we just see what was useful for us to see in the past .
All right ? The meaning , in terms of perception , is that we &apos;re all similar to this frog .
( Laughter ) It gets information . It produces useful behavior for her . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : A ! A ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go like we wanted , we get a little upset , right ?
But we &apos;re talking here about perception , OK ?
And perception confirms everything we think , knows what we believe , hope , dream , wear how we fall in love , everything starts with perception .
If perception is fundamental in our history , it means that we always respond depending on what we &apos;ve done before .
But in fact , it &apos;s a huge problem , because it means we &apos;re always going to see things the same way .
So I want to tell you a story about revision , and all the new perceptions start in a similar way .
They start with a question .
The problem with questions is that they create uncertainty .
And uncertainty is a bad thing . Evolution is a bad thing . If you &apos;re uncertainty about a predator , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even sea disease is a result of uncertainty .
If you &apos;re in the belly Annah , your inner ear says you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because they &apos;re moving in the coordination of the ship , say you &apos;re standing without moving .
The brain can &apos;t deal with the uncertainty of this information , and it gets sick .
The question &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things , because it leads you to uncertainty .
And yet , ironically , the only way you can ever do something new is to drive into this space .
How can we ever do something new ? Luckily , evolution provides us an answer , right ?
And it allows us to deal with even the hardest questions , the best questions are ones that create the greatest uncertainty .
These are the questions that undermine existing truths . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how life started , or what &apos;s beyond the universe , but to ask about what you think you already know is really taking risk .
So what is the answer of evolution to the problem of uncertainty ?
Play .
Play is not just a process . Experts in the game will say it &apos;s a form of emergence .
Play is the only human occupation in which uncertainty is blessed , uncertainty is what makes a game fun .
Play corresponds to changes , right ? It &apos;s open to possibilities , and it &apos;s sharing . Play is actually our way of creating social connections , and it &apos;s driven by itself . That is , we &apos;re playing to play . The game is the reward itself .
If you look at these five forms of being , you &apos;ll notice that these are the same emergent shapes that are required to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the grateful part of an article .
It &apos;s actually defined by the form of the experience , the one here , and it grabs everything creative .
If you add laws to play , we have a game .
This is the essence of a scientific experiment .
So , with these two ideas , that science is the experience and experiments are a game , we asked , can anyone be a scientist ?
And who is better to ask than 25 children at age 8-10 ?
Because they &apos;re experts in games . So I took my bee scene to a small school in a bon , and the goal of that was not only to get kids to see science in another light , but through a scientific process , to see themselves differently . Right ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Here I have to say we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because scientists said that small kids couldn &apos;t add a significant contribution to science , and the teachers said the same thing .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So here are some of the questions . I wrote them in a little letter so you wouldn &apos;t have to read it . The point is that five of the children &apos;s questions were actually the basis of scientific publications in the last five or 15 years . You know ?
So they asked questions that were meaningful to experts .
Now I want to share the stage with someone rather special . Okay ?
She &apos;s one of the young people involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the world &apos;s youngest scientists who published their work , and once you get on the stage , she becomes the youngest speaker who ran at TED . You know ?
Now , science and asking questions is a matter of courage .
And it &apos;s the human expression of courage , because it &apos;s going to stand here now and talk to you .
So Aimee , are you ready to come up here please ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Aimee &apos;s going to help me tell the story about what &apos;s called the Blakton Bee Project , and first she &apos;ll tell you about the question they thought about . So go ahead , Aimee .
AM : Thank you very much , Be . We thought it was easy to see the relationship between humans and apes in the way we think , because we &apos;re similar to each other .
But we wondered if there might be anything to do with other animals , it would be amazing to find that humans and bees think in the same way , because they look so different from us .
So we asked if human beings and bees might solve complex problems similarly .
In fact , we wanted to know if bees could adapt to new situations through rules and conditions that have been studied before , so what if bees can think like us ?
Well , it would be amazing , because it &apos;s just a million neurons here .
But it makes sense that they can , because bees , like us , can detect a good flower regardless of an hour a day , light , weather , or whatever angle they approach to the flower . ( Applause ) AL : The next step was to design an experiment , which is basically a game . So the kids went and designed this experiment , and so — well , the players — and so , Aimee , can you tell us what the game was , and what the beekeeping were doing ?
EA : The puzzle that we thought about was according to the rules of a mother then .
We asked the bees to learn not only to reach a particular color , but to reach a flower in a particular color only when it &apos;s in a particular pattern .
They only got a prize if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
There are several different rules that bees can learn , to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
What was really exciting about this project was ours and where there was no idea if it was going to work .
It was completely new , and nobody had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) RL : Including teachers , and it was a very difficult teacher .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to walk without having any idea what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so a lot of the credit comes to Dave Strawick , who was the collaborator in this project . Right ?
I &apos;m not going to go through all the details of the study now because you can actually read about it , but the next step is a observation . So here are some of the students at the time of the observation . They collect information about where the bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strawick : What we &apos;re going to do — student : 5C .
DG : She &apos;s still going here ? Student : Yeah .
DG : So follow each . Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
BG : Can you help me here , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist would say this , huh ?
Student : There are two up there .
And three in here .
BG : Okay ? So we have observations . We have raw data .
They do the simple math , average , etc .
And we know we want to share the data . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write it and try to apply it to advertising . Okay ? So you have to write it .
So we go , of course , to the pub . Right ? ( Laughter ) The glass on the left is mine , OK ? ( Laughter ) I tell them , in the article there are four different parts : progress , research method , outcomes , discussion .
Anesthesia writes what the question is and why ?
In the research method , you write , what did you do ? In the results , what happened in the observation ?
And in the discussion , who cares about it ? Right ?
It &apos;s a scientific paper , largely . ( Laughter ) So the kids gave me the words , right ? I connected to the narrative , which means this article was written in children &apos;s language .
And I didn &apos;t write that . Put it Aimee and the other students in the classroom . As a result , this scientific paper starts with , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In the episode of results , it says , &quot; &quot; Step of training , the puzzle ... What a stretch ! &quot; &quot; Did you get it ? ( Laughter ) And in a way , it says , &quot; &quot; And then we put the bees inside the fridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to try it out . ( Laughter )
So there &apos;s the title page here . We have a number of writers here .
These are all emphasized letters that are 8-10 years old .
The first author is an elementary school in Luckton , because if you ever get it , it will be &quot; &quot; Blakton and Shoots , &quot; &quot; and not one person &apos;s name . So we submitted the article to a public magazine , and he says that . He said a lot of things , but he said that .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the article failed to control our quality in a variety of different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts with &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the data was written in colorful pencils , etc . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we said we &apos;d go to peer review . We sent the article to Yale Purroughs , from the National Academy of Sciences , the world experts , and he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the most famous drama .
Larry Malloney , an expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The article is great .
The work would be published if it was written by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We brought it back to the editor .
They said no .
So we asked Mary and Natalie to write a interpretation that would place the findings for scientists , right ? We put in the plans , and we filed it into a biologist Laters .
The article criticized five independent visitors , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do science , it took two years to publish it . ( Laughter ) A typical science , actually , isn &apos;t it ? So it does Aimee and her friends to the young scientists in the world who published their work .
And how were the responses ?
Well , the article was published two days before Christmas , dropped it 30,000 times on the first day , right ?
It was the selection of the editor in the Science journal , the leading journal in science .
It will always have free access to it in a biologist Laters .
This is the only article that will ever be available for free in this magazine .
Last year , this was the second article in the amount of download in Biogie Laters , and the responses , not just from scientists and teachers , but from the general public as well .
And I &apos;ll just read one of them .
&quot; &quot; I read &quot; Dorbury Blakton recently . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have words to describe exactly how I feel right now .
What you &apos;ve done , folks , is real , honest and amazing .
Curiosity , interest , innocence and enthusiasm are the most fundamental and important things to engage in science .
Who would have it if not kids ?
Please welcome the children &apos;s team in my name . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah . Okay .
We said science involves risk , so it &apos;s a huge risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Yeah ? Because we just did it once in the past . ( Laughter ) And you love technology , right ?
Evan Schachen : Yeah , but I love myself .
BG : That &apos;s the embodiment of technology . Okay .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demo , OK ?
You have to close your eyes , and you have to vote , to where you hear my applause . Okay ?
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Okay , what if everyone there screamed . One , two , three ?
Audience : ( Shouting ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouting ) ( Laughter ) Perfect . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
Everyone &apos;s there screaming . ( Shouting ) Where &apos;s the voice coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
Yes ? We go through life and we always respond , but if we ever want change , we have to go into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , it &apos;s possible for him to see the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to enter uncertainty through the play process , right ?
Now , real education for science , I think it should be based on giving people a voice and allowing them to express this voice , so I asked my mom to be the last voice in this short story .
So , Aimee ?
EA : This project was really exciting to me , because it inspired the process of discovery , and it showed me that everyone , really everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a great discovery .
Changing in someone &apos;s mindset about something can be easy or hard , all depends on how the person feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy , once we played the games and started thinking about the puzzle , I realized that science is not just a boring profession , and that everybody can discover something new .
I just need an opportunity . My opportunity came with it , and the bees project from Blakton .
Thank you . BG : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
In this talk I &apos;m going to talk about the world &apos;s biggest problems .
I &apos;m not going to talk about the skeptical climate researcher , probably it &apos;s a good choice too .
( Laughter ) This is a book that the professor put together , but I will answer the question — what are the biggest problems in the world .
And before I start , I &apos;m going to ask each and every one of you , to pull out a pen and paper , so you can help me look at this .
So take out your pen and paper .
Ultimately , the world faces many problems .
I &apos;ll just run some of them .
800 million people are hungry for bread .
A billion people don &apos;t have clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation solutions .
Millions of people die of AIDS .
And the list goes on .
The lives of about two billion people will change the sugar without climate change , etc .
There are many , many problems in the world .
And in a perfect world , we would solve all of them , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And so the question we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why the talk belongs to the economics issue — is , if we don &apos;t solve all the problems , what problems should we solve before ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;m going to ask you .
If we were to have 50 billion dollars for the next four years , installed for improving the world , what should we have invested them ?
We &apos;ve identified the 10 great challenges facing the world , and I &apos;ll go through them quickly . Climate change , infectious disease , wars and conflict , education , economic instability , government corruption , hunger and malnutrition , refugees and mass migration , sanitation and water availability , and trade barriers .
We think this list includes the world &apos;s biggest problems .
The immediate question for you is what problems you have on your list .
And how can we start to solve them ?
But this is a problematic question .
That &apos;s the question we asked at a conference on a bus in January .
And it &apos;s problematic to ask people to focus only on problems .
Because we can &apos;t really solve problems .
The biggest problem in the world is that we &apos;re all dead .
But on the other hand , we don &apos;t have the ability to solve it .
So the task is not to prioritize problems , but to prioritize the solutions that are there for problems .
And these will be — of course , the business starts to get complicated .
Climate problems will have a protocol Kyoto .
The pathogenic diseases include clinics and mosquito networks .
Democrats and wars — U.N. peacekeeping forces , etc .
Something I want you to do is , in 30 seconds , and I know this is an impossible task , to write what you think are the first priorities on the list .
And also — and this is the part of an economy as a carelessness — to register what the things that shouldn &apos;t be at the top of the list .
What do you think should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please , take 30 seconds , talk to those around you , and try to recruit the highest and low priorities on the list of solutions available to the big problems in the world .
The critical part of the process , which I &apos;d like to give you an opportunity to experience , but I only have 18 minutes , and I &apos;ve dedicated to you a significant part of my time .
It &apos;s going into the process itself and thinking about it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
I recommend to you in the heat , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll have discussions about this later , thinking about how you can do this kind of priority .
And of course , you ask yourself , how has such a priority never been done ?
And one reason is that surplus can have a very unpleasant process .
And nobody wants to do it .
Of course every organization would like to be on top of a list like this .
But each organization was also very unhappy not to be at the top of the list .
And since there are many more places that are not the first place , than places that are the first place on the list , it just makes sense that you don &apos;t want to create a list like this .
We set up the U.N. nearly 60 years ago , but we never made a list of all the things that we can do in the world , and we asked , what are those done before ?
But it doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t prioritize , any decision is a priority , so we still prioritize , just not publicly — and it &apos;s probably less good than prioritizing after we thought and discussed it .
So what I &apos;m actually saying is , for a long time we &apos;ve had a menu of possibilities .
There are many , many things we can do in the world , but so far we haven &apos;t had the prices and the periods .
We had no idea about them .
Imagine you &apos;re in a restaurant , and you get a huge menu , but you have no idea what the price of the dose is .
You want to order a pizza , but you have no idea how much it costs .
The price can be one dollar or 1,000 dollars .
It might be a family pizza , or a personal pizza .
We should know these things .
And that &apos;s exactly what Consensus Copenhagen is trying to actually do , trying to get these issues going .
The process in which Consensus Copenhagen was like this .
We cut 30 of the best economists in the world , three out of every field on the list .
So the three economists who are leading to climate change .
Look at what we can do , what cost , and what benefits we can produce .
Similarly in infectious diseases .
Three of the best experts in the world are asking , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do and what the results will be .
And so on .
Then we did some of the best economists in the world , eight of them , including Nobel laureates , in Copenhagen in May of 2004 .
We called them &quot; The Dreams Choice . &quot; &quot; Cambridge University preferred to call them a disturbing rabbit of the economy .
It &apos;s a very good tool in Europe , but not so much here in the United States .
And this group worked on the preferred list .
And you ask , why not economists ?
And of course I &apos;m very happy you &apos;ve asked . ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s a great question .
The point is that if you want to know about malaria , you would ask an expert for malaria .
If you wanted to know about climate , you would ask an expert for climate .
But if you wanted to prioritize both domains , you couldn &apos;t ask the experts themselves , because they don &apos;t engage in priorities .
That &apos;s the role of economists .
They &apos;re about flying .
They &apos;re the ones that decide , a disgusting decision in a sense , what &apos;s in high priority , and what &apos;s in low priority and you can do afterwards .
So this is the list I want to share with you .
And of course you can read it on our website , and I have no doubt that we will discuss it during the day .
On the list there are bad projects that mean that for projects where every dollar you invest , you get less than a dollar back .
Also , there are reasonable projects , good projects , and great projects .
And of course we need to start from the excellent projects .
I &apos;m going to start with the end , so we &apos;ll end with the excellent projects .
So these are the worst projects .
And as you can see , climate change is at the bottom of the list .
This location hits a lot of people , and it &apos;s probably one of the places people tell me I need to go and not go back .
But I want to talk about this issue with you , because it &apos;s intriguing .
Why is the subject at the bottom of the list ?
And I &apos;ll also go back to this during the talk , because it &apos;s probably one of the issues where there &apos;s a difference between my list and the list that you wrote .
The reason the group said that Protocol Kyoto , or doing something similar to him , is a bad project , is that it &apos;s a very inefficient project .
The group didn &apos;t say global warming is not a real phenomenon .
Or it &apos;s not a serious problem .
But the group said that given the means that we have , we can do very little at very high cost .
What they showed us through economic models is that if everyone participates in Kyoto , it will cost the world 150 billion dollars a year .
And this is a very significant cost .
It &apos;s two to three times the aid that the world is giving to developing countries every year .
But the improvement we &apos;re going to get is relatively small .
All models show that Kyoto will reject warming by about six years by 2100 .
So the guy in Bangladesh who was flooded in 2100 , would only be flooded in 2106 .
And that &apos;s improvement , but not significant improvement .
The bottom line is we spent a lot of money on a small improvement .
And just to have a framework for reference , according to the U.N. estimates , for half of this cost , which means about 75 billion dollars a year , we can solve all the fundamental problems in the world .
We can provide drinking water , sanitation , basic health care and education for everyone on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice as much for a very small improvement ?
Or invest half the cost and get an amazing improvement ?
And that &apos;s why climate change is a bad project .
We don &apos;t say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t .
We say if we don &apos;t have , it &apos;s not the first priority .
The likely projects — and I &apos;m going to skip through some of them , for disease , extension of health care has been able to cross the threshold , because extension of basic health care is a great thing .
It will make significant improvement , but very high cost .
This rating shows us what happens when you look at both sides of the equation .
The good projects have a lot of sanitation projects and water .
Because sanitation and water are particularly important , but they also require expensive infrastructure .
I want to show you the four highest priorities , which should be at least among the first solutions to do , when we talk about dealing with the world &apos;s problems .
The fourth project in Tobo is malaria — dealing with malaria .
Two billion are infected with malaria every year .
And the cost of the disease may be approaching about one percent of GDP , every year in the infected countries .
If we spend about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we can reduce that cost to half .
We can prevent half a million people from dying , and perhaps most importantly , we can prevent from one billion people from infecting disease every year .
A fact that will help them significantly overcome the other problems in their lives , and in the long term also with global warming .
The third project in Tobo is to promote free trade .
Our models have shown that if we can promote free trade , and specifically reduce the subsidies in Europe and the United States , we can revive the global economy , and bring it to the incredible amount of 2,400 billion dollars a year , from which about half in the third world .
The point is that we can spend between 200 and 300 million people of poverty , in a very short time — between two and five years .
This is the third effort in Tobo that we can do .
The second issue in Tobo is hunger and malnutrition .
Not malnutrition in the larger sense , but a very cheap way to deal with nutritional problems that come from lack of specific factors .
About half the world &apos;s population is suffering from iron deficit , zinc , David Witamin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we can achieve significant achievements in this problem .
That would be the second investment in Tobya .
And the best project is about HIV virus .
If we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we can prevent 28 million people from becoming HIV infected .
And also within this topic , we &apos;re focusing on . There are two different ways of dealing with HIV .
One is treatment , the other is prevention .
And also here , in a perfect world , we would invest in both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t invest in any one person , or at least we don &apos;t do them particularly well , we have to ask ourselves which possibility to invest first .
And expensive care at scale versus prevention .
So we &apos;re actually focusing on the fact that we can achieve much more by focusing on prevention .
For the price we invest , we can get some improvement through treatment , or 10 times more by prevention .
So we choose to focus on preventing treatment at least at first .
It &apos;s a thinking that forces it to focus on our priorities .
I &apos;m asking you to look at your page and see , did you get to our list ?
Or have you arrived close ?
One of the key issues is climate change .
Many people think we &apos;re not likely to do that .
We also need to do climate change , even because it &apos;s a huge , significant problem .
But it &apos;s important to remember , we &apos;re not taking care of all the problems .
There are many , many problems in the world .
And I want to make sure that the problems that we &apos;re focusing on , are the right problems .
The issues we can bring to significant improvement , not a small improvement .
Thomas Schelling , one of the Dream team , expressed it very well .
One important thing that we tend to forget is that in 100 years , when climate change is fully interacting , the people in the world are going to be very rich than today .
The most pessimistic predictions of the United Nations .
The provinces that in 2100 , the average person in the third world will be as rich as I am and you are today .
And very likely , it will be twice as rich or four times as rich .
Of course we &apos;re getting richer .
But the point is that when we talk about saving or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we don &apos;t deal with poor Indian .
It &apos;s relatively wealthy .
And it &apos;s important to ask , do we want to invest a lot , and help a little richer , in 100 years from now ?
Or do we want to help the poor really , today , in Bangladesh , who really need our help , and that we can help them cheaply ?
As Leng put it — imagine if you were a wealthy Chinese , as you would be , or a wealthy Bolybean , or a wealthy Congo seat in 2100 , who thinks of 2005 , wondering , &quot; &quot; How strange they worried about helping me deal with climate change ; but worry so little about helping my grandfather , and his dad , although they could help them a lot more , and they really needed this help . &quot; &quot; I think we needed our own business statement .
Even if they will hide the traditional way we saw this problem .
And of course the traditional way went wrong because climate change is great .
Think about the movie &quot; &quot; The day after tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , doesn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that it attracts people to see it , but don &apos;t expect a manual to cast Brad Pitt into his next movie , which is about cleaning latrines in Tanzania . ( Laughter ) It just won &apos;t be a photogenic movie .
So I think , in many ways , Consensus Copenhagen and all the debate about global priorities is a protective for too boring problems .
It ensure that we remember the goal is not to make ourselves feel good .
And not to address the problems that get a broad media coverage , but to invest in issues where we can bring significant improvement .
Another common resistance , which is important to mention , suggests that you can &apos;t really choose one on the other .
And we had to address all the problems , and in a perfect world , I would agree with a full heart .
I think we need to address all the problems too , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided to invest twice what we &apos;re investing today in aid to developing countries .
Since the scale of our aid has been cut in half .
So we &apos;re not in the right direction if we want to solve all the world problems .
Another claim is about war in Iraq .
We spend 100 billion dollars on it . Why don &apos;t we invest that money in improving the world ?
I &apos;m for the idea .
And if anyone here can convince Bush to give it a big deal , great .
But the principle doesn &apos;t change — even if we get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to invest them best , don &apos;t we ?
The fundamental thing is to self-relieve , and conquer the right priorities .
I just want to address the question of whether we &apos;re safe on our list .
Because when you ask the world &apos;s leading economists , it &apos;s inevitably a group of white and older Americans .
And that &apos;s not necessarily the best point of view of the world .
So we invited 80 young people around the world , and we asked them to do the same job .
The only requirements were that they would be students , and they would be English speakers .
Most of them came from developing countries .
They worked with the same data , but they could extend the discussion to other issues , and they did so to reach their own list .
And the big surprise was that the lists were very similar , with malnutrition and disease at the top of the list , and climate change at the bottom .
We repeated the process many times .
We set up slogans with university students , and other meetings .
And we &apos;ve always reached a very similar list .
And this fills me with hope and believes that there &apos;s a way to start thinking about the right priorities , and that you can ask , &quot; What &apos;s important to do in the world ? &quot;
And of course in a perfect world , we were happy to do everything .
But since we don &apos;t do everything , we have to think about what to do before .
I think Consensus Copenhagen is a process .
We started it in 2004 , and we hope to attract a lot of people , and get better information towards 2008 and 2012 .
Mapping the right path to the world , and also thinking about how you do political performance imagination .
To get used to say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not do the things we &apos;re going to get a little bit at a very high cost , we &apos;re not going to do the things we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the things we can get a huge improvement , a low cost , already . &quot; &quot; In the bottom line , you might not agree with the results of the propeller and the discussion that led to them , but we should be honest with ourselves , and because there are things that we &apos;re doing , and things that we &apos;re not doing .
If we try to deeply address certain issues , we will not necessarily address some of the other issues .
So I hope this process will help us prioritize better , and think about how we can work better in the world .
Thank you .
The year is 1800 .
You &apos;re talking about a little invention that sparks curiosity .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
It allows you to see tiny vibrations hidden from the normal eye .
Soon after that comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are the cause of terrible diseases in humans .
Think about what happens in society when you find out that Mother Angola has been drinking her tea from soup containing monsters , not far from here . The picture from London .
Go ahead 200 years .
We still have the monster soup , and it thrives in the developing countries around the tropical leash .
Just because of malaria , there &apos;s a million deaths every year , and more than a billion people and women need diagnosis because they &apos;re at risk of disease in different contexts of malaria .
It &apos;s actually very simple to recognize many of these monsters .
You take a variety , for example , a chemical compound in orange , or a fluorescent orange or a jamming , and a microscope , and you look at them .
All of them can be identified .
So why is Alex in Kenya , Fatma in Bangladesh , Najevet in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda , still waiting many months for diagnosis to tell them their party ?
It happens mainly because the resilience of diagnostics is outside reach .
And remember the number : One billion .
The problem is in the microscope itself .
Even though it &apos;s the top of modern science , the microscope of research is not built for open space use .
They were never designed in the first place for diagnostics at all .
They &apos;re heavy , they &apos;re rainfall , they &apos;re hard to restore , and they cost a lot of money .
In this picture , Mahatma Gandhi in the 1940s uses the same device we use today , to diagnosis tuberculosis in his neck in India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , walked around in India and Thailand , and began to think deeply about the problem .
We &apos;ve seen equipment donated from all kinds .
We &apos;ve seen mushrooms growing on microscope lenses .
We saw people who had a microscope but didn &apos;t even know how to turn it on .
What emerged from that work and that journey was the idea that we call folding microscope .
What is a folding microscope ?
This is a microscope for everything , the theme with light , brightness , polar , transparent and all kinds of microscopic use built just out of paper folds .
Now you say , how is this possible ?
I &apos;ll show you some examples , and we &apos;ll go through them .
It starts with a single sheet of paper .
What you &apos;re looking at here is all the ingredients that are required to build a high-definition microscope and a light that works .
Here are the three elements : there &apos;s the optical component , the light component and the device for the sampling of the sample .
And there &apos;s the microoptics at the bottom that actually is embedded in the paper itself .
What you do is you take it and you sort of play in a toy , and it really is , you release it , you break it down .
There are no instructions here and no language use .
There &apos;s code , the code is jumped by color , which tells us exactly how to fold the microscope .
When you finish , it looks something like this , it has everything in a regular microscope , like a two-dimensional motion surface , a place where the sample surface will sit , for example , right here .
We didn &apos;t want to change it , because it &apos;s a theoretical thing that has come to perfection over the years , and the health care people are used to it .
That &apos;s what &apos;s changed , but the normal orange remains the same as it is for the different diseases .
You put it in .
There &apos;s the two-dimensional dose phase , and then there &apos;s the focus phase , which is a dose mechanism built inside the paper itself and allows us to move and focus the lenses in the bounces of microbes .
What &apos;s most interesting about this product , and my students hate that I do this , but I &apos;ll do anyway , these are devices that can be picked up .
You can turn them around and throw them on the floor and walk on them .
And they hold on , even though they &apos;re made of a very flexible material like paper .
Another funny fact is that we send them as a standard diagnostic tool , but within this envelope there are 30 different folding microscopes , in different forms , all in the same envelope .
I &apos;m going to choose one at random .
This , it turns out , was designed specifically for malaria , because it has the light filters built specifically for the malaria diagnosis .
So the idea of dedicated microscopes to different diagnostics comes from this .
Until now , you haven &apos;t really seen what you can see in one of these shapes .
So what I want to do , if you can dim up the lights please , it turns out that microscopes fold up are also microscopes that radiate .
I have two microscopes here and an effective — I &apos;ll go behind the wall — and I &apos;ll play , this is exactly what I see .
What you see here — ( Applause ) This is a cross-section of a complex eye , and when I get close to it , I &apos;m moving on the Z axis .
You can actually see how the lenses are cut in the pattern of the width incision .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , loves to hate it , a mosquito , sees the sense of solid glass .
Here we go .
It &apos;s all through the simple structure I described .
My wife is driving to test some of our microscopes as my clothing washing every time I forget them dry .
So it turns out they &apos;re resistant in water , ( Laughter ) There &apos;s glamorous water here , I don &apos;t know if you can see it .
This shows you how the projection device works .
You can see the foundation , how it &apos;s launched and bend .
Can we turn on the lights ?
I &apos;m going to show you quickly , because the time is over to me , how much it costs us to make . The brilliant idea was to create a continuous process on a film , so we created it from parts in 50 cents worth of worth of money .
( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new way of working with a microscope , which we call the US-scanning microscopy .
I &apos;m going to show you quickly a few of the pieces that make it .
This is a paper sheet .
That &apos;s when we thought about the idea .
This is A4 paper .
These are the three steps you see .
And the optical ingredients , if you look at the addition on the right , we had to figure out a way to make lenses inside the paper itself at a very high rate , using the process of self-assembling and facial tension to build color-free lenses inside the paper itself .
This is where the lenses sit .
There are some sources of light .
And in particular , at the end of all the parts are arranged because of the folds of paper , because of the fact that folds allow us to have optical precision at the scale of microns .
So even though it looks like a simple toy , the engineering aspects associated with this kind of thing are quite complicated .
Here &apos;s another obvious thing that we would do . If I had to show you that these microscopes are tough and resilient , I would go up to the third floor and throw them away .
So here we did , and they held on .
So for us , the next step is to finish the field testing .
Let &apos;s start at the end of the summer .
We &apos;re at a stage where we &apos;re going to make thousands of microscopes .
This will be the first time we do field experiments with the highest density of microscopes ever in one place .
We started collecting data about malaria , Chagas disease and Jardy , from the patients themselves .
And finally I want to show you this picture .
I hadn &apos;t seen it before , but it &apos;s a very interesting link between education and science and global health .
What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing for kids to go tomorrow with just monsters ?
I &apos;d really like to be able to print a micro-fold for them that could carry their pockets everywhere .
Thank you .

In our world there are many superheroes .
But they have the worst superpower : invisible .
For example , the catastrophe , workers who collect materials for habitat recycling .
Cataras comes from inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of waste is degraded from the effectiveness of the waste collection system .
Cataras is providing a very vital and affordable work for the whole population , but you don &apos;t know about it .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste recycled .
Most hectares work independently , collect waste from the streets and sell to ghettos in very low prices .
They might gather more than 300 pounds in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and Crosas .
Croses are carts that build wood or metal and are found in some streets in Brazil , just like graffiti and street art .
And so I first met these underestimated superheroes .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist and my art is social , environmental and political artist by nature .
In 2007 , I took my job beyond the walls and into the Casas , as a new urban support for my message .
But at the same time , giving voice to the caduras .
By adding art and humor to purpose , it became more attractive , which helped attract attention to the teduras and improve their self-esteem .
And also , they &apos;re famous now on the streets , on media and on social media .
So the thing is , I dive into this world and I haven &apos;t stopped working since .
I painted over 200 Croses in many cities and I was invited to do exhibitions and tours all over the world .
And then I realized that the hectares , in their invisible , not exclusive just to Brazil .
I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even developed countries like the United States and Japan .
And then I realized that I needed more people to join the goal because it &apos;s a big challenge .
And then , I created a collaborative movement called sprayed my carriage — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crowdfunding event .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So graded my version is a large crowd-funded event to help the cadoras and their Croses .
Cataras gets aid from health professionals and medicine , like family doctors , dentists , leg doctors , hair designers , massists and many more .
But , they also get safety shirts , gloves , glasses rainbags to see the city in high separation , while their Casas are bombarded by incredible volunteers .
And if they also get safety devices : light reflectors , divers and mirrors .
So , finally , voted by street artists and become part of a huge mobile art exhibit .
who upgraded my trailer went to the streets of San Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
But to meet demand in other cities , including outside Brazil , we &apos;ve created PImpX , who has inspired TEDx , and it &apos;s simplified , dared it yourself , that has upgraded my mass funding .
So now everybody can join .
In two years , more than 170 Qataras , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors were involved in a movement that rate my collapse , that their actions were used to teach a cycle in a local school .
So catastrophic leaves the invisible behind and becomes more valued and valuable .
Because of their upgraded Casas , they are able to fight injustice , increase their income and their communication with society .
So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking and acknowledging Qataras and heroes about other invisible in your city .
Try to see the world as one , without borders or schools .
Believe it or not , there are more than 20 million catares in the world .
So the next time you see one , recognize it as an essential part of our society .
Mulu Obrigado , thank you .

About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawner , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 about Virtual Earth brought me here to be the architect of the Being Maps , which is the investment of Microsoft in online mapping .
Over the past two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working very hard to redefine how maps work online .
And we really think about it in other terms entirely of the kind of fancy website and the intention that everybody is used to .
So , the first thing you might notice on the mapping site is just the slices of the angle and the flower , and if you know the Seadragon , that &apos;s its source .
Mapping , of course , is not just about cartography ; it &apos;s about photographic information .
So , as we zoom across a certain level , it becomes something that &apos;s similar to a virtual look at 45 degrees .
You can look at it from all the main directions to show you the three-dimensional structure of the city , all the fronts .
Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment as if there was a painting canvas on which you can present all kinds of applications , and the way you look at the map are really just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the applications that we &apos;ve put , just in the last few months , since we &apos;ve been launched .
So , for example , a few days after the disaster in Haiti , we had a earthquake map that showed before and after air photography .
( Applause ) This wonderful thing that I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking very local blogs in real time and mapping these stories , these values to places that are attributed to them on a blog .
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more cute things .
So , we see , of course , the photographs don &apos;t end up in the air .
These green bubbles represent photostorites that users have created .
I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynthesis is integrated into the map .
All that &apos;s shown in blue is an area where we took photographs from the ground as well .
And then , when you fly down ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down , down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic photograph , the first thing you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a photograph , there &apos;s a 3D understanding of the environment at least as much as there is in the 3D city from the top , so if I click on something to get a closer look at it , then the fact that the transition looks like it looks , is the result of this geometry .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a fun application that we &apos;ve been working on in collaboration with our friends in Flickr .
It takes photos from Flickr with data about geographic location and uses similar processes to Photoshinet to connect these photographs to our photographs , so — I &apos;m not sure if this is the one I really meant to pull out , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourism site , and there are many images in this area and these images taken at different times .
So , this was taken about five .
So , this is the Flickr image , this is our shot .
So you really see how this kind of imagery from a integrated community source , in a very deep way , inside the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are a couple of reasons why it &apos;s interesting and one of them , of course , is a journey in time .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historical pictures that we have here , but there are also some with horses and trains and so on .
But what &apos;s great about this is not only is it the decade of this visual presentation of the world with things that come from users , but it &apos;s also the foundation for an enhanced reality , and it &apos;s something I &apos;ll show you more about in a moment .
Now I just moved into a building . It &apos;s also interesting .
All right , notice there &apos;s a roof right now on us .
We &apos;re in the FeyPlaes market .
And this is something we can do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re not just photographing the street with this camera on the roof of the cars , but we &apos;re also photographing inside .
And from that , we can do the same kind of match not just by the photography of Steps , but also video .
So this is something that we &apos;re going to try now for the first time , in live entertainment , and this is seriously , really , very scary .
( Laughter ) All right .
( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
( Noise ) All right , I &apos;m clicking on this . I click &quot; &quot; activation &quot; &quot; .
I &apos;m live . All right . Here it comes .
So , these are our friends in the Players marketplace , the lab .
( Applause ) So they transmit it live .
All right , George , can you point the camera back to the corner of the market ?
Because I want to show interesting points .
No , no . In the other direction .
Yeah , yeah . Back to the corner . Back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you yet .
All right , OK . Back to the corner . Come back to the corner . Come back to the corner .
All right , forget about that .
What I wanted to show you are these points of interest here on top of the shot because what it allows you is to get a sense of the way , if you &apos;re right at the point — you can think about it — is to take a step further beyond the augmented reality .
What the hell are you — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We do two different things — OK , I &apos;m disconnected now .
We do two different things here .
One of them is to take reality ...
( Laughter ) All right , let me just give a moment to thank the team .
They did a wonderful job to put it together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to leave them now and go back out .
And as I go outside , I &apos;m just going to point out that here , we &apos;re using it for remote presence , but as much as it can be used in its own place , for an augmented reality .
When you use it in place itself , it means that you can bring all this metadata and information about the world — to you .
So here , we take the extra step and transmit it .
It &apos;s broadcast , by the way , on a fourth generation network out of the market .
All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED Talk that Microsoft has spent the last few years .
And this is Curtis Veng , a global telescope .
So , we &apos;re going to go to the garbage grocery where traditional drivers , after a long day in the market , go out to the paragraph , but also watch the sky .
This is the combination of the global telescope into our maps .
( Applause ) It &apos;s time — thank you — it &apos;s the current time , but if we move the time , then we can see what the sky will look like at different times , and we can get all the very detailed information about different times , different dates . Let &apos;s move the moon a little bit higher in the sky , maybe we change the date .
I want to do something like zoom in on the moon .
So , this is an entire astronomical representation of the sky integrated directly into the Earth .
All right now , I &apos;ve lifted my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
Today I &apos;m going to tell you two things . One is what we &apos;ve lost , and the other , how to restore .
Let me start with this .
This is my baseline . This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rocks and lots of sea frogs that like to eat the algae .
That &apos;s about what I saw when I first jumped into the water on the Mediterranean Sea near Spain .
If an alien came to Earth — let &apos;s call it Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe were to dive in a coral reef , this alien would see a lot of things .
It &apos;s unlikely that Joe was a pure coral reef , a Catholic coral reef with lots of corals , sharks , crocodiles , rivers , bears , turtles and so on .
What Joe would probably see was here , in the greener part of the picture .
We have an extreme state here with dead corals , just of bacteria and jellyfish .
And where the diver is , this is now the situation in most reefs in the world , with very few corals , a algae that has grown up on them , lots of bacteria , and after all the big animals disappeared .
And that &apos;s what most marine scientists also saw .
This is their baseline . This is what they think the natural situation is , because we started doing modern science , with diving equipment , long after we started to alleviate marine ecosystems .
So now I &apos;m going to take everyone at a time machine , go to the left and go to the past to see how the sea used to be .
Let &apos;s run the time machine . This is the Line Islands , and there we ran a series of National Geographic expeditions .
This sea is a group of islands that belongs to Kiribati , and it &apos;s rooted on the equator , some islands are not inhabitated , and they &apos;re not engaged in fishing . There are some islands in the margins .
Let &apos;s start at first , Christmas — over 5,000 people .
Most reefs die . Most corals die , the algae grows wild , and most fish are smaller than the pencils that use us to count them .
We &apos;ve spent 250 hours diving here in 2005 .
We didn &apos;t even see one shark .
This is where Captain Coke discovered in 1777 , and he described a huge abundance of sharks who had pulled out the proofs and cops of their little boats when they got on the beach .
Let &apos;s turn the dial back a little bit .
The island of Panning , 2,500 people .
The corals are better here . A lot of little fish .
For many divers , this is heaven .
This you can see in most of the national marine reserve parts in the Florida Islands .
And many people think it &apos;s really , really beautiful , if it &apos;s your baseline .
If we go back in time to a place like Al Flammira , where I visited Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are better off , and there are sharks .
You can see sharks in every single wetsuit .
And this is a very unusual event in the coral reefs today .
But again , if we turn the dial around and go back in 200 or 500 years , we &apos;ll go to places where the corals are completely healthy and wonderful , creating amazing structures , and where the predators are the most controlling thing , and you can see between 25 and 50 sharks at every dive .
What have we learned from these places ?
That &apos;s what we thought to nature .
This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
If we collect and weigh all the fish in a coral reef , that &apos;s what we would expect .
The biomass is low in the food chain , it &apos;s the plant eaters , the beavers , the beekeepers that eat the algae .
On top of them , the plankton eaters , these little blue coral , these little animals floating in the water .
And then we have a smaller biomass of meat eaters , and in a smaller biomass at the top , and these are the sharks , the big predators , the big bears .
But that &apos;s the result .
This view of the world is the result of navigated reefs .
When we got to the cultures , we realized that the natural world behaves upside down ; the pyramid is the opposite .
The pyramid Union is responsible for most biomass , in some places up to 85 percent like Kingman reef , which is now protected .
The good news is that , besides having more predators , there &apos;s more than anything .
The size of these pieces is much longer .
We have more sharks , more biomass of predators , and also more biomass of plant food , like these metal fish , which are like seaweed .
They clean up the reefs from everything that grows and big enough to look , they eat and keep the reef mall and allow corals to regenerate .
Not only is it that these places , ancient places and these worms contain tons of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem , like giant oysters , a floating of giant oysters in lagoon , at about 20 , 25 square meters .
These disappeared from all the non-populated reefs in the world , and they filter the water : they keep water cleaning from bacteria and pathogens .
But we now have global warming .
If there &apos;s no fishing because the law protects these reefs , or because they &apos;re remote , it &apos;s great .
But the water heats up for too long and the corals die .
So how could these fish , how could these predators help ?
Well , what we &apos;ve seen is that in this particular area , at Al Nino time , &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too hot for too long , and many corals were heartled and many of them died .
At Christmas Islands , where very little of the food fabric , and the large animals disappeared , the corals didn &apos;t recover .
On the Panning Islands , the corals didn &apos;t recover .
But here you see a big desk coral that died and collapsed .
And the fish have forgotten the algae , so the growth of the algae is slightly lower .
Now we &apos;re going to move to the atmosphere that has more biomass of plants , and the corals here are clean , and the corals are restoring .
And as you go to the Catholic side , has it ever understood ?
These places were also enjoying , but they quickly recovered .
The less vulnerable it is , the more it is , the more your food chain is complex , the more flexible it is , the more likely the system will recover from the short-term effects of the warming events .
And that &apos;s good news . That &apos;s why we need to reconstruct the structure .
We need to make sure that all the ecological pieces are embedded in place , so that the ecosystem can adapt to global warming effects .
So we need to reset the baseline , if we need to push the ecosystem back to the left , and how can we do that ?
There are some ways .
One of the obvious ways is the protected marine areas , especially the &quot; &quot; don &apos;t spend &quot; &quot; reserves that we &apos;ve closed , to allow the rehabilitation of marine life .
Let me go back to this picture of the Mediterranean Sea .
This was my baseline . This is what I saw as a child .
And then I also watched Jack Cousteau &apos;s programs on television , all of these wealth and abundance and diversity .
And I thought back then that this wealth is in the tropics , and the high seas is inherently thick .
And I really had no idea , until I first dived in a marine reserve .
And this is what I saw : a lot of fish .
After a few years , between five and seven years , the fish come back , eat the sea floor , and the algae grows again .
So at first there are little algae plants , and in the area that &apos;s about a laptop , you can find over 100 species of algae , especially microscopic creatures , hundreds of fish , little animals that feed the fish , so the system can recover .
And this particular place , the Madrid marine reserve , is only 940 acres , and it puts six million Euros into the local economy , 20 times more than the fishing , and these are 88 percent of the income screen from tourism .
So these places help not only the ecosystem , but also the humans who can benefit from the ecosystem .
Let me summarize for you what the word &quot; &quot; don &apos;t take &quot; &quot; teacher .
These places , when we protect them , when we compare them to unprotected areas , that &apos;s what happens .
The number of species is 21 percent . So if you have 1,000 species , you &apos;re likely to have 200 more marine reserves .
It &apos;s a very significant tumor .
The size of the organism increases by one third , so the fish are now this big .
The flu , the amount of fish per square meter , costs almost 170 percent .
And biomass — and this is the most fascinating change of all — 4.5 times more biomass , on average , after just five to seven years .
Some places have 10 times more biomass inside the reserves .
So we have all these things that grow in a reserve , and what do they do ?
They breed . This is the United States of biology .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , it takes them a long time to die , and they grow and they grow very much .
And so are the vertebrates . Here &apos;s an example .
These are the eggs that lay a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is the amount of eggs that they climbed on the bottom .
Outside the reserve , you can &apos;t even notice it .
1.3 million eggs per square meter in the aquatic reserve , where there &apos;s plenty of snails .
So these organisms breed . There &apos;s a bundle of young larvae , there &apos;s a bribe across the borders of the reserve , and humans can benefit from them as well .
This is the Bahamas . This is Ducker Naso .
A huge abundance of pure fish in this reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish there are .
So fishermen catch more .
You can see where the boundaries are , according to the line of boats .
So there &apos;s a bribe here . There are benefits beyond the boundaries that are good for people around , and at the same time , the reserve protects the entire habitat ; it produces resilience .
And what we have now , or in other words , a world without reserves is like a minus account that we are constantly drawn from , and we never focus on it .
The reserves are like savings accounts .
We have a foundation where we don &apos;t touch , and that drives social , economic and ecological attitudes .
And if you think about the increase in biomass in the reserves , it &apos;s a major interest .
Two more examples , how these reserves can be useful for humans .
It &apos;s the amount that fishermen are able to fish every day in Kenya , a fishing that lasted several years , where there &apos;s no protection ; it &apos;s been deployed to everybody .
Once the major decline in the fisheries , they &apos;re not the mines , Sollock , the fishermen have fished more .
If fish are less , they actually get more .
But if you add the &quot; &quot; no exit &quot; &quot; reserve , the fishermen earn even more by fish less around the protected area .
Another example : Depoker was founded in a blues in the eastern American reef .
It &apos;s fish sex . The bees get together when the moon is full of December and January for a week .
They would go to tens of thousands , 30,000 grouper per of this size , about 10 acres in one group .
The fishermen knew about it ; they fished them , and they pushed them .
When I first got there in 2000 , there were only 3,000 fisheries left .
And fishermen were allowed to fish 30 percent of all the population that was run every year .
We did a simple analysis , and you don &apos;t have to be smart enough to understand that if you take 30 percent every year , the fish will disappear very quickly .
And together with it will capture the entire species &apos;s culture ability .
It happened in many places in the Caribbean Sea .
And they &apos;d earn 4,000 dollars a year , just for the entire fishing , a few fishing boats .
If you do economic analysis , and you try to predict what happens if the fishery isn &apos;t destroyed , if we only bring 20 divers for one month a year , the income will be more than 20 times , and over time it will become sustainable .
So how many of this do we actually have ?
If it &apos;s so good and simple , how many of it do we have ?
And you &apos;ve already heard that less than one percent of the ocean is protected .
We &apos;re now approaching one percent because of the protection of the Chagos Islands group , and only a fraction of it is fully protected against fishing .
Scientific studies suggest that at least 20 percent of the sea will be protected .
The common range is between 20 and 50 percent of the series of targets associated with biodiversity and fishing improvement and increased adaptability .
Is it possible ? People ask : How much will it cost ?
Let &apos;s think : How much do we pay now at the fishing secret , 35 billion dollars a year .
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing systems .
There are some estimates about how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas that cover 20 percent of the ocean and it would be just a fraction of what we pay today , volunteers that governments give the branch of fishing collapsed .
People lose their jobs because the fisheries collapse .
Creating a network of reserves will provide direct employment for more than a million people in addition to all the secondary jobs and side benefits .
How do we do that ?
If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are both good for the environment and for humans , why don &apos;t there be 20 , 50 percent of the sea ?
How do we get to that destination ?
There are two ways to get there .
The simple solution is to create very large protected areas like Archipelago Chagos .
The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , there are no social conflicts , and where the political price is low , and also the economic costs .
And some of us , some organizations in this room and other places are working on this .
But what about the rest of the world , where people live or are living fishing ?
There are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of little reserves . The first is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and the fishermen tend to be very protective when it comes to monitoring or closing an area , even a small mother .
Second , there is no administration right because most coastal communities around the world are supporting to monitor the resources to create the reserve and protect it .
It &apos;s a hierarchical and bureaucratic structure , where people are waiting for government officials to come , and it &apos;s not efficient , even government has enough resources .
And that brings us to the third reason . Why don &apos;t we have much more reserves . That &apos;s because the models of finance were wrong .
NGOs and governments spend a lot of time , energy and resources for small , small areas , usually .
So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sewage for governments and donors , and it &apos;s not sustainable .
So the solutions are to fix these three problems .
First , we need to develop a partnership of global awareness that will inspire local communities and governments to make sure that &quot; &quot; don &apos;t spend &quot; &quot; better than those we have now .
It &apos;s savings accounts versus debt accounts without any steel .
Secondly , we need to redesign our governance so that the conservation efforts can be distributed , so the conservation efforts won &apos;t rely on the work of NGOs or government agencies , and they can be done in the local community like in the Philippines and some other places .
And third , and most importantly , we need to develop new business models .
The burning of donations as the only means of creating reserves is not sustainable .
We need to develop models , business models , where coastal preservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
And I want to end with one more thought , which is that no single organization will save the sea .
There was a lot of competition in the past , and we have to develop a new model of partnerships , of real collaboration , where the bodies will complete each other , and they won &apos;t act instead .
The risks are just too high for us to continue the way we go .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you , Enrick .
Anick Sala : Thank you .
CA : It was a thought craftsmanship of connecting the pieces of the puzzle .
First , your pyramid , the opposite pyramid , which shows 85 percent of the biomass of predators , it seems impossible .
How can 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
ES : Well , imagine you have two cockroaches of a clock , one big and one small one .
The big spins very slowly , and the small — fast .
That &apos;s basically the thing .
The animals in the lower parts of the food chain , breed very quickly , grow very quickly and eliminate millions of eggs .
Up , there are big sharks and fish that live 25 , 30 years .
They breed very slowly . Their metabolism is very slow , and in fact they only sustain their biomass .
So basically , the guys &apos; culture preferences down there quite enough to sustain this biomass that &apos;s not in motion .
They &apos;re like receivers in an electric system .
CA : It &apos;s very fascinating .
So actually the picture we have on the food pyramid is just — we have to completely change it .
ES : At least in the sea .
We found that in the coral reefs , the opposite pyramid is equivalent to the Sangti , with five lions per fish .
And on land it can &apos;t work .
But at least the coral reefs are systems that have a structural underground .
We think it &apos;s universal .
But we &apos;ve begun to study comparisons just recently .
CA : The numbers you presented are really amazing .
You say we spend 35 billion dollars on subsidies .
It only takes 16 billion dollars to build 20 percent of the ocean as protected marine areas . It actually gives new choices for fishermen as well .
If the world was smarter , we would solve this problem at 19 billion dollars &apos; savings .
And we got 19 billion dollars to spend on health care and so on .
ES : And we have the low performance problem of fisheries that are under 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the great solutions is that the World Trade Organization will move the subsidies to sustainable systems .
CA : All right . I hear a lot of examples about the madness of the subsidies .
So thank you for those numbers .
And last question , personally .
There &apos;s a lot of experience in the audience here that have been in the oceans for a long time and have seen this decline , the places that were once beautiful about them . It &apos;s depressing .
Tell me about the feelings that you should have when you visited these unborn areas and you saw the things going wrong .
ES : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We went out there to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or map fish and sharks and see what these places are different from the ones that we know .
But the best feeling , is the biophysia that Willson talks about , the sense of instruction and wonder that people are experiencing in the face of inexhaustible nature , the wild nature .
And there , and just there , you feel that you &apos;re really part of something bigger , or part of a global ecosystem .
And for those places that offer some hope , I don &apos;t think I was able to continue my work .
It was just too depressing .
CA : Well , Eric , thank you so much for sharing some of these spiritual experiences . Thank you .
ES : Thank you very much .
Well this year is 1995 , I &apos;m in college , a friend of mine and I go on a road journey from February , Rod Island to Portland , Oregon .
And you know , we &apos;re young and we &apos;re not working , so we &apos;re doing all this in sideways through national parks and forests — basically the longest route you can do .
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that has saved me for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What &apos;s the story with the Chinese sign that I see appears all the time on the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks at me in a completely closed perspective .
There &apos;s actually a man in the front row who makes perfect imitation of her perspective .
( Laughter ) And I say , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs that we see all the time with the Chinese sign that &apos;s on them . &quot; &quot; She stands at me for a while , and then she just jumps off laughter , because she understands what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I talked about was this .
( Laughter ) Yeah , the famous Chinese sign for the Phyacinic region . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years in my life thinking about these kinds of situations exactly — why sometimes we don &apos;t understand the symbols around us , and how we behave when it happens , and what all this can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as you &apos;ve heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being accidental .
It might show you as a strange career to choose , but it actually has one big advantage in it : there are no competition at work .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us are doing everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least avoiding thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
We understand this in a abstract way .
We all know that everyone in this room makes mistakes .
The human species , in general , can accomplish — OK , good .
But when it comes to me right now , all the beliefs that I hold , here in the present time , all of a sudden this abstract appreciation of being able to get out of the window — and I can &apos;t actually think about one thing that I &apos;m driving about .
And the thing is , the present is the time we live .
We go to meetings in the present time , we go on family vacations in the present time . We go to the ballot and vote in the present time .
So in fact , in a way we all go through our lives , locked in a small bubble where we feel right about everything .
I think that &apos;s a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our private and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us together as a culture .
So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we &apos;re stuck in this sense of being right .
Second , why is it such a problem ?
And finally , I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to come out of this sense , and that if you can do that , it &apos;s the greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can do .
So why do we get stuck in this sense that we &apos;re right ?
One reason has to do with the feeling of being mistaken .
So a company let me ask you something — or actually , let me ask you something , because you &apos;re right here : what &apos;s the feeling — emotional — how does it feel wrong ?
Horrible . Failure .
embarrassing . Okay , great , good .
Horrible , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but these are answers to a different question .
You guys have answered the question : How does it feel when you realize you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) The realization that we &apos;re wrong may feel like this and many other things , right ?
I mean it might be destructive , it might be an epiphany , it might be funny , like my stupid Chinese symbol mistake .
But just by accident doesn &apos;t make any sense .
I &apos;m going to show you an analogy .
Do you remember the cartoon character of the pathetic concert that &apos;s always chasing but never catching the bird ?
Less or less in each episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment when the diameter chases the bird and the bird runs over the cliff , and it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s a bird , it can fly .
But the thing is this , the nightmare runs beyond the cliff right after the bird .
And what &apos;s funny — at least when you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote is also fine .
He just keeps running — right up to the moment he looks down and realizes he depends on the air .
So it falls .
When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we understand it , but before — we &apos;re like the same cocktail after the end of the cliff and before the comet is down .
You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on a solid ground .
So I have to actually fix something I said a moment ago .
We do have a feeling when we &apos;re wrong : the feeling is that we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s one reason , structural reason , why we &apos;re stuck in the feeling that we &apos;re right .
I call it wrong blindness .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inner marker to know us that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s also a second reason why we get stuck in this feeling — and this one is cultural .
Think for a moment about the past in primary school .
You &apos;re sitting in a classroom , and your teacher &apos;s holding a test page , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
( Laughter ) So here you are in primary school , and you know exactly what to think about the child who got this test .
This is the stupid kid , who gets in trouble , is that we never make the homework .
So by the time you arrived at 9 , you already learned , first of all , that people who make mistakes are lazy , irresponsible — and second , the way to succeed in life is never to achieve .
We learn these bad lessons really well .
And many of us — and I have a suspicion , that many of us in this room — are just dealing with them by making them great , practical , psychological students .
Right , the CEO masters , the astrophysicist , the ultramarathon ran ?
( Laughter ) It turns out that all of you are CEOs , astrophysicists , ultramarathons .
Okay , so okay .
Except that we get off the awards from the possibility that we &apos;ve been wrong with something .
Because according to that , mistaking something means something wrong with us .
So we &apos;re just standing on that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel intelligent , responsible and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A few years ago , a woman went into a woman &apos;s surgery at the University of Israel Medical Center .
Israel &apos;s house in Boston .
This is Harvard Medical School — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken to the operating room .
She &apos;s commonplace , the surgeon does his own — knock her back , send her to the recovery room .
It seems like everything was fine .
When she wakes up and she looks down on herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body wearing ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body was wearing because the surgeon did a significant operation on her left leg rather than on the right .
When the President &apos;s Medicine of Medicine of Medicine in Israel talked about this incident , he said a very interesting thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; For some reason , the surgeon just felt that he was on the right side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point in this story is that confidence is too much in the sense that we are on the right side of everything might be very dangerous .
The sense of intrinsic justice in which we all experience so often is not a way to relieve what &apos;s actually going on in the outside world .
And when we drive like it is , and we stop thinking we might be wrong , well then we find ourselves doing things like spilling 750 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or bother the global economy .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
That means that you think your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
And when you feel like this , you have a problem to solve , which is , how do you explain all those people who disagree with you ?
It turns out , most of us explain these people in a similar way , using a series of miserable assumptions .
The first thing we usually do when someone doesn &apos;t agree with us is just assume it &apos;s broken .
It doesn &apos;t have access to the same information that we have , and when we generously share this information , it will see the light and move to our side .
When it doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that those people have all the same facts that we have and they still don &apos;t agree with us , we go to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re stupid .
( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces in the puzzle , but they &apos;re too scared to paint them right .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us hold all the facts and actually are quite intelligent , we go to a third assumption : they know the truth , and deliberately they distort it for their malicious purposes .
So this is a disaster .
Our attachment stops us from stopping mistakes when we absolutely have to do it and makes us treat each other horribly .
But for me what &apos;s most confusing and most tragic about this is that it misses the main point of being human .
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our consciousness is just a perfect transparent window and we &apos;re just looking through it and describing the world when it &apos;s discovered .
And we want everybody else to look through the same window and see the same thing .
It &apos;s not real , and if it was , life was incredibly boring .
The miracle of our consciousness is not that we see the world as it is .
But we see the world as we don &apos;t .
We remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be another person somewhere else .
And we all do it a little differently , and that &apos;s why we can look up to that night skyrocket and see it as well as that .
And yes , it &apos;s also why we &apos;re wrong .
1,200 years before Deckart said his famous book about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I exist , &quot; &quot; this guy , the Holy Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallmer Argo &quot; &quot; — &quot; I &apos;m wrong that I am . &quot;
Augustine realized that our ability to cook , is not a kind of embarrassing flaw in the human method , something that can be eradicated or overcome .
It &apos;s absolutely fundamental to who we are .
Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
And unlike all other animals , we &apos;re chased by trying to find out .
For me , this persecution is the source and roots of all our productivity and our creativity .
Last year , for a number of reasons , I found myself listening to many chapters of the American Public Live Program .
And so I listened and listened and at some point , I started to feel like all the stories were about misconstruing .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m missing a screw .
I became the crazy mistake lady .
I just imagined it everywhere . &quot; &quot; What really happened .
But a few months later , I had the opportunity to interview Aira Glass , the program host .
And I mentioned this in front of him , and he said , &quot; No , that &apos;s the truth . &quot;
In fact , he says , &quot; &quot; As a team we make sure that every chapter of our program has the same hidden subject .
The invisible issue is : I thought it was what was going to happen and instead it happened something else , and the point is , &quot; &quot; Aira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need it .
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and error to make the stories work . &quot; &quot; And for us , the friends in the audience , as listeners , as readers , we absorb this material .
We like things like complications in the delicious night and surprising threats .
When it comes to our stories , we like to make mistakes .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think one thing is going to happen and instead it happens something else .
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a stack of weapons for mass destruction , release the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened in place .
And Hosni Mubarak thought he would be a single ruler in Egypt for the rest of his life , until he would become too old or too sick and be able to pass the ruler to his son .
And something else happened in place .
And maybe you thought you &apos;d grow up and get married with your father from high school and come back to your hometown and grow kids together .
And something else happened in place .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an unbelievably nerdy book about a topic that everybody hates for an audience that would never really happen .
And something else happened in place .
( Laughter ) I mean , it &apos;s life .
For better and worse , we make these stories that we won &apos;t believe about the world around us , and then the world rotates around and amazes us .
Without enthusiasm , this whole conference is an unbelievable memorial for our ability to make mistakes .
We just finished spending a whole week talking about innovation , developments and improvements , but you know why we need all these developmental and improvable innovations ?
Because half of the most thoughtful and world-changing things — TED 1998 — ah .
( Laughter ) They didn &apos;t work right , right . ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my Chinese backpack Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So here we are again here .
And this is how it happens .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We &apos;re doing another conference .
The theme of this , as you &apos;ve heard , seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
And for me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you have to go out of the tiny , frightened place of being right and looking around each other and looking at the vast size of complexity and mystery of the universe and being able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On November 5 , 1990 , a man named Al Saudi Newser walked into the hotel in Manhattan and murdered Herbie Mir as a president , the head of the League for Jewish defense .
First , Newser is not guilty of murder , but as he speaks about open transfers , he and other people started planning assaults on a dozen targets in New York City , including tunnels , conferences and the United Nations headquarters .
Luckily , these programs were aggregated by the FBI informant .
Unfortunately , the explosion in 1993 of the World Trade Center wasn &apos;t sugar .
He was finally convicted of his engagement in the flow .
Al Snowden is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 , a father , a Egyptian engineer , and if an American loves and a teacher in elementary school , who together tried as much as you could make me happy childhood .
It wasn &apos;t until you were seven that my family dynamic started to change .
My father exposed me alongside Islam that a few people , including most Muslims , go to see .
It was my experience that when people take the time to communicate with each other , it doesn &apos;t take a long time to realize that often , we all want the same things in life .
However , in every religion , in every population , you will find a small percentage of people holding their beliefs so powerful that they feel that they have to use any possible way to make others live like them .
A few months before his arrested , he sat down and explained that for the last couple of weeks , he and some friends went to the Long Island range for bullet training .
He told me I would walk with him the next morning .
We got to Clauretton range , unknownst of our group was under the FBI surveillance .
When my parents came to fire , my father helped me hold the gun on my shoulder and explained to me how to target a target about 30 meters away .
That day , the last ball that I shot hit a little orange light that sat on the target and surprise everyone , especially mine , the whole goal hit the flames .
My uncle turned to the other people , and he said in Arabic , &quot; &quot; Ivan Abu . &quot; &quot; The son like his father .
Everybody was very funny about this comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years ago that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
They thought they saw the same destruction that my father was able to do .
These people eventually were convicted of bringing a van full of 500 pounds of explosive material into the lower parking lot in the northern World Trade Center , which caused a explosion that killed six people and injured 1,000 others .
These were the people I had for the model .
These were the people I read his mother , who meant David .
By the time I arrived at 19 , I had been through apartments for 20 times in my life , and the instability in my childhood was not really providing me with the opportunity to connect a lot .
Every time I started to feel comfortable with someone , it &apos;s time for me to package and move to the next city .
Being the permanent new face in the classroom , I &apos;ve often been the target for the bullies .
I kept my identity secret from my classmates to avoid becoming a target , but it turns out , being the silent , fat and the new kid in class was more than a ammunition producer .
So most of the time , I spent my house reading books and seeing TV or playing video games .
For these reasons , my social skills are missing , to be gentle , and to grow up in an untolerant house for others , I was not ready for the real world .
I was raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like the race or the religion of a person .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challenged this mindset was during the 2000 presidential election .
Through a college preparation group , I could take part of the National Gouth Conference in Philadelphia .
My particular group focused on youth violence , and as a victim for bullying for most of my life , it was a subject that I had a strong passion for .
Our friends in our group came from all walks of life .
One day towards the end of the conference , I found that one of the kids I connected with was Jewish .
Now , it took a few days for this piece to get exposed , and I realized that there was no natural hostility among us .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and I actually had a sense of pride in being able to get through the barrier that most of my life had made me believe that I was unparable .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job in Bush Gardens , a amusement park .
There , I was exposed to people from all the beliefs and cultures , and this experience proved to be meaningful to the development of my character .
Most of my life , I was taught that homosexuality was a sin , and through that , all gay people had a negative impact .
I happened to have an opportunity to work with some proud performers in the show there , and I soon found that many of them were the nicest people , and the least judgments I &apos;ve ever met .
To experience ideas as a child made a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others , and it came to me very unnatural to treat nice people in a different way than the way I &apos;d like them to join me .
Because of this feeling , I was able to resist stereotypes that taught me as a child with experience and interaction of real life .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be homosexual , but I really know the sense of being judged by something beyond your control .
So it came the &quot; &quot; Dilly Shoo . &quot; &quot; On a daily basis , John Stewart forced me to be an intellectual honest with myself about my racism and helped me understand that the race of a man , religion or sexual bias wasn &apos;t about the personality of the person .
He was in many ways a painful figure for me when I was desperate for one .
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian has made more impact on my view of the positive world than my extreme father has not gone without attention .
One day , I had a conversation with my mom about how my worldview started to change and she told me something that I would hold close to my heart as long as I live .
She looked at me in the tired eyes of someone who had suffered enough dogmatism for a whole life , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside you .
Zack Ibrahim is not the real sky .
I changed it when my family decided to end up in contact with my father and start a new life .
So why would I reveal myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I do it hopefully that maybe someone one day who feels a need to use violence might hear my story and realize that there &apos;s a better way , that even though I was given to this violent and untolerant ideology , that I didn &apos;t become a feminist .
Instead , I chose to use my attempt to heat terrorism , to fight impatience .
I do this for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , to the horrible pain and loss that terrorism imposed on their lives .
For the terrorist attacks , I &apos;m going to talk against these irrational actions and protect my father &apos;s actions .
And with this simple fact , I &apos;m standing here as evidence that violence is not rooted by religion or somebody &apos;s race , and that the son doesn &apos;t have to walk in his father &apos;s way .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , all of you . ( Applause ) Thank you everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m happy to be here .
And thank you for being invited . Thank you .
I &apos;d love to talk about the things that are interesting to me , but unfortunately I &apos;m afraid that what interests me is not going to be interested in many others .
First , my brand says I &apos;m an astronomer .
I &apos;d love to talk about my astronomy , but I &apos;m afraid that the number of people who are interested in radiation transit in unmetaphorical atmospheres and the manipulation of light in the upper atmosphere of Yuperter is similar to a number of people who can go inside a bus stop .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
( Laughter ) It would be just as fun to talk about all the things that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when hackers hacked our systems at Lawrence Berkeley Lab .
And when I caught them it turned out that they were working for what was then the Soviet C.D. , and that they were stealing information and selling it .
So I &apos;d love to talk about it , and it would also be fun , but , after 20 years ...
I find computer security , actually , quite boring .
It &apos;s crazy .
I — for the first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second time , this is engineering .
The third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . After doing something , I do something else .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that either .
And it &apos;s not about what I think are the statements built out of the first book of Silicon oil snake , or the second book , and I &apos;m not going to talk about why I think schools don &apos;t have to be computers .
I feel that there &apos;s a huge , bizarre idea that goes by that we need to put more computers into schools .
My idea is : No ! No !
Take them out of schools , and leave them away from schools .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , but I think the argument is so clear to anyone who has turned around in a classroom room so you don &apos;t have to talk about it much , although I guess I might be very wrong about it , and all the other things I &apos;ve said .
So don &apos;t go back and read my thesis .
There &apos;s probably all kinds of lies as well .
So after I said this , I built the tenets of my talk about five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) If you look at it here , the main thing I wrote about my toe is the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , right ?
Oh , right . My feeling is that asking me to talk about the future is weird , because I have a hairs of thinking , so it &apos;s a little silly that I &apos;m going to talk about the future .
In fact , I think if you really want to know what &apos;s going to be in the future , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist or a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask someone writing code .
No , if you want to know what the company will look like in 20 years , ask a gardener .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t just ask a gardener , ask a trying gardener .
They &apos;re the ones who know what society will look like in another generation .
I — no . And no , I &apos;m afraid , many other people who talk about what the future will be .
Of course , we can all imagine the cool new things that will be here .
But for me , things are not the future .
When I ask myself , what would the company look like , when the kids today are amazingly good at sending text messages and spending a lot of time in front of a screen , but they never went to Boling together .
Changing happens , and the change that happens is not software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , and it was fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing today . What am I doing today ?
Oh , the second thing I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right here . Right here .
Can you see ? I want to talk about one-sided things .
What I &apos;d really like to talk about is things that have one side .
Because I love Mubius loops , not only do I like Mubius loops , I &apos;m also one of the very few people , if not the only people in the world , who makes Coke Coke .
Right away , I hope that all of you will fade .
This is a bottle of music .
Those of you in the audience who know this , you roll your eyes up and say , yes , I know everything about it .
It only has one side . It &apos;s a bottle whose face is also his arrow .
It &apos;s got zero volume . And it &apos;s not directable .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two Mubius loops and sew their common tip together , you get one of these . I make them glass .
And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , just that I don &apos;t have too much — what to say is — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Annson : Anyway , the TEDster at TED is a design presentation , of course .
Just two weeks ago , I made — you know , I made little , mediocre , medium , big bottles for the conference .
But what I just prepared — and I &apos;m happy to show you , for the first time in public .
This is a bottle of California that &apos;s also a bottle of wine , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to contain fluids at all , it &apos;s certainly able to do that because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
And because our universe only has three spatial dimensions , it can contain fluids .
And so , that &apos;s the cool thing .
It was a month of my life .
But even though I &apos;d love to talk to you about topology , I &apos;m not going to do that .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mother , who passed out last summer .
She collected pictures of me , as mothers do .
Can anybody project this guy ?
And I looked at her album and she kept a picture of me standing there , more right sitting in front of a pile of dials .
And I looked at this and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; Oh , this was taken when I worked in the electronic music studio !
As a technician , you maintain the electronic music studio at the University of New York in Bopalo . Wow !
The &quot; &quot; time machine &quot; &quot; — and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah !
And that sent me back ...
Soon after that , I found another picture of me that she kept .
This guy is me , of course .
And this man is Robert Mug , the leader &apos;s synthesizer inventor , who died in the last August .
Robert Mugg was a very good and generous and engineer who was incredibly capable .
A musician who spent time teaching me , a first-year student at the University of New York in Bopalo .
He would come from Toronto burg to teach me not only about the synthesizer of a brand , but we would sit there — I learned physics at the time . 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We learn physics , I study physics , and then he says , &quot; It &apos;s a good thing to do . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t touch electronic music if you learn physics . &quot; &quot; He used to educate me . He would come and spend hours with me .
He wrote me a letter to the recommendation of continuing learning .
In the background , my bike .
Now I realize that this picture was taken in a friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Mug came in and raised a whole bunch of equipment to show Grand Princeton and I have all kinds of things about it .
We sat down and talked about fertile conversion , basket functions , conversion functions , things like this .
Bob Summer &apos;s patriarchy was a sympathy for all of us .
Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been deeply influenced by Robert Mug .
( Applause ) Just say what I &apos;m going to do . What I &apos;m going to do — I hope you &apos;ve recognized that there &apos;s a dead sine wave , a wave almost triangled in this HP oscope .
Cool . I can get to this place here , right ?
Children . Children are what I want to talk about — that &apos;s okay ?
It says kids here , that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
I decided , at least for me , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
So I think local and local .
I feel that the best way to help something is to help locally , very local .
So a Ph.D. here , and a degree there and a friend of mine .
I talked about these clouds with some teachers about a year ago .
And one of them , actually some of them came to me and said , &quot; How is it that you don &apos;t teach ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; I went to graduate school , I went to graduate school . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , if you &apos;re so loving kids and all these things , how is it that you &apos;re not there in the front ?
Your actions will match your bees . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s true . Right . I teach science to classrooms at four days a week .
It doesn &apos;t just appear here and there .
No , no , no . I show presence .
I come to lunch shows . ( Applause ) It &apos;s not , no , it &apos;s not a matter of applause .
I highly recommend each of you to do something like this .
Not only to come to one class or another .
Teach , a whole week . Well , I &apos;m in three quarters of a job , but that &apos;s good enough .
One of the things I did with my science students is to tell them , &quot; I &apos;m going to teach you physics at a college level . &quot;
Without calculus , that &apos;s what I cut .
You don &apos;t need to know trigo .
But you have to know a fifth grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
Without all the opening up a seven-year-old chapter and solving all the problems of the island of Zoo .
There &apos;s going to be real physics . And this is one of the things I thought we &apos;d do right now .
( Higher sound ) Oh , before I turn it on , one of the things we did three weeks ago in the classroom — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used in the lens is measure the speed of light .
My students at Al Sarto , of course , and using a very old punch osteoscope , measured the speed of light .
We missed 20 and five percent . How many classmates do you know that measured the speed of light ?
In addition , we measured the speed of sound .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
I was already ready to do that , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to challenge the power of power , and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m already organized to do that , organized to do it , but then it turns out that to organize here , you only have 10 minutes to prepare !
And there &apos;s not enough time to do that .
So next time , maybe , embrace the speed of light !
But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
Well the obvious way of measuring the speed of sound is to get the voice over something and test the echo .
But probably — after my students , Ariel , said , &quot; Can we measure the speed of light using the wheel equation ? &quot;
You all know what the wheel equation is : double the length of the wave of any wave ...
It &apos;s constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelengths go down . As the wavelengths go up , the frequency goes down . So if we have a wave here — here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — when the peak is higher , things are closer , when the peak is lower , everything is stretched .
Right ? It &apos;s a simple physics .
You all know it from sixth grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics classes , in the physics of the eighth grade , but they had to , and I wish they would do that , is that if you double the frequency of the sound or of light , you get a constant .
And this constant will be the speed of sound .
So to measure the speed of sound , all I need to do is know the frequency . Well , it &apos;s easy .
I have a frequency dimension here .
We &apos;re going to feed it to A more or less .
Now , so I know the frequency .
This is 1.76 kilohertz . I measure the length of the wave .
All I need to do is turn on another fund , the bottom one is I &apos;m talking , right ?
So every time I talk you &apos;ll see it on the screen .
I &apos;ll put it here , and when I move it from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
The motions like Salinky . We go through different nodes of the wave , come out of here .
I hear the physicists between you rolling their eyes , but give me a moment . ( Laughter ) To measure the length of the wave , all I need to do is measure the distance from here , full wavelength , to here .
From here to here , this is the wavelength of the voice .
So we put a tape here and here , and then we move back here .
I moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to 20 centimeters .
Okay , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Emmo again .
And let &apos;s say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 hertz .
The wavelength is 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s consider what comes out .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 meters is 352 meters per second .
And if you look at the books , it &apos;s actually 343 .
But here with steeped equipment , and a shuffled drink , we were able to measure the speed of sound exactly — not bad . Pretty good .
All of this joins what I wanted to say .
Go back to my picture about a million years ago .
This year is 1971 , the Vietnam War continues , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I study physics — to the video , Lischwitz Rosek and Nolly .
I go home for a semi-semi-semi-semi-Smith , there are riots in campus .
There &apos;s an outbreak ! Hey , go away .
There &apos;s a hitting on campus , and the police chase me , right ?
I walk campus , a police officer comes to me , looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Take a gun out . Boom !
And a gas square the size of a Pepsi can fly by my head . Whoosh !
I breathe a little bit of hydrogen gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
The officer chases me with a gun .
He wants to hit me in his head !
I say , &quot; &quot; I have to fly away ! &quot; &quot; I run and cross the campus as quickly as I could . I &apos;m going into the hall hall .
This is one of those guys with a towel tower .
And the police chase me .
Rover after the first floor , second floor , third floor .
Inside a room .
The entrance room for the tower tower .
I throw the door behind me , climb up , I go through where I see the pendulum swinging .
And I think , oh yeah , the fourth root of a proportional length for the fluctuation . ( Laughter ) I keep climbing , repeat .
You go to a place where some movement is split .
There &apos;s a click noise , a click , a click click .
Time goes back because I &apos;m in it .
I think of the intention of Lornz and Einstein &apos;s relativity .
I climb up , and then there &apos;s a place , right behind , where you can climb a tree ladder .
Bring up the hood , and there &apos;s a dome .
One of these domes is three meters old .
I look out and I see the cops forcing students , shooting gas from drowning , and students throwing white .
And I ask myself , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? And then I remembered something that my high school English teacher said .
When you make toes , you make a written on them .
So I wipe the three pigeon over one of the columns , and I look at it .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , now the time I &apos;m going to tell you what was the butter there on the bell in the Fahrenheed Tower on the Heiz . &quot; &quot; All the truths are one .
In this light , if science and religion are going to come up here on the steady development of humanity , darkness to light , curved Egyptians across horizons , prejudice science for tolerance .
The voice of life , call us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
Well , I had a lot of time thinking in those eight hours without sleep .
It sounds healthy sense , and that &apos;s exactly what it is , but it &apos;s ridiculous in a lot of science , based on how our spatial memory works .
The bottom is the number to treat .
But actually , medicine doesn &apos;t work that way .
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
They took the tag away from me , but I wanted to ask you , did any of you write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
Anybody ? No one ? Well , no problem .
Not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with a friend and I wanted to invite .
I turned to the courtyard and I said , &quot; Is there a menu ? &quot;
He looked at me staring at me like he didn &apos;t hear good .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re the menu , please . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Do you not know what you call it ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; Is the French expression accurate ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , take care of her ! &quot; &quot; The waiter said .
He stood up when he talked to me , as if he said to himself , &quot; Even if it was the last girl in the world , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
What does it mean to say &quot; &quot; meno &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Two words made a young white man judge a girl as if she was outdated and bee .
How could she talk like this ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It freaked me crazy .
It must be painful !
I was privileged to speak in my own language in my country ?
Where else is this happening ?
How did we get there ?
As we are here , there are many people like me who will come to a stage in their lives , where they will note that they don &apos;t want to do anything they have happened to them , just so they can say they &apos;re modern and insisted .
Should I forget all my culture , my thoughts , my wisdom and all my memories ?
The stories of childhood may be the most beautiful memories of war !
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to stand in conflict ?
To be one of them ?
Where is the logic of all of this ?
However , I tried to understand .
I didn &apos;t want to judge it in the same hardware that he judged me .
Arabic language is not enough for today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language that &apos;s used to at universities , a language that &apos;s used in the workplace , a language that &apos;s supported when you do advanced research , and certainly not a language that you use at airport .
If we did that , we would be judged by our own clothes .
Where can I use it ? We can all ask this question !
You want us to use Arabic . Where can we do that ?
This is one reality .
But there &apos;s another reality , more important that we have to think about .
Arabic is the native language .
Research says that control in other languages requires control of the mother &apos;s language .
Mother &apos;s language control is an early condition for creative expression in other languages .
How about that ?
Jabran wiped out Jibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
All of his ideas , his imaginations and philosophy were inspired by the little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling some smell , listening to a particular voice , and thinking about certain thoughts .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough charge .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writing in English , you smell the same smell , you feel the same feeling .
You can feel that it is the one who writes in English , the same kid who came from the mountains , a village on Her-Lebanon .
This is an example that you can &apos;t argue about .
Usually they say that if you want to eliminate a nation , the only way to eliminate disease is by eliminating mutilation .
It &apos;s a reality that the developed companies are aware of .
The Germans , the French , the Japanese and the Chinese , are all aware of it .
So they legislate laws to keep their language safe .
They make it sacred .
So they use it creativity , they spend a lot of money to develop .
Are we smarter than them ?
Well , we don &apos;t belong to the developed world , the developed things haven &apos;t yet come to us , and we &apos;d like to close the gap from the advanced world .
The countries that used to be like us , but they decided to strive towards development , do research , and close the gap with developed countries , like Turkey , Malaysia and so on , they carried their language while they climbed up the ladder , kept it as if there was a diamond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you see any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not written in Turkey , it &apos;s not local product .
They won &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They will come back to just consumers , consumers who have no idea , as we are most of the time .
So , so that they could invent and produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; what does that tell you ?
It &apos;s not a familiar shadow , right ?
Regardless of who , how and why .
Language is not just for talking , it &apos;s not just words coming out of the mouth .
Language represents defined steps in our lives , and conveniences associated with our emotions .
So when I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each of you draw a particular image in your mind , certain emotions form on a particular day in a particular historical period .
Language is not just one , two or three words connected to each other .
It &apos;s the idea that inside , it &apos;s about how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our intellect ?
When do we know that one person understood or not ?
If I say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , or if your son comes up and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived in a period of freedom passwords ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem here , I &apos;d better stop talking to the Holocaust and leave .
The thing is that these phrases remind us of certain things .
I have a French speaker company married to a French man .
I used to ask her what she was interested in .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all right , but one time I tried to translate to him for a whole night the word &quot; &quot; totototobni . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The danger , we &apos;ll take her tobacco bourni , and then spend a whole night trying to explain to him .
He was wondering how could someone be so caring ?
Would you like to lose ?
&apos;Get me killed ? &apos; This is one of the examples .
It made us feel that she couldn &apos;t say this word to her husband , because he wouldn &apos;t understand , and Jupiter wouldn &apos;t understand ; his form of thinking is different .
She told me , &quot; &quot; He listened to me to Paris , and one night , I tried to translate to him so that he could sense what I feel when I listen to Paris . &quot; &quot; The danger tried to translate it to him : &quot; I &apos;ve shaved my hands and stole you from them — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the punchline : &quot; And because you belong to them , I &apos;ve left my hands back and made you . &quot; ( Laughter )
Translate it to me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to keep the Arab language ?
We &apos;ve made it a matter of civil society and we &apos;ve launched a campaign to preserve Arabic language .
Although people told me , &quot; &quot; What are you for ?
You give up your head pain and enjoy your life . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign for conservation in Arabic created a password that says , &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you from the east , but you &apos;ll answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say we didn &apos;t want to get this thing or another . We didn &apos;t adopt this kind of style because then we wouldn &apos;t understand us .
And when someone talks to me like this , I hate Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be safe in the way that reflects our dreams , our aspirations and our ordinary lives .
Sure how we dress up and think .
So , &quot; I &apos;ll talk to you from the east , but you answer the West , &quot; &quot; swallow the target .
Something very simple , but creative and compelling .
Then , we launched another propaganda journey with mirrors of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example of this outside , a mirror of a letter surrounded by a yellow film with the writings , &quot; Don &apos;t wash your language ! &quot;
Now seriously , why not eliminate your language ?
We do not have to eliminate our language .
If we were to eliminate language , we would have to look for identity .
We had to look for existence .
We had to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s beyond just missing our opportunity to be modern and insisted .
We then published images of men and women wearing the Arab letters .
Pictures of men and women are cool .
We &apos;re very cool !
And for those who might say , &quot; &quot; Here , you used the word English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I embrace the word &apos; cool . &quot; &quot; They let them stretch as much as they want , but show me a word that is more beautiful and more adaptable to reality .
I &apos;m going to keep saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going into a global network . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not right ! We don &apos;t have to complete ourselves .
But to get to this point , we should all be convinced that we should not afford anyone who is stronger or who thinks has some suggestions about language , control us or make us think and feel what they want .
The idea is creativity .
If we can &apos;t reach space or build space , etc . , we can be creative .
Right now , every one of you is a creative project .
Creativity , in your native language , is the way .
Let &apos;s start from that moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or make a short movie .
One novel can make us global again .
It can bring back Arabic language to be number one .
So it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we need to know it and be convinced that the solution exists , and that we need to be part of the same solution .
Finally , what can we do today ?
Twitter , who tweets now ?
Please , I &apos;m begging , even though my time is over , no matter whether it &apos;s Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t type Arabic in the audacious letters involved with literature !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a big trouble ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from that place and get up .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re here today not to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to pay attention to preserving language .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
A baby first identifies his father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m going to tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , Yakirk . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say to her , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , I will choose &#91; English &#93; . &quot; &quot; And on a supermarket , I assure that the violin , if she tells me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . ( Arabic ) &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , man , &apos; and nobody heard it .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s free of this cultural revelation . ( Applause )
Sustainability represents the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; , the &quot; &quot; where &quot; &quot; how &quot; &quot; of what we &apos;re going to discuss .
And the &quot; &quot; who &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; are the important to me .
I want to know the people behind my food choices .
I want to know how I affect them .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they &apos;re fish .
I want to know how they rely on the abundance in the water for their livelihood .
The understanding of all of these allows us to change our notion of the seafood from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows us to respect the seafood that &apos;s better for us to fail .
So how should we call it ?
I think we &apos;ll call them livestock .
If sustainability is the ability to negotiate , rehabilitation is the ability to innovate full and progress .
Lockpipes allow us to sustain an evolving and dynamic system and recognize our relationship with the sea as a resource , where the idea is that we will engage in ocean regeneration and foster its resilience .
It has much more hope , much more human and much more useful , as a way of understanding our environment .
Spocket guides — which produce many in the marine conservation world — are very useful , they &apos;re a great tool .
Green lists , yellow and red lists of seafood .
It &apos;s easy to do the link : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about everything yellow .
But I think it &apos;s certainly not enough to eat from the green list .
We can &apos;t achieve sustainability without measuring our success to make a real difference in the fate of yellow and red species .
But what if we just eat from the green list ?
Here &apos;s a yellowfin tuna that &apos;s been shown in the dark — originated in sustainable stores .
Dialogue in the dark — there &apos;s no side delay .
It &apos;s good for fishermen . A lot of money , supporting local economies .
But it &apos;s an aquatic lion . It &apos;s a predator .
What is the context of this meal ?
Am I sitting in the steak to eat half a kilograms of that ?
Do I do that three times a week ?
Maybe I &apos;m still on the green list , but I &apos;m not very good at myself , or you , or with the sea .
The point is that we need to have context , a measure of our actions in all of this .
An example : I heard a great red wine for my health — antioxidation and minerals — healthy for the heart .
Great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;ll make a lot of it . I &apos;ll be so healthy .
So after a few bottles announced that I had a problem ?
Guys , we have a protein problem .
We &apos;ve lost that diagnosis capacity for our food , and we pay for it a price .
The problem is that we hide the price below the waves .
We hide the price behind social agreement to transcend the line .
And we hide the price behind huge profits .
And so the first thing about the idea of seafood is to really consider our needs .
The best representation of seafood is not in &quot; &quot; Jaws &quot; &quot; movies or &quot; &quot; Florida &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; The Gordon of Diague , &quot; &quot; but in &quot; &quot; The Incredible Incredible Hulk &quot; &quot; products .
Young : They may still save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
So with respect , I want to determine that the green of the broccoli may be the new blue .
We need to keep eating the best of the seafood , if anything .
But we also have to occupy tons of vegetables .
But the best part of drinking water is that they come on a shell with a bottle of Tesco and Limon pets .
Or a 150 grain palm palm fish coated in the gardens of Dahn and the calories of bread alongside a pile of Falfin Pac-Kinka and bell broccoli and soft , sweet , shy and smoke out of the outside with a cowboy in Chile .
Hooo !
It will go fast .
And the best part is that all of these components are available to every family in the neighborhood supermarket .
Jamie Oliver runs a propaganda to save America from our eating drivers .
Sylvia runs a propaganda for saving the oceans from our eating drivers .
There &apos;s a certain pattern here .
Leave the nuclear Holocaust ; the skim is that we have to worry about .
We &apos;ve wasted the world and used the food that we produced to lay itself down in a few ways .
I think the whole eating thing is wrong with us .
So I think it &apos;s time for us to change our expectations from our food .
Sustainability is a complex issue , but meal is a reality that we can all understand very well .
So let &apos;s start with this .
There are many recent movements for moving to green food systems .
Dan Barber and Alice Walters are passionately leading the &quot; &quot; Green Revolution &quot; &quot; of Green Food .
But green foods often represent a way that allows us to ignore our responsibility as eating .
The fact that it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t allow us to crawl in the food in the dish .
We have an environmentally friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have the technology .
But we &apos;ll never have an environmentally friendly shrimp buffer .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
A pancreatic meal is an important ingredient in the reflective seafood .
While we &apos;re dealing with the Millennium Sea population , the media is recommending to consume more seafood .
According to the studies , tens of thousands of grandmothers , grandparents , mothers and American fathers will get to celebrate another birthday if we eat more seafood .
On this prize I &apos;m not willing to give up .
But it &apos;s not just about foods here .
It &apos;s how we see our success .
As a chef , I know the easiest thing for me is to minimize the daughters I &apos;ve taken .
And then a few things will happen .
I &apos;ll make more money .
People will start inviting suicide and salad , because they &apos;ll realize that they can &apos;t be filled with the primary dose alone .
People will spend a lot more time dealing with lunch , in personal communication during lunch .
In short , people will get more than they want to get , even though they got less proteins .
They got more calories during a diverse meal .
They got healthier . I earned more .
It &apos;s great .
The environmental consideration was served in every dish , but it was rewarded at the same time as a huge pile of consideration in the human interest .
One of the other things that we did was we started to divert the species that we serve — we normally served silver fish , antennae , refrigerators and little crabs .
Mossip , tribes , oysters , condoms , geeks , chief — these were the normal species .
We set the flavor senses towards the resilient and healthier possibilities .
Those should be better .
That &apos;s what it says on the green list .
But that &apos;s how we can also start to restore our environment .
And what about all those big predators , those fashionable species , the same tuna from the green list I mentioned earlier ?
So if you have to , I have a recipe for you .
It will fit every big fish in the ocean , and there it is .
Start with half a pound of a big fish .
Take a knife and cut it into four art .
Put them on four dishes .
Add on these four successes , the vegetables and then developed your best Bornegian wine bottle , turn on the candles and start celebrating .
To celebrate the opportunity that lets you eat it .
You invite your friends and your neighbors and repeat it every year , maybe .
I have a lot of food expectations .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I expect that the ingredients , preparing the doses and eating the meals to be all part of the human interest cooperation ceremony .
I was lucky , and my father was a great kitchen .
And he taught me at the beginning about the privilege of feeding .
I was reminded of my childhood &apos;s meals well .
They were plausible doses of protein that were met with vegetable abundance and small amounts of starch , usually in rice form .
So mostly I still eat today .
I get a discretion in steak .
I &apos;m kidnapping meat ear sweat .
It &apos;s like a protein overlap .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But of all the bad news that you &apos;ll hear and hear about our ocean situation , I &apos;ve fallen in some of the sad role to tell you the worst news of all , which is that all of your mothers are right .
You eat the vegetables .
Very simple .
So what do we look for at lunch ?
For health , I &apos;m looking for full ingredients that are good for my body .
In terms of happiness , I look for buttermilk and salt and sexy things so that tastes will be less sealed .
In terms of family , I look for recipes to be respected to my own history .
But in terms of community , we start from the beginning .
We can &apos;t escape the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
Try if you can learn as best you can what that effect is and then take the first step to minimize it .
We saw a picture of our blue planet , our global bank .
But it &apos;s more than our resource reservoir ; it &apos;s also the world geography of the shared ceremony that we call a meal .
So if we take all of us just as our needs , because then we can start dividing in the rest , we can start to celebrate , we can start to restore .
We need to savor the vegetable taste .
We need to tag on small tastes of seafood .
And we need to start asking our meals .
Thank you .

Hello , I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world that makes paper buildings out of cardboard cardboard like this , and this is the first exhibition I built using paper cylinders .
In 1986 , long before people started talking about ecological and environmental issues , I started looking at using paper cylinders as a building material .
The testing process of matter was very complicated , but it turned out to me that it was a stronger material than I thought it was very easy to make water resistant and yes , because it was an industrial material , there was a possibility of turning it into fire .
In 1990 , I built this material temporary structure .
That was the first building of its kind made of paper .
The structure is made up of 330 cylinders in a 55-centimeter diameter , there are only 12 cylinders in diameter that are 120 centimeters or a four-foot substitute .
As you can see in this picture it &apos;s the bathroom .
If it happened and you run the toilet paper , you can always tear a piece of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a very useful thing .
In 2000 , there was supposed to be a big conference in Germany .
And I was asked to design the building that it would exist because it was a conference that was about environmental issues .
I had to build the conference house from paper cylinders , when it &apos;s recycled paper .
My design goal is not just to make a structure .
It &apos;s about changing what happens when the whale is destroyed eventually , because every country produces a lot of whales and after half a year they are destroyed and creates a large amount of industrial waste , but my building can be recycled or used differently .
When the conference ended , my building was reconstructed .
That was my design goal .
Next , I was lucky to win a competition to build the second Pompedo center in France in a handful city .
Because I was poor , I wanted to hire an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris and together , we built our own office on the roof of the Popedo Center in Paris .
So we brought paper cylinders and wood friends that were required for the completion of the office that had gone down 35 meters .
We &apos;ve been working there for six years without paying rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I faced a big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , if a friend wanted to visit me , he needed to buy a card to see me .
That was the problem .
Or then , it was completed in the building of the Pompedo Center in May .
This is a very popular museum right now , which is a real milestone for the government .
Or then I felt disappointed to my profession as an architect , because we didn &apos;t help or work for society , but for people who are only privileged , rich , government officials , entrepreneurs .
People with wealth and serenity .
These are invisible things .
So they hire our services to visualize their strength and their wealth by creating Monumental architecture .
It &apos;s our profession , it &apos;s the situation in historic vision and now we do the same thing .
So I was very disappointed by not working for society , although there are so many people who have lost their homes because of natural disasters .
If I have to point out that these are not really natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes don &apos;t kill people , buildings that collapse kill people .
Here comes the responsibility of architects .
That &apos;s where people need temporary structures , but there &apos;s no available architects for this kind of work because we &apos;re too busy working for privileged people .
So I thought to myself that even as architects , we can be involved in reinventing temporary homes .
We can make a difference .
That &apos;s why I started working in disaster areas .
In 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
You don &apos;t know how surprised I was when I saw the U.N. refugee camp .
Here are these poor people , freezing them in blankets during the rainfall season , in sponsors built by the U.N. , which were actually put together a simple plastic sheet , in a combination of tree trunks that were embedded in refugees , as you can see here .
Over two million people had planted trees .
Which led to large-scale deforestation and a big environmental problem .
So the U.N. provided them aluminum pipes and aluminum structures .
That were worth a lot of money , so the refugees sold them and started to cut trees again .
So I proposed to use my method to improve the situation using recycled paper cylinders because it &apos;s cheap and strong material , when my budget is 50 dollars per unit .
We built 50 units in an experiment to test the resilience of matter , the effects of humidity , termites and so on .
And then , a year later , in 1995 in Cuba City , Japan , a big earthquake happened .
Roughly to 7,000 people were killed , and parts of the city like Run Naghetta , in the picture , large parts of the city were burned in the fire that broke after the earthquake .
I found that many Vietnamese refugees gathered in Catholic church to escape the sweat even though the building was completely destroyed .
So I went there and proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church from paper cylinders ? &quot;
And the priest said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , did you get crazy ?
That &apos;s what you &apos;re proposing after the fire that &apos;s going on here ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not sure of me but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started to improvise the city of Cuba , and I knew the local Vietnamese community .
They rank in these bad structures covered in plastic sheets in the park .
So I proposed to rebuild them . I raised money , I did a donation event .
I made paper cylinders for them and to make it easier for my students to build them and also to simplify the process of crashing , I built the foundations of beer packs .
So I turned to the capital producer Kirin , please organize , because at the same time the capital producer Asahi used red packs , which doesn &apos;t match the color of the paper cream .
The color match is very important .
I still remember we all expected that the beer grains would come full of beer bottles , but they came empty . ( Laughter ) It was a big disappointment .
So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 of these camps .
I finally got the priest to trust me with the Church sludge .
He said , &quot; &quot; As you raise your money and get your students to do the construction work , my permission is given to you . &quot; &quot; So for five weeks we rebuilt the church .
She was supposed to stand on a pathway for three years , but she actually stood there for 10 years because people were so excited about it .
A while later there was a big earthquake in Taiwan and proposed to donate this church to survivors there , so we broke it apart and sent them there to be reconstructed by volunteers .
The church stayed there as a permanent structure and is there today .
So this building became a permanent structure .
So I asked myself , what is a permanent structure and what is a temporary structure ?
A paper building can also be a permanent structure as long as it likes people .
A concrete structure can also be temporary if it &apos;s built to make money .
In 1999 , a big earthquake happened in Turkey , I went there and used local materials to build shelters .
In 2001 , in West India , I also built shelters .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and the tsunami , I reconstructed the Muslim fishing villages .
In 2008 , in the city of Changardo , in the Sachuan province in China , close to 70,000 people were killed , and many , many schools collapsed and were destroyed because of corruption in the authorities and the contractors .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with Chinese students .
In one month we completed the building of nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
And they &apos;re still used , even after the last earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in the city of Chile , Italy , there was also a big earthquake .
And here &apos;s a very interesting picture : former Prime Minister Berceloney and former former former prime minister Esso — because you know , we &apos;re replacing the prime minister once a year .
And they kindly funded my idea .
I proposed that large-scale rampant , but temporary performance , because the city for Akilla is known for her connection to music and all her performing tools were destroyed , so the musicians started leaving .
So I told the mayor I &apos;d like to build a temporary auditorium .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you are the one who raise the money , you are invited to do it . &quot; &quot; I was very lucky .
The Prime Minister Berceloney brought the G8 peak , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us raise the funds and got half a million Euros from the Japanese government to build the temporary auditorium .
In 2010 , there was a big earthquake in Haiti , but you couldn &apos;t go there , so I flew to Santu Domingos , a neighboring country and from there I went for six hours to Haiti and with local students from Santo Domingos , we built 50 local paper cylinders .
Here &apos;s what happened in Japan two years ago , in Northern Japan .
After the earthquake and the tsunami , we had to turn people into a large space like the Integrated Hall .
But notice , there are no privacy .
People were suffering as a result of that , mentally and physically .
So I went there with my students to build papercutting , which combined with curtains created a simple , efficient shelter .
However , some of the local executives didn &apos;t want us to do it because basically it makes it difficult to control it in place .
But there was a real need to do that .
There were not enough available spaces needed to build the temporary structures on the ground that the government sent as you see here .
Notice , even the authorities did a pretty bad job building the temporary housing , a dense , messy building , without storage areas , water champions , so I thought we had to build a multi-dimensional structure because there &apos;s not enough space and it would be a more comfortable solution .
So I proposed this to the mayor while building the crossroads .
Eventually , I met a very nice mayor in UNagua village in Michigi .
He asked me to build three-dimensional structures on basketball courses .
I used the containers and the students helped generate all the furniture needed to create comfortable residential structures and all of that within the government budget , the area of housing units was the same , but they were much more comfortable than the government .
Many people wanted to stay there forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Today I work in the city of CrystChurch , New Zealand .
About 20 days before the earthquake in Japan , they also experienced an earthquake and a lot of Japanese students were killed , the most important cathedral in the CrystChurch Harbor , was destroyed even .
I was asked to come and build the temporary church .
Now the structure is in the introduction processes .
And I &apos;d like to continue to create structures that people love and value .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What happens in this baby &apos;s brain ?
If we asked this question 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would say that this baby is irrational , irrational , aggregated — that it can &apos;t take into account another person &apos;s point of view or understand reason and outcome .
In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely transformed this picture .
So in some ways , we think this baby &apos;s mindset is similar to the way the most brilliant scientists think .
Let me give you an example of this .
One of the things that this baby can think about is the thing that can engage his brain , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the other baby &apos;s brain .
After all , one of the hardest things for all of us is to understand what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the most difficult thing is to realize that what other people feel and think doesn &apos;t match what we feel and think .
Anyone who tracks politics can witness how hard it can be for certain people .
We wanted to know , could babies and little children understand this fundamental thing about other people .
Now the question is : How can we ask them ?
Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if we ask a three-year-old boy about what he thinks , what we get is a beautiful stream of a straight monologue from the consciousness of phony horses and birthday and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well , it turns out the secret was broccoli .
What we did , Betty Rafkolly , who was my student , and I , actually , was to give babies two bowls with food : one bowl of uncooked broccoli and another bowl with delicious crackers in the form of gold .
All babies , even in Berkeley , love the glaciers and not the broccoli .
( Laughter ) But what Bertie did was taste a little bit of each of the forests .
And then she behaved like love what she took , or not .
Half of the time she behaved like she loved the crackers and not the broccoli — like a baby and any other healing person .
But in the other half of the cases , she took a little piece of broccoli and said , &quot; &quot; Mmm , broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the projectors , and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Ice , Yuck , cool !
I tasted the crackers . Ice , Yuck , she behaved like what she wanted was the opposite thing from what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15-year-olds and 18 months old .
So she would take her hand and say , &quot; Can you give me a little bit ? &quot;
So the question is : What would give her the babies ? What they loved or what she loved ?
And the amazing thing was that 18 months old babies who barely went and talked , gave her the glaciers if she loved the glaciers , but gave her the broccoli if she loved the broccoli .
On the other hand , 15-month-old babies just stared at it for a long time if they behaved like love the broccoli , as if they couldn &apos;t understand it .
But after they had been staring at her for a long time , they just gave her the glaciers , what they thought everyone liked .
So there are two amazing things about this .
The first is that these little babies , 18 months old , have already discovered this deep fact associated with human nature that we don &apos;t always want the same things .
Moreover , they felt that they had to do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more notable is the fact that since the 15-month-old boys did not do that suggesting that these 18 months have learned the deep and profound fact associated with human nature in the three months that have gone from being 15 months old .
It means that children know more and learn more than we would think .
And this is just one of many hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that really prove this .
The question you might ask is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short period of time ?
After all , if we look at babies , at first sight they look pretty useless .
In fact , in many ways they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to spend so much time and energy just to keep them alive .
But if we look at evolution to find an answer to why we spend so much time caring for useless babies , it turns out there &apos;s actually a clear answer .
If we look at many , many species of animals , not just primates like us , but other mammals , birds , even pockets like Venezuelo , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between the length of childhood and the size of the brain compared to the body and how smart and flexible the creatures are .
We chose &quot; &quot; Poster Girls &quot; &quot; the two birds here .
On the one hand is the New Claudian chicken .
The mixing and other Westerners , the Arabs and so forth are surprisingly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in certain ways .
And this is a bird on the cover of Science magazine who has learned to use the tool to get food .
On the other side , we have our twisted chicken member .
Avaz , ducks , chickens and chickens of India are actually as dumb as serious .
They &apos;re very good at using nuclear , but they &apos;re not really good at anything else .
Well , it turns out that the baby babies of the victim , they &apos;re getting sick .
They rely on their mother to put worms in their little mouths to a two-year period , which is a very long time in the lifespan of a bird .
While the chickens are actually mature in a few months .
So childhood is why the arteries come to the Science Magazine and the chicken ends up in a Mark boat .
There &apos;s something about this long childhood that seems to do with knowledge and learning .
So what kind of explanation do we have for this ?
Some animals , like the chickens look wonderfully adapted to doing one task very well .
So they &apos;re really adapted to monitoring the nuclei in a particular environment .
While other creatures , like the punishments , are not very good at anything , but they &apos;re very good at studying the rules of different environments .
And of course , we &apos;re at the edge of the spectrum like the pens .
We have bigger brains compared to our bodies much more than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , more flexible , our learning capacity is bigger , we survive in different environments , we &apos;ve been retired to cover the world and even reach outer space .
And our kids and babies depend on us much longer than any other species .
My son is 23 years old .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 years old , we &apos;re still throwing these worms into their little open mouth .
Okay , why do you see this correlation ?
Perhaps this strategy , this teaching strategy , is a very good strategy to get in this world , but it has one big disadvantage .
And that downside is that until you actually end learning everything , you &apos;re helpless .
So you don &apos;t really want the death to chase you and ask yourself , &quot; A swallow or maybe a parking can fit . Who is better ? &quot;
You want to know all this before the deaths come .
And the way evolution seems to solve this problem is through a kind of role-sharing .
The idea is that we have the early period in which we are absolutely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then , as adults , we can take all those things that we &apos;ve learned as babies and children and use them to do tasks in the real world .
So one way to think about it is that babies and small children are like the research department and development of the human species .
So they &apos;re these guys that all they need to do is go out and learn and come up with good ideas , and we &apos;re manufacturing and marketing .
We need to take all these ideas that we &apos;ve learned from being children and really using them .
Another way to think about this is that instead of thinking about babies and children as scaffolding adults , we need to think of them as a different developmental phase of the same species — a little bit like larvae and butterflies — except that they &apos;re the great butterflies that spin the gene and explore their environment , and we &apos;re the larvae that crawl along the narrow , adult path .
If that &apos;s true , if babies are really designed to learn and this evolutionary story will tell us that children are meant to learn , that &apos;s why they live , we might expect them to have very strong learning mechanisms in their hands .
And indeed , a baby &apos;s brain is probably the most powerful learning computer in the world .
But real computers are getting really better .
There was a revolution of really the way we understand machine learning recently .
Everything relies on the ideas of this guy , the Thomist Bayes priest , who was a statistician and a mathematician in the 18th century .
Basically , what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , to describe the way scientists discover things about the world .
So how do scientists work ? They assume a hypothesis that they think is likely .
And then they go and test it against the evidence .
The proof makes them change the hypothesis .
And then they test the new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Byce showed was a mathematical way to do that .
And this mathematics underlies learning programs through the best machine we have today .
About 10 years ago , I proposed the idea that babies do the same thing .
So if you want to know what happens beyond these beautiful brown eyes , I think it looks something like this .
This is the author of the Bayes priest .
So I think these babies actually do complicated calculations with a luxury probability that they analyze to understand how the world works .
It can look like something too complicated to really prove .
Because after all , if you ask adults about statistics , they &apos;ll look very stupid .
So how could kids do statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we used called the Blickminet detector .
It &apos;s a box where a light bulb sits and plays music when you put certain pieces on it , and with others , no .
And using this simple machine , my lab and other labs have done dozens of studies that show how good babies really are at teaching the world .
Let me just show you one we did with Mr. Kunner , my student .
If I showed you this detector , you probably would start to think that the way to activate the detector would be to put a cube on the detector .
In reality , this detector works in a slightly odd way .
If we wave the cube over the detector , which we wouldn &apos;t think of , the detector will actually work twice out of three .
Whereas if you do the obvious thing , which is to put the cube on the detector , the detector will only work twice out of six .
So the less likely assumption actually has stronger evidence .
It seems like the periphery of the cube above the detector is a better strategy than the other strategy .
So here &apos;s how we did ; we gave the four-year-olds this evidence pattern and asked them to make it work .
And indeed , these kids used the evidence pattern to wave the cube over the detector .
We found two particularly interesting things about this .
The first is — again , remember , this is four year-old children .
Only you learn to count .
But unconsciously they do pretty complicated calculations that give them a tool to measure mass probability .
And the other interesting thing is that they use evidence that they &apos;ve been given to get a sense , to get an assumption about the world , which seems very unlikely in the first place .
In the studies that we did in my lab , similar studies , we showed that four year-olds are better at discovering unlikely assumptions than adults who gave them the same task .
In these circumstances , children use statistics to learn about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see , whether the children do experiments too .
When kids do experiments , we call it to deal with anything or , play . There &apos;s been some interesting research done recently that showed that this game is actually a kind of experimental research .
Here &apos;s one of Cristine Lab Laboratory .
Cristine used the Blicket detector .
She showed the kids that yellow polarity make the detector act and red no , and then she showed them an outlier .
What you &apos;ll see here is that this little boy will pass between five different assumptions in a two-minute period of time .
Child : How about that ?
Same thing as the other side .
Alison Gobak : Okay , his first assumption failed .
( Laughter ) Child : It gets on , and it &apos;s nothing .
AG : OK , he took out his test pad .
Child : What makes it gasoline ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every researcher will recognize this despair view .
( Laughter ) Boy : Maybe because it should be like this , and it should be like this .
AG : OK , assume number two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh ...
( Laughter ) AG : Now you go to a new idea .
He told the researcher to do this , to try to put it on the other side .
It doesn &apos;t work either .
Boy : Ah , because the light goes away just here , not here .
Oh , at the bottom of this box there &apos;s electricity , and yet , no .
AG : OK , that &apos;s a fourth assumption .
Boy : It &apos;s on fire .
So when you &apos;re there four .
So that &apos;s what you have to put four in order for it to fuel and two on it so it &apos;s going to fuel .
AG : OK , here &apos;s his fifth assumption .
Now , this is a very cute , intelligent kid , but what Cristine discovered is that actually it &apos;s not something unusual about normal .
If you watch kids play , if we ask them to explain something to us , what they actually do is a series of experiments .
It &apos;s actually quite common in four-year-olds .
So , how is it going to be this kind of production ?
How is it like to be one of these wonderful butterflies that can test five assumptions in two minutes ?
If we go back to all those psychologists and philosophers , many of them indicate that babies and little children hardly have awareness , if anything .
I think exactly the opposite is the right .
I think babies and little children are more aware of what we are , adults .
That &apos;s what we know about how adults &apos; awareness works .
The awareness and attention of adults seem like a kind of light champion .
What happens in adults is that we decide that something is relevant or important , so we should pay attention to it .
Our awareness of the same thing that we concentrate becomes very clear and full of life , and everything else as if it goes into the dark .
We even know something about how the brain does it .
What happens , when we &apos;re attached to something is that the prefrontal cortex , part of the management of our brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain much more flexible , much more plastic , much better in learning , and closes the activity in all of our brains .
It causes a kind of very concentrated attention , target terms .
If we look at babies and little children , we &apos;ll find something completely different .
I think babies and little children have a kind of a tenth of consciousness , than a divine of consciousness .
So , little babies and children are really not good at getting to one particular thing .
But they &apos;re very good at pumping a lot of information from many sources at once .
And if we look at their brains , they seem to be flooded in such neural passages that are great at teaching learning and flexibility , and the parts of the horses have not yet appeared .
So when we say babies and little children are not successful at making attention , what we &apos;re actually saying is they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
They &apos;re bad at ignoring all the interesting things they can learn something and just look at what &apos;s really important .
It &apos;s a kind of attention , of consciousness , that we can anticipate from those butterflies designed to learn .
If we want to think about how to taste this kind of baby awareness , as adults , I think the best way is to think about all the cases we &apos;ve been put in a situation where we &apos;ve never been before , when we fall in love with somebody new , or when we &apos;re in a city for the first time .
What &apos;s happening is not that our consciousness is shrinking , it &apos;s expanding , so these three days in Paris seem more full of experiences and awareness than all the months of being the kind of zombie going , talking and participating in academic meetings , there , at home .
And by the way , that beautiful coffee that you drink down , actually simulates the phenomenon of the infant &apos;s neural transmitters .
So how is it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love with Paris , for the first time after infrastructure three times espresso .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great way to exist , but it has a tendency to make you wake up in tears at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
We can do things like linking sandwiches or moving the road alone .
And it &apos;s kind of obvious that investors spend a lot of effort making babies think the way adults think .
But if all we want is to be like these butterflies , to be able to learn , to keep an open head , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least in part of the time we need to get adults to start thinking more like children .

I &apos;m going to share with you a story about how I became an activist in the fight for HIV .
And this is the name of the activity , the journey of the poem .
In November of 2003 , I was invited to join the launch of the Nelson Mandela Foundation of 4664 , this is his foundation for the fight for HIV .
The number 4664 is the number of inmates of Mandela in prison in Ruben Island .
And this is me with Yoso Nador on stage , frantically enjoying .
The next day , all the artists were invited to join a volunteer at the Ruben Island where he was going to do a press conference for journalists around the world , he was standing before the prison .
You can see the bars in the window there .
It was an exciting moment for all of us .
At that moment Mandela announced that the world &apos;s virtual marriage press takes place in his country after the Halloween nations thousands of dead every day and the biggest victims were the women and the children .
It really influenced me because I &apos;m a woman , and I &apos;m a mother and I didn &apos;t realize that the HIV epidemic is directly influencing women .
And so I feel committed — when I left South Africa when I left Cape Town , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; This is something I have to talk about .
I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And as a result of that , I participated in every 4664 fund event that I could get to , I did a press conference , I used my musical capacity with my commitment to a volunteer from an appreciation of the tremendous and impossible work he did .
Everybody in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone admires Nelson Mandela .
But do they know what &apos;s happening in South Africa , his country , with the highest number of infections of the virus ?
I think if I went out on the street now and I would tell people what was going on there , they would be stunned .
I was very lucky , two years later when I met the elders of the journey to active politician activist activist activism .
I met at a 46664 event .
He &apos;s wearing a t-shirt like a shirt that I &apos;m wearing now .
This is a tool that tells you that I &apos;m in solidarity with people who have AIDS , people who live with HIV .
In a way , because of the stigma , by wearing the shirt , I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
It shouldn &apos;t be inside the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a company on a journey to a politician action , and I &apos;m very proud to be a company in this amazing organization .
It &apos;s a root journey with 80 percent of women as members of them with HIV positive .
They work on the ground .
They have a huge impact on the people who live directly with the effects of the virus .
They have an educational plan .
They &apos;re looking at the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s extraordinary what they do .
And indeed , my journey of song supported a journey to political action in a way that I tried to raise awareness and also tried to raise money .
A lot of the contributions that I &apos;ve been able to recruit have been directly on a journey to political action and amazing work that they do and they continue to do in South Africa .
So this is my song journey .
The journey of the song is basically me and three or four great people helping me .
I &apos;ve been traveling around the world for the last two and a half years , I &apos;ve been in about 12 different countries .
Here I am in Oslo , Norway getting a singing oil cliff in Hong Kong , trying to convince people to raise money .
In Honsburg , I had the opportunity to play to the audience , white mostly , from the middle class in South Africa who eventually used movies that really touched them , all the way this terrible tragedy happens that people tend to ignore because they &apos;re tired and they don &apos;t really know what the solutions are .
Aaron Mutsfeli , the current health minister was at this show and I had the opportunity to meet him and he gave me his full commitment to try and make a change that is really essential .
This is the Scottish Parliament .
After that , I became a mission for Scotland and HIV .
And I showed them my experience and tried , again , to inspire awareness .
And one more time in Edinburgh with the African Children &apos;s Choir that I just admire .
And these kids , many of them are orphaned because their family is affected by HIV / AIDS .
Here I &apos;m sitting in New York with Michelle Sidba is the director of New England .
It &apos;s a great honor for me of the fact that Michelle invited me a few months ago to be the director of New HIV .
And in this way I held my show and expanded my degree of influence .
The message that YouTube and AIDS are now sending all over the world is that we want to see the virtual eradication of the infection of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
It can happen .
And here I am with a pregnant woman who has HIV positive and we smile , both of us smile , because we are very confident because we know that this young woman gets treated so that her life will take care of the baby she &apos;s about to be born .
And her baby will get a PMTCT saying that this baby can be born clean from the virus .
Now this is a prevention and really at the beginning of life .
This is one way to start looking at intervention in the HIV epidemic .
Now , I want to end by telling you a little story about a nightmare .
This is a nightmare , she goes with me everywhere I go .
I tell her story to everybody because she represents one of the millions of AIDS orphans .
The mother of Evinight had the HIV virus , she died of disease caused by the virus .
The night had the virus , she was born with the virus .
And here she is seven years old weighing no longer than a one-year-old baby .
And at this moment in her life she was suffering from AIDS fully , she had pneumonia .
We met her in a hospital in East Cape last afternoon with her — a great girl .
The doctors and nurses were amazing .
They gave her very special food and cared for her most .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital because we shot her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So of course , it was a very exciting encounter and left us very charged with this beautiful experience of one girl , you know , this story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Abiv again .
And I come up with my hypotheses — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hypotheses on my hands .
They count , because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
That &apos;s the change that &apos;s happened .
Isn &apos;t that amazing ?
( Applause ) These wings are really for doctors and nurses of the hospital who were worried about the night .
And I realize that you appreciate the change .
So I want to tell you for each of you in the audience if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the privilege of getting good food and good medical care and you believe that the millennium Development Goals primarily five and six have to be completely committed by all governments in the world , especially in South Africa , please stand up on your feet .
I think it &apos;s pretty accurate that it &apos;s almost everyone in this room .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago in the former Soviet Union , a group of scientists led to a large bone site through a silent rural area .
By which they hoped to capture people &apos;s minds everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
The rocket was huge in size .
And Bretu was a silver pack with two transmitters in it .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to create a new universe that &apos;s called Sputnik .
Back in the early days , countries like Vasco Dragma and Colombia were lucky in their exposure of the terrestrial world .
Now we &apos;re lucky at expecting space .
And it will be the role of the future people to freeze in our happiness . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re looking at pieces from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary film , which is almost complete .
He describes the story of Sputnik , and what happened to America as a result of it .
For days after the launch , Sputnik was a curious and wonderful thing .
A man-made moon that ordinary citizens are able to see , has inspired an awe and a pride that humans will eventually launch an object into space .
But only three days later , on the day that the Red Monday , the Ministry of Communications and politicians told us , and we believed them , Sputnik had evidence that our enemies had increased us in science and technology , and now they &apos;re able to attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as a medieval rocket .
Taking chaos .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three tattoos in America — equal to its power , to claim historians , to Pearl Harbor or 11.9 .
He woke up the rocket gap .
He inflated the arms race .
He started the race into space .
Within a year , Congress has funded huge weapons , and our number of nuclear weapons has grown from 1,200 to 20,000 .
And the responses to the Sputnik have gone beyond growing weapons .
For example , some of you will remember this day , in June 1958 , the national exercise in civic security , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went down underground .
Or the Gallup survey that showed that seven out of 10 Americans believed that nuclear war would spread , and because at least 50 percent of our population would be killed .
But Sputnik also made wonderful changes .
For example , some of the residents of this room have learned in school about a scholarship after Sputnik .
Encourage the engineering professions , math and science — education generally — has grown rapidly .
Vinet Serf claims that Sputnik led directly to PEA and the Internet , and of course , NASA .
My documentary film shows how a free society can rape in panic because of those who know how to use the medium .
But it also shows us how we can turn what initially looks like a bad situation , something that was generally very good for America .
Sputnik will be released soon to the foundation .
To conclude , I &apos;d like to thank one of my investors : a TED artist for a long time , Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank all of you .

Thank you , Chris .
Today , a confused lady noticed in a church where my soul lives and announced that I &apos;m &quot; &quot; furniture , &quot; &quot; which means when it comes to expression and grammar I don &apos;t even think about it because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; furniture . &quot; &quot; So when my professor asked a question and my answer is summarized in the context of an urban proposal , there &apos;s no wrong intent to notice because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; So my father said , &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a terrible question .
So when my son says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s good with you Ben ? &quot; &quot; I just said , &quot; &quot; I just intervened with these people but I &apos;m finished ! &quot; &quot; And sometimes in class I might stop the bat that sounds intellectual to ask , &quot; Oh ! Why are these books never about my people ? &quot; &quot; Yes , I decided to address all three languages as a comparison because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; Rosetta &quot; &quot; but who &apos;s controlling the furniture ?
Because the English language is internal literacy is subject to endless changes now , you might think it &apos;s ignorance of a broken English speaker , but I &apos;m here to tell you that even Americans &quot; &quot; furniture &quot; sound silly to English , so when my professor comes to the neighborhood and says , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; I stop him and says , &quot; &quot; LAA ... You &apos;re not articulate — the right way to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not even here .
The word &quot; &quot; crazy &quot; &quot; never came before the present simply is an English principle . &quot; &quot; If I had the voice capability I would sing from every mountain , from every provoir , and every neighborhood because the only God of the language is the one recorded in the creation of this word which means &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; So I may not always come before you with a great speech but don &apos;t judge me by my language and my language language phrase , sometimes I speak three languages .
And then replacing so that I won &apos;t get bored afterwards , sometimes I fight two languages , while I use third of the class and when I mix them by mistake , I &apos;m a crazy analogy like — I cook in the bathroom , I know that I had to borrow your language because mine was a genius but you can &apos;t anticipate your history completely while my own words is broken by someone who just got tired of my own dictatorship , and the reason that my history is made up .
I speak English broken so that deep incisions can remind us that our current situation is not a mystery , I &apos;m so tired of the negative images that make my people crazy , so unless you saw him robbing a bank stop calling my hair so bad I &apos;m tired of the unreasonable racist variation , then don &apos;t call it good , unless your hair is known as a donor to charity like Anas our people , how you can perceive it as a misconception .
It &apos;s not promoting this ignorance as a linguistic celebration , so I put &quot; &quot; speak three languages &quot; &quot; on my previous work form , I can divert your consumer market is all I want them to know and when they call me an interview I &apos;ll be more happy to show that I can say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s good ? &quot; &quot; And of course ... &quot; &quot; Peace &quot; &quot; because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; reputation . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

Good morning . So magic is a great way to stay ahead of the reality curve , to allow us today what science will become a reality tomorrow .
As a cyber magician , I combine illusion and science elements to give us the sense of how we experience future technologies .
You &apos;ve all heard of the Glass project of Google .
It &apos;s a new technology . You &apos;re looking through them and the world you see is enriched by information : names of places , sculptures , buildings , maybe one day even the names of strangers passing by you on the street .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little larger . They &apos;re a prototype .
And when you look through them , you get a glimpse of a cyber magician &apos;s brain .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a play card . Every card will match .
There we go . And let me mark it so that we can identify it when we see it again .
All right . Simon Bolt .
Let &apos;s bring it back to the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s start .
( Music ) System : The system is ready . Take a picture .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards consists of four different sets : heart , clubs , diamonds , and leaf .
The cards are the oldest of symbols , and they got many different interpretations .
Now , some say that four decline symbolizes , the four seasons .
These are spring , summer , fall and ... system : My favorite season is winter . Marco : Yes , on me .
A winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when heat becomes cold , water for snow , and then everything goes away .
There are 13 cards per series . ( Music ) System : Every card represents a stage in 13 of the Moon cycles .
Marco : So here it &apos;s a replicator , and here &apos;s a tide , and in the middle it &apos;s the moon .
System : The Moon is one of the most controversial parts of the magic .
Marco : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
There &apos;s the red and the black color , symbolizing the eternal change from day to night .
SS : Marco , I didn &apos;t know you could do that . ( Laughter ) Marco : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in the deck , like there are 52 weeks a year ?
( Music ) System : If you look at all the symbols in a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
Marco : Oh , 365 , the number of days a year , the number of days between birthday .
Vote a wish . ( Shrubbing ) System : Don &apos;t reveal , or it won &apos;t adapt .
Marco : Well , in fact , it was my sixth birthday when I got my first piece of cards , and since that day , I traveled around the world a magic expedition for children and girls , men and women , husbands and ideas , and even queens and queens . ( Applause ) System : And who are these ? Marco : Ah , shuffles . Look .
Wake up .
Jawker : Whoa . Marco : Are you ready for a party ?
JC : Ready ! Marco : Let &apos;s see what you have .
Jawker : I &apos;m showing my pogo stick . Marco : Ah , caution .
Jawker : Whoa , whoa , ooh ! ( Music ) Marco : But today , I &apos;m doing a different kind of audience .
I do it for you .
Soldier : A curved card identifies . Marco : Well , sometimes people ask me , how were you a magician ? Is it a nine to five job ?
Of course not ! You have to train 24 / 7 .
I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
Twenty-seven is a little bit of an initiative , but it requires training . Now , people will say , yes , cosmos , it must be the work of some bad superpower . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
Well , that &apos;s what I say , no .
In fact , in German , it &apos;s a building building . ( Laughter ) Magic is not that powerful . I have to warn you , if you ever play with someone who distributes cards like this , don &apos;t bet money .
( Music ) System : Why not ? It &apos;s a great hand .
The chances of getting it are 4,165 to one .
Marco : Yeah , but my hand is better . We won the odds .
System : I think you &apos;ve got your birthday wish . Marco : And it leaves me with the latest and most important card : this very important marker card .
And nothing like anything we just saw , virtual or not .
Marco Digital : That &apos;s certainly the real thing .
Marco : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years , and I &apos;ve gone to TED I .
And the third one is a little bit less obvious .
Did they all agree ? No , not really .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
I have so much money . I can keep playing forever .
I grew up in the poorest country in India , Bahar . I remember when I was six years old , I came home one day and found a cart full of delicious candy on the doorstep .
Me and my brothers were in the cart and then my father came home .
He was filled with rage , and I still remember how we cried when the cart with the candy that half of them had already eaten , taken away from us .
I later realized why my father was so upset .
These clicks were a contractor bribe trying to model my father to give him a government contract .
My father was responsible for building roads in Bahar and he took a robust position against corruption , despite harassment and threats .
He was lonely in Bahau , because Bahar was also the most corrupt country in India , where government officials would enrich themselves , rather than serving the poor who didn &apos;t have the tools to express their mental bend if their children had no food or school .
I experienced it in a very concrete way when I went to remote villages to study poverty .
And when I moved from village to village , I remember one day , when I was hungry and exhausted , and close to collapse , I sat in the hot heat under the tree , just then , one of the poorest residents in that village invited me into his hut and very generously fed me .
Only later I realized that what he gave me was the food for the entire family .
This gesture of extreme generosity has been challenging my vision of purpose in life and changed it .
I made a determined decision to give back .
Later , I joined the World Bank , who asked to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich countries to poor countries .
My first job was in Uganda , where I focused on negotiating with the Uganda Ministry of Finance on reforms so that they would be entitled to our loans .
But after we had transferred the loans , I remember a journey in Uganda where I found schools that had just been built without textbooks or teachers , new clinics without drugs , and the poor again with no expression and no assistance .
I mean , it was like Bahar .
Bahar represents the challenge of development : frustrating poverty and surrounded by corruption .
All over the world , 1.3 billion people live on less than 1.25 dollars a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems and implementation since 1944 , when the winners in World War II , the 500 founding fathers , and if one single founder , gather in New Hampshire , the United States , to establish Bretton and Drugs institutions , including the World Bank .
In the traditional approach to development there were three ingredients , the first , transferring resources from rich countries in northern poor countries in the south , accompanying prescriptions to reforms .
The second , the development institutions that made these resources were not really transparent , with small transparency to what they funded or the results they got .
And third , the engagement in developing countries was in a short framework of government elites with a small touch with citizens , which is actually the final goal of development aid .
Today , each of these components is beginning to change due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
Open knowledge , open aid , open government , that together , represent three key changes that change the nature of development and that gives hope about the problems that I saw in Uganda and Bahar .
The first key change is open knowledge .
The developing countries today are not willing to accept just that solutions that are imposed above by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
They get their inspiration , their hope , their knowledge and their practical experience , from growing economies and succeeding from the South .
They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how the Opunning program of Mexico improved the education and nutrition of millions of children .
This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flow , not just a journey from north to south , but from south to south , even from south to north , like with the Opun-iadas program of Mexico that inspires New York City today .
And while transferring such messages from the north to the South is opening , so are the development institutions that transcend these transfers .
And that &apos;s the second change : open aid .
Recently , the World Bank has developed its data supply for public use by releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators of 200 countries , collected over 50 years , and it has launched a global competition for crowdsourcing new applications through this data .
Today , development institutions are also exposed to public criticism about the projects they fund .
Let &apos;s take GeoMing . On this map of Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools are funded are contributed , and the higher the diversity of the green is darker , the more kids there are not going to school .
So , this simple display reveals that donors have not funded any school in areas where there are the most children left outside of school , which has inspired new questions . Is development assistance actually there to target those who need our help most ?
Similarly the World Bank has now mapped 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and donors are using this shared platform to map all their projects .
This is a big leap forward in terms of transparency and accountability for aid .
This leads me to the third transformation , and I think , the most significant change in development : openness of government . Governments are developing as citizens are prosecuted to play their voice and accountability .
From the Arab Spring to the movement of Anna Hazara in India , through mobile phones and social networks , not only to demand accountability on political issues but also to demand responsibility for development .
Like , are governments providing services to citizens ?
So for example , some governments in Africa and East Europe reveal their budgets to the public .
But as you know , there &apos;s a big difference between budget and public and budget that is accessible and understandable .
It &apos;s a public budget . ( Laughter ) As you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to the ordinary citizen who &apos;s trying to figure out how government uses its resources .
To deal with this problem , governments use new tools to make the budget more visual and so more understood for the public .
On this map from Moldova , the green color shows low-cost quarters on schools but with good educational outcomes . The red color shows the opposite .
Such tools help turn entire documents that can &apos;t be understood , into something visual and understandable to the general public , and what &apos;s exciting is that with openness , there are new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and be in touch with government .
So , in the Philippines today , students and parents can give real-time feedback on the site , CheckysticisChool.org , or through SMS , if teachers and textbooks are in school , the same problems I noticed in Uganda and Bahar .
And the government is poor . So for example , when the site was reported that 800 students were at risk because the repairing in the school were designed for corruption , the Ministry of Education in Philippines was taking a fast action .
And what &apos;s exciting about this story is that this innovation is now spreading from south to south , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Maduba and even beyond .
In Dar al-Selam , Tanzania , even a poor community was able to use these tools to express its aspirations .
This is what the map of Tandale looks like in August 2011 , but within a few weeks , the students were able to use mobile phones and open source platform to fundamentally map the entire community infrastructure .
And what &apos;s very exciting is that citizens were then able to feedback the dots of clinics or water supply that didn &apos;t work — concentrated in red bubbles , which provide together a graphic view of the collective voice of the poor .
Today , even Bahar changes to the better and opens under a commitment leadership that makes government transparent , accessible and such an ever-poor one .
But , in many parts of the world , governments don &apos;t want to open or serve the poor , and it &apos;s a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are the only warriors like my father and many others , and the important frontier of development work is to help those who dream alone , to combine their hands and so they can overcome the difficulties .
So for example , today in Ghana , brave reformers from the public service , from the Parliament and the government , have created a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil field , which is that restrained reformers in Parliament to study skeptical contracts .
These examples provide new hope , new possibilities for the Mall of the problems I &apos;ve seen in Uganda or the problems my father dealt with in Bahar .
Two years ago , on April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was very late at night , and at the age of 80 , Dad was in the middle of typing a 70-page representative lawsuit against corruption in a road rail project .
Even though he wasn &apos;t a lawyer , he represented himself the case in a court the next day , and he won the paragraph , but later that evening , he died .
It fought up to the end , with enthusiasm that went and increased , because to fight corruption and poverty , not only government officials should be straight , but also citizens should come together to make a voice heard .
These became two end markers of his book of life , and the journey he did between them reflected the changing landscape of development .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that in the World Bank , we &apos;re embrace these new directions — a significant change compared to my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
We need to fundamentally bring the decision removal over development so that knowledge will flow in different directions , which will inspire the businesses in which aid will become transparent , to such that the data is criticized and beneficial , so governments will open and citizens engage in it and get a reform encouragement in government .
We need to accelerate these changes .
If we do that , we &apos;ll find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bahar , in Uganda and beyond .
We &apos;ll find that textbooks and teachers will find in school for the children .
We &apos;ll find that even these kids , there will be a real chance to break their way out of the cycle of poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause )
So imagine a plane is going to crack and within 250 children and babies , if you knew how to prevent it , you would then do it ?
Now imagine 60 planes full of babies under five crash every day .
That &apos;s the number of children who can &apos;t get to their fifth birthday .
Sixty-six million children can &apos;t get to their fifth birthday .
Most of these deaths are preventable , and it doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me slow .
Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the two great killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases is not some new technological innovations .
This is one of the oldest inventions in the world : soap package .
Hands washing with soap , the leg that we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea in half , can reduce infections in the respiratory system in a third .
Bap washing can affect flu reduction , migraine , SARS , and recently in cases of cholera and the Ebola outbreak , one of the important interventions is a washing of hands in soap .
Bap washing leaves kids in school .
It prevents babies from dying .
Bap washing is one of the most effective ways to save children &apos;s lives .
It can save over 600,000 children every year .
It &apos;s worth stopping 10 jambo planes full of babies and kids crashing every day .
I think you &apos;ll agree with me that this is a relatively useful public interest intervention .
So now take a moment .
I think you need to know the person sitting next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just press each other hands ?
Please shake hands .
All right , know each other .
They look very beautiful .
Okay .
So what if I told you that the person with whom you took hands just a moment ago actually didn &apos;t washed his hands out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so beautiful now , right ?
You will agree with me that this is relatively disgusting .
Well , the truth is that statistics show that four out of five people don &apos;t washed their hands out of the toilet , around the world .
And in the same way , we don &apos;t do that when we have spectacular toilets , running water , and soap in reach , that &apos;s the same thing in countries where the child death rate is really high .
What &apos;s the problem ? No soap ?
The truth is , there &apos;s soap within reach .
In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent in Kenya , you will find soap .
Even in countries where soap is the least present , like Ethiopia , we &apos;re standing on 50 percent .
Why is that ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
Why from Inc , the young guy I met in India , doesn &apos;t wash his hands ?
Well , in Inc &apos;s family , you use spring-soap , you use soap to wash , you use soap to wash tools .
His parents sometimes think it &apos;s an expensive commodity , so they keep it in the closet .
They keep it away from it so they don &apos;t waste it .
On average , in the family of Inc , they use soap to wash hands one day in the best case , and sometimes even one per week .
What are the results of this ?
Children are infected with disease where they &apos;re supposed to be loved and protected , in their home .
Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
Did you learn to wash hands at home ?
Did you learn to wash hands in school ?
I think behavior scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you developed early on .
However , we all copy what everybody does and social norms sometimes are something that affects how we change our behavior , and that &apos;s where the private sector comes in .
Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers bought this soap to protect their family .
Many women in India will tell you that they learn everything about hygiene , disease , from this soap sign from the Libracoy brand .
The iconic brands like this have the responsibility to do well in places where they sell their products .
This belief , and the size of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about washing hands with soap and hygiene with these mothers .
Big businesses and brands can change and manipulate social norms and make a difference in those habits is all so major .
Think about it : marketers spend all of their time passing us from a brand to a brand .
And in fact , they know how to turn science and facts into convincing messages .
Just for a moment , imagine when they combine all their forces behind a strong message like a washing of hands with soap .
The drive to profits changes health outcomes in this world .
But this happens for hundreds of the &quot; &quot; black buoy &quot; &quot; brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to fight cholera .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the Secretary of Health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera epidemic in Ghana right now .
One hundred and eight years later , the solution is the same solution : is to ensure that they have access to this soap , and that they use it , because that &apos;s the number one way to stop the cholera epidemic from spreading .
I think this motivation for profit is particularly powerful , often stronger than the charity organization or the most determined government .
The government does what it can , especially in cases of epidemics like cholera , or Ebola right now , but with priorities competing .
The budget isn &apos;t always there .
And when you think about it , you think about what it takes to make a droplet of hands a daily habit , it takes an attractive funding to strengthen that leg .
In short , these are the fighting for public health actually depend on soap societies to further promote a washing of hands with soap .
We have friends like USAID , the global private partnerships for washing hands with soap , the London School for Magna and Tropical Drugs , Plan , WaterAA all believes in a one-way partnership .
Public sector profit , because we can help them reach their goals .
A profit for the private sector , because we &apos;re building new generations of future handbags .
And most importantly , a marginalized profit .
On October 15th , we will celebrate the day of international handling .
schools , communities , we partnered with the public sector and partnered with the private sector — yes , on this day even our competitors , will join us to celebrate the most important public health intervention in the world .
What it takes , and again , where the private sector can make a huge difference , is to come up with a lot of creative thinking that leads support .
If you take our &quot; Help Child &apos;s Help 5 &quot; &quot; campaign , we &apos;ve created great films that bring the message that washing hands with soap to the simple citizen in the way that it can connect .
We had over 30 million views .
Most of these discussions still exist online .
I urge you to take five minutes and watch these films .
I come from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
I grew up in a family where every conversation at dinner was about social justice .
I studied at the leading school in Europe for public health .
I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with a degree in health and the only one who did a Ph.D. on washing hands with soap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful career in public health emergent , that I could make the biggest change in selling and marketing the best product in public health : soap .
Today we run the largest hand-washing program in the world at all the standards about public health .
We &apos;ve reached a factory for 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambition to get to a billion by 2020 .
For the last four years , business has been increasing in a double-digit number , while child mortality has gone down in all places where soap use has grown .
Maybe it &apos;s not pleasant for people to hear but growth in business and saving lives has somehow been compared in the same sentence — but this growth in business is allowing us to keep doing more .
Without it , and without talking about it , we can &apos;t get the change we need .
Last week , my team and I spent visiting mothers who had experienced the same thing : babies who had just been born .
I &apos;m a mother . I can &apos;t imagine something stronger and more painful .
This mother is Myanmar .
She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you get a second chance .
Her son , Mo , he built the other one .
She had a daughter who had been monitored at three weeks , and we know that most of the children who die from Tunisia for the first month of their lives , and we know that if we bring soap to every child and if we use soap before we touch the babies , we can reduce and change in terms of those numbers .
And this is what inspires me , inspires me to continue on this task , to know that I can hunt it in what it takes to be able to do the most beautiful work in the world : to cultivate a baby .
And next time you think about a gift to a young mother and her family , don &apos;t look very far : buy her soap .
The most wonderful invention of public health .
I hope you &apos;ll join us and make your hand drops part of your life and some of our everyday lives and help kids like Mo get to the fifth birthday .
Thank you .

These are the things that the victims of the genocide in Bosnia carried with in the last trip .
And it &apos;s certainly the biggest grave that has been revealed so far .
Over the course of the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , about 30,000 people , especially citizens , disappeared , and the assumption is that we were killed , and 100,000 others were killed during the vicinity .
The National Director House shattered a number of lawyers about crime against humanity and genocide .
In the measure that genocide is killing .
It &apos;s also the destruction of the killing property , of their cultural heritage , and finally , the extinction of every male that has ever existed .
A genocide is not just killing ; it &apos;s denial of identity .
There are always traces — there &apos;s no perfect crime .
There are always remains of those who have been extinct that their resilience is greater than their fragile body resistance and their ambiguous image of our selective time .
There is no one body to remain naked or unidentified .
Once they got together , these items , that the victims carried their way to their executives get a rigorous cleaning , for testing , for catalog and for storage .
Thousands of items are packaged in hotels to build just like these in CSA series .
Occasionally , you invite the survivors to try to identify these items inevitably , but the uncharted observation is extremely difficult , and it &apos;s an inefficient and painful process .
Once the PEC experts , the doctors and the clinics ended up with these items , they become the contributors of this story .
Many of them are destroyed , believe it or not , or just lying on shelves , far from the eye and far from the heart .
I want more than to inspire awareness .
The photo is meant to inspire empathy , and the recognition of these items promises empathy .
Once all the missing ones are identified , there will only be these sacred carcasses in their careers and everyday objects .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;d like to show you something I &apos;m working on .
There are some things that I learned when I did my 30-day challenges .
It was part of the challenge I did to take a picture every day of the month .
I &apos;ve never been so adventurous .
It &apos;s terrible .
In fact , they &apos;re really fun .
( Applause )
Hello , today I &apos;m going to share with you some work that I &apos;m doing today .
Since we &apos;re still learning the works , we &apos;re mostly operating in the field of intuition and mystery , right now .
I &apos;m going to try to describe some of the experiences that we aspire to in each of these works .
The first job is called Impernial Monoches .
A visitor walks into the room and sees these plates in a messy state on the wall .
In seconds , as if the nurses felt in the presence of the controller , and they were supposedly confused and arranged in my body order .
( Laughter ) This is a two-state sketch .
One is completely chaotic and the other is in complete order .
We were interested in looking at how a change is small enough to move from one state to another .
It also reminded us of two very different traditions in the painting .
One is the 15th-century altar plates , and the other one from about 100 years ago , the abstract pieces of Bilgie .
Now I &apos;m going to show you a video .
To give you an idea of scale . The biggest plate is about two feet high .
It &apos;s about that . And the smallest one is A4 .
The controller goes into space , and they go to red .
After a while , if the controller continues to stay in space , the plates become kind of resistant to the presence of the controller and repeat to be authorized and independent , until they again feel comfortable or in motion in the room , and then they will move back to the blood again .
( Laughter ) It seems like the controller is that it stimulates the sense of order in the plates , but it can also be the opposite , which is , the plates are stuck in their fine-tuned behaviors and they dress up on the controller &apos;s role .
This leads me to a smaller , quieter work called handheld holding .
The viewer sees a sheet of paper glue on the far end of the wall , but when you zoom in , you see that it &apos;s a 24-type empty sheet , or something like that , held on two sides of two small arms that look like they were carved in a lot of investment and a lot of little piece of wood .
The viewer also sees that all this leaf is moving a little bit , as if these hands are trying to hold the paper in a stable state for a long time , and they &apos;re not doing so well .
Instability is very similar to the unstable nature of images taken by hand cameras .
Now I &apos;m going to show you two follow-up videos .
One is from a stationary camera and the other one from a handshake .
And you immediately see how the unstable nature of the video suggests the presence of a viewer and a subjective perspective .
Now we downloaded the camera and moved it into a board itself .
Here &apos;s the video .
Imagine the other hand . It &apos;s still not there .
But we , as if we &apos;re trying to induce a self-effectiveness , as if there &apos;s a little person with hands rooted behind this big piece of paper .
This represents the size of the encrypted effort for the viewer to show the paper in front of him while holding his hands .
Next job is a lure .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about my height .
It has a twisted body , two arms , and a very high-headed antenna , and its only purpose is to attract attention .
When somebody walks by it , they swoop off the side , and they move their arms in increasing wilderness as the person gets closer .
So here &apos;s a test case .
You see the two movements in the integration , and the object looks like a user in all its formation to its determination , but the idea is .
Once he gets attention , he loses interest and seeks the next person to win his attention .
( Laughter ) This is the final form of the lure body .
It looks like a mass maker came out of a factory like dust pumps and washing machines .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re always working out of a very personal space , we like how the customer design makes the object unpersonal and gives us a distance , to the least in its head .
So for us it &apos;s a negative manufacturing that tries to divert us from the things that really require our attention , but it can also be a character that needs help .
Next job is an object , which is also a kind of sound recording device .
In the form of amphitheater , which is the size of corresponding to an audience as it looks from the stage .
Where I stand , each of you looks this size , and the audience fills up my entire field of view .
In this audience there are 96 little characters .
They &apos;re mechanically capable of applauding their free desires .
That means that each of them can decide whether and when they want to clap , how powerful and how long they want to be influenced by others in their environment or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
So when the viewer moves in front of the audience , there will be a response .
It can be a single applause or a powerful applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and then again the audience will react .
It could be anything that &apos;s weak than the people in the audience , or it could be a level return .
So we look at the audience as an independent body or an independent organism that also has a kind of musical ability , a kind of instrument .
The viewer can play by producing sound patterns or rather complex musical notes , but it can &apos;t be helpful in the audience any particular reaction .
So it involves feelings of judgment , fitness and discomfort .
It also has a feature of temptation , a kind of trap like this .
Here you can see that we &apos;re excited about the head splitting and creating two hands .
Here &apos;s a brief animation , like the two sides of the brain collide together to actually express the two and the tension .
Here &apos;s the prototype .
We no longer have patience to wait for 96 of them to be expected .
This is the last job . It &apos;s called the FraSwideners .
It &apos;s the product of the idea of a window .
This is a real window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made of three different thickness of pieces of wood .
We used the same recipe of a window to build a framing framework with sources that depend on the room and can be seen on both sides .
This framework is populated with a collection of small figures .
They come in three sizes , to give a sense of perspective or of land drivers on a plane .
Each of the characters can move backwards or forwards in the trajectory and hide between two hidden paths .
In contrast to this very rigid framework , we wanted to give these characters a very hygienic and like a puppet-like character , as if a puppetry took them and nurtured them in life .
We love the idea that these characters jumping into them like this , as if they &apos;re insensitive to the environment , lack of fear , complacency and smuggling the part , until they feel in motion on the viewer and then they hide behind the nearest wall .
For us , this work represents its own internal contradiction .
These characters are kind of trapped inside this difficult framework , which is like a prison house , but also a safe concentration , because it also allows them to be worthless and indifferent to the outside world .
All of these characteristics from the real world I &apos;ve been talking about have been translated into a very particular technical configuration , and we &apos;re lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
They took off our anonymity wheels and made fluctuations that combined the head-tail-down movement and the back-to-back movement .
It &apos;s a pretty small school .
And you can see that it goes into my palm .
So think about what excitement we had when we saw it actually works in the studio .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
When I studied in college , I did a degree in government , which means I had to write a lot of jobs .
Well , when a regular student writes a job , it might divide the work about the following way .
So , you know — ( Laughter ) You start usually slowly , but you can do enough in the first week so that even with a few days later , all the work gets done and things stay calm . ( Laughter )
And I really would like to do things like this .
It &apos;s supposed to be the plan .
I was ready to start by the program , but then , actually , it would come the work , and I did pretty much the next thing .
( Laughter ) And it would happen in every job I had to serve .
But then came my thesis work , 90 pages old , a document that you should be working on for a whole year .
And I knew that for this kind of work , there &apos;s no way to work in my normal method .
It was too big a project .
So I designed everything , and I decided I would take the next method .
This is what it should look like this year .
I &apos;m going to start with sounds , and in the months that I &apos;ll give some gas , and then , towards the end , I &apos;m going to step into high yield , just like a little staircase .
How hard is it supposed to be , going up the stairs ?
Not a big story , right ?
But then , a funny thing happened .
The first months are that ?
They just came and went , and I couldn &apos;t really do anything .
So I came up with a really upgraded and cool program .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) But then , those two months of middle just passed by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and eventually I found myself here .
And then two months turned them into one month , which became two weeks .
And one day I woke up with three days to the guidance date , and because I still didn &apos;t write a word , I did the only thing I could do : I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours , appealing not to one white nights , but two white nights — humans shouldn &apos;t attract two white nights — I crossed the campus in a bathed pond , picked up a slow motion and served the job exactly in time .
I thought that &apos;s where the story ended .
But a week later I got a call from college .
And they say to me , &quot; &quot; I got to Tim Orben ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis work . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And then they say , &quot; This is the best thesis work we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This — didn &apos;t happen . ( Laughter )
It was a really bad job , but really bad . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy one moment , when you all thought to yourself , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was a very bad job .
Anyway , today I &apos;m a guy writing blogs online .
I write the blog : Wait Bret from Why .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about procrastinations .
My behavior has always revolutionized the non-procrastinators around me , and I wanted to explain to all the unprocrastinated in the world , what &apos;s going on inside Dawn &apos;s head , and why we behave as we behave .
Well , I had a hypothesis , that the brains of procrastinators are actually different from other people &apos;s brains .
And to put that hypothesis into the test , I found an MRI lab that agreed that I would scan my brain and another person &apos;s brain , which is unproven , so I could compare them to each other .
And I brought them here today to show you .
I want you to test them for a moment fundamentally and see if you notice the difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained neuroscientist , it &apos;s not that simple , but I want you to try . Okay ?
So , here we see an unimaginable brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) Well , there &apos;s a difference .
Both brains have rational decision-making , but in the mind of the delay there is also the immediate skepticism .
So , what does that mean for the swimmer ?
Well , that means everything is fine — until it happens .
&#91; It &apos;s just time to go to work . &#93; &#91; No , it &apos;s not ! &#93; The rational decision-making will make the rational decision to do something useful , but the monkey doesn &apos;t like this program . So he takes over the wheel , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , let &apos;s read the whole Wikipedia page about Nancy Craig and Tonya Harding , because I just remembered it once happened .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll go to the refrigerator , see if something has been regenerated there in the last 10 minutes .
We &apos;ll then go into the YouTube lab that starts in the videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends a lot , much later when we watch interviews with Justin Bieber &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) All of this is going to take quite a while , so we don &apos;t really have a place to do any job .
&quot; Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Asking ) So what &apos;s going on here ?
The immediate skeptical monkey doesn &apos;t look like someone you &apos;d like behind the wheel .
It &apos;s totally alive at this moment .
It doesn &apos;t have a past memory , it &apos;s not aware of the future , and it only cares about two things : easy and fun .
Now , in the animal world , it works beautifully .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing easy and fun things , then you &apos;ve succeeded in life !
( Laughter ) And for the monkey , humans are just another animal species .
All you have to do is sleep well , eat well , put offspring , things that in the age when we lived in tribes , really matched us .
But , in case you haven &apos;t noticed — we &apos;re no longer in our tribal age .
We live in an advanced culture , and the monkey has no idea what that means .
And that &apos;s why we have another person in the brain , this guy — rational decision-making , that allows us to do things that no other animal can do .
We can see the future in our minds .
We can see the big picture .
We can design long-term programs .
And we want to take all of these into account .
And he wants to make us do what he seems rational to do right now .
Well , sometimes it really makes sense to do what &apos;s easy and fun , like when you eat dinner or you go to sleep or enjoy a long time when you &apos;ve earned joy .
This is the area where we have an overlap .
Sometimes , they agree with each other .
But sometimes , it makes a lot more sense to do difficult and less pleasant things , to promote the big picture .
And that &apos;s where we have disagreement .
And for the clarity , this disagreement tends to end in the same way every time , makes it spend a lot of time in this orange area , an easy and fun place that &apos;s completely outside the logic circle .
I call this place the Apple Games gene .
( Laughter ) Now , the dark game gene is a place where all the procrastinators , in your right , are very familiar .
This is where the leisure activities happen , at times when leisure activities are not supposed to happen .
The fun you &apos;re experiencing in the dark game gene , it &apos;s not really fun , because you &apos;ve totally not earned it , and the air there is profoundly guilty , horror , anxiety , self-hatred — all the known , well-known , procrastinary feelings .
And the question is , in this situation , when the monkey is the concentration of leadership , how can the delay get itself here at all , to this blue area , a place that is much less nice , but where does the important things really matter ?
Well , it turns out that Darwin has a guarantee angel , somebody who always talks about and keeps his steps in the toughest moments — someone called the Choir monster .
( Laughter ) Now , the panic monster is sleeping most of the time , but suddenly wakes up every time a last target for doing work comes too close or there &apos;s a danger to be embarrassed in the public , as-career , or some other threatening outcome .
And most importantly , it &apos;s the only thing that a monkey is afraid of .
Well , it became very relevant in my life , just recently , because TED people contacted me about six months ago and invited me to give a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Now , obviously I said yes .
It was always my dream , knowing that I had a TED Talk before .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But as all this excitement , it seems that the rational decision gets to think about something else .
He told me , &quot; &quot; Tell me , do we understand what we &apos;ve got on ourselves right now ?
Do we get what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We &apos;ve got to sit down and start working on this now . And the monkey said , &quot; &quot; Absolutely agree with you , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth for a moment and focus on the sacrifice of the Indian subcontinent , about 200 feet above the surface , and then release the mouse north for two and a half hours until we get to the north of the country , so we can get a better sense of India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
Six months became four , and then two months and then a month , and the TED people decided to publish the speaker list .
And I opened the site and there — my face appeared , and I had a look back at me .
And guess who woke up then ?
( Laughter ) So the panic monster started losing smokes and a few seconds later , the whole system was chaos . ( Laughter )
And the monkey — you know , he &apos;s terrified of the panic monster — boom ! He leaped to the top of the tree .
And finally , the rational decision-making can take a function and I can start working on the lecture .
Now , the panic monster story can explain all kinds of unexpected kinds of procrastinary behavior , like how someone like me can spend two full weeks without even writing an open sentence , and then in a miracle to find the self-discipline to stay awake for a whole night to write eight pages .
And this whole situation that I described to the god , with the three characters — this is what happens in Dawn &apos;s head .
It &apos;s not a pleasant play , but ultimately , it works .
This is what I decided to write in the blog a few years ago .
And when I wrote , I was amazed by the responses .
I got thousands of email messages , from all sorts of people all over the world , dealing with all kinds of things .
There were sisters , bankers , painters , engineers , and lots of Ph.D.
( Laughter ) And they all wrote the same thing : &quot; I suffer from the same problem exactly . &quot;
But what struck me was the contrast between the audio atmosphere of the post and the respect of the email response messages .
These people wrote out of a huge frustration and told about what procrastinations were going on for their lives , about what this monkey was going on .
And I thought about it and I said to myself , if the system of the lawsuit works well , then what &apos;s going on here ?
Why are all these people in such a dark place ?
So it turns out there are two types of procrastinations .
All I &apos;ve been talking about today , all the examples I gave , all of which have been a destination date .
And when there &apos;s a documentation , the effects of procrastinators exist in the short term , because the panic is mixed .
But there &apos;s another kind of procrastination that works in cases where there &apos;s no destination date .
So if you want a career that you &apos;re driving yourself — something in art , something entrepreneurial — there &apos;s no documentation that I started these things , because nothing happens at first , until you get up and decide to do the hard work of getting the momentum , of moving things around .
There are all sorts of important things beyond your career that don &apos;t involve any targets , like seeing with your family , exercising or taking care of your health , cultivating your relationship or getting out of a connection that doesn &apos;t work .
Now , if the only mechanism of the commander to do these difficult things is the panic monster , then there &apos;s a problem , because in all these situations , there &apos;s no date date , the panic monster doesn &apos;t appear .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to wake up , so the impacts of procrastination don &apos;t die . They just stretch forever .
And this is this kind of procrastination , over the long term that is less visible and less of it than the short-term and funny kind , based on a destination date .
And normally it &apos;s silently and private .
And it can be the source of an enormous amount of misery and regret over the long term .
And I thought to myself , this is why all the email messages that people sent to me , and so they &apos;re in such a bad place .
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re now deaf towards some project .
The long-term procrastination made them transparent , in their own lives .
The frustration is not because they couldn &apos;t fulfill their dreams , but because they weren &apos;t able to even start pursuing them .
So I read these email messages and I had a little epiphany — I don &apos;t think there are any nephews at all .
That &apos;s right — I think you &apos;re all procrastinators .
Now , you may not be a mess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you have a healthy relationship with destination dates , but remember : the dirty exercise of the monkey is when the target dates are not there .
Now , I want to show you one last thing .
I call it a life-threatening .
There &apos;s one box for every week in life that &apos;s 90 years old .
Not so many boxes in total , especially in light of the fact that we &apos;ve already used some of them .
So I think we all need to direct a long , follow-up view of this day .
We need to think about the things that we procrastinate for , because each of us takes a procrastination about something in life .
We need to stay aware of the immediate skeptical monkey .
This is our mission , of all of us .
And because there aren &apos;t so many boxes there , it &apos;s a task that we should probably start right now .
Well , maybe not quite today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sometime soon .
Thank you .
( Applause )
It &apos;s all the other way around us , right ?
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
That &apos;s why the army draws them .
It turned out to me that the environment is determined , and if the environment is right , each and every one of us has the ability to do these amazing things , and more importantly , others have this ability .
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And everyone had the same answer : &quot; Because they would do it for me . &quot;
The problem with concepts like trust and cooperation , is that they are emotions and not instructions .
I can &apos;t just tell you , trust me .
So , where does this emotion come from ?
It wasn &apos;t personal .
They have benefits .
A bad system of survival .
These can be the tide and the replicator in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
There &apos;s no control over these forces .
So I opened my mouth .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you treat us as a herd ?
The reason we like to fly at Southwest Airlins is not necessarily because they employ better people .
It &apos;s because the people there are not afraid of their leaders .
They want to give people an opportunity , an education , an discipline when you need to , develop your own confidence , give them opportunities to try and fail , so that they can get more of us and more than we want for ourselves .
Never .
That &apos;s the exact opposite .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s the fact that they violated the very definition of leadership .
They violated this ancient social contract .
We know that they let their people fall on their interests , or worse , really sacrifice their people so they can keep their interests .
It &apos;s the thing that so hits us , not the numbers .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save the numbers .
They had to save 10 million dollars , so like many companies these days , the principal member came in and discussed the fired issue .
All the workers , from the Secretary to the CEO , had to go out for four unpaid leave weeks .
But the way Bob announced the program was that it was so significant .
They saved 20 million dollars , and more importantly , as you can expect when people feel secure and protected by the leadership of the organization , the natural response is to trust and collaborate .
Those who could afford to replace with those who could less afford it .
People went out for five weeks on vacation , so somebody else could just go out to three .
Leadership is a choice , not gradually .
These are leaders .
We call these people leaders because they step in the head .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before everyone else .
We call them leaders because they will always choose to sacrifice themselves so that their people are safe and protected , and for their people to come out of jail , and when we do that , the natural response will be that our people will sacrifice for us .
They &apos;ll give us blood , sweat and tears to predict the visions of a leader , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why did you do that ?
The most complex problems of our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we can dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to transferring dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Thereses Tahler , a Jewish refugee who sat at the heart of the Andes Mountains .
And so I grew up , I was raised to see beyond any limitation .
Some of my education has even helped my grandmother in remote indigenous communities .
I remember them in love , because they helped me understand life outside the city , living with many possibilities , without barriers , like language or culture .
During those journeys , my grandmother used to quote a Kepling song : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and search it .
&quot; &quot; Go and look beyond the mountains .
&quot; &quot; Something is lost beyond the mountains .
&quot; Lost and wait for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the next few years , I started studying medicine .
One in 100 children in the world were born with some heart disease .
And there &apos;s part of the problem that I can solve — part of the problem that I &apos;ve dedicated to my life .
The problem begins during pregnancy .
The fetus have to survive in the womb of his mother .
His survival depends on the connection between the periodic and arbitrary blood system .
At the moment of birth , this connection has to be blocked .
If it &apos;s not warmed , the baby will have a hole in the heart .
It &apos;s a situation caused by displays and genetic factors .
But now we know that oxygen shortage also leads to a problem .
As you can see in the chart , the prevalence of the hole in the heart is dramatically rising in high places .
Video : ( Baby crying ) When you see patients like this , they seem to be desperate in the air .
In order to close the hole , they used to do large heart surgeries .
One night , my friend Melta and I , we set up a camp in the Amazon area .
The only material that didn &apos;t burn in fire was green dodo limbs .
And then we were inspired .
And we used the tokardo branches as a pattern for our first invention .
It &apos;s meant to block the hole at the heart of the babies .
A coil is a piece of metal that &apos;s surrounded by itself .
Maybe it doesn &apos;t seem impressive right now , but it was our first successful attempt to build a medical device to solve the problem .
In the video , you can see a tiny piano inserting the coil to the heart .
And then the coil blocks the hole .
After that moment of inspiration , it took a huge effort to develop a prototype .
Experiments in the lab and animals took us thousands of hours of work in the lab .
The coil , if it works , will save lives .
I came back from Germany to Bolivia , and I thought everywhere we go , we could affect the better .
With my wife and collaborators , Dr. Alexandra Heather , we started looking at patients .
After we successfully treated patients with the coil , we were really excited .
But we live in a place that &apos;s three and a half kilometers high .
And the patients there need a special device to solve their heart problems .
Most patients can &apos;t afford time treatment , and they die .
Our first helix only treated half the patients in Bolivia .
We started looking again .
We went back to the desks .
After many attempts , and with my grandparents &apos; indigenous friends living in the mountains , we created a new device .
For hundreds of years , indigenous women have told stories by weaving complicated examples in caring banks , and this unique ability has helped us in the new development .
We used the traditional fabrication method to design a smart materials machine that learns shapes .
It seems that this time , the fabric will allow us to make a device without any seams that &apos;s not insulating because it &apos;s made of one unit .
And it changes its shape alone for complex forms in the process that has evolved for centuries .
As you can see , the device is transmitted into the body through the blood vessel .
The doctors only need to put the piano through the hole .
Our device expands , self-assembles and closes the hole .
We have an amazing , easy-to-use Hollywood system because it works itself .
And you don &apos;t need open heart surgery .
( Applause ) As doctors , we fight diseases that take a long time to cure — if we can cure them .
This is the child we saw before , after the treatment was passed .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is located , the patient is 100 percent healthier .
From the beginning to the end , the whole process only takes 30 minutes .
It &apos;s very satisfying with the medical and human test .
We &apos;re proud of people we &apos;ve treated are now part of our team — and thanks to the connection between us and our patients .
Together , we have one idea : the optimal solution should be simple .
We &apos;ve lost fear of creating something new .
The road wasn &apos;t easy .
A lot of obstacles emerged all the time .
But we got power from our patients .
Their resilience and courage inspired us .
Our goal is to make sure that there is no child who is not treated , not because of price or access to treatment .
So we have to set up a foundation in one model for one .
We &apos;re going to give an free device to make sure that all children are treated .
We work in many countries today , but we need to be everywhere .
It all started with an impossible idea that would keep us assumed : every child would get care .
Thank you .

I grew up in Philadelphia , in a border between leftofu and Mapuleaga , in a small town called Montema .
The water supply and electricity was unpredictable like the weather , and when I grew up there in these harsh conditions , at 17 , I used to spend some of my friends in the winter , and we &apos;d be sharing the sun .
The sun of Limpo is very hot in the winter .
So as we got better , my good friend , next to me , says , &quot; &quot; Come on , why don &apos;t nobody invent anything that can escape the skin and then don &apos;t have to blow ? &quot; &quot; I sat there and I said , &quot; &quot; Come on . I &apos;d buy this thing . &quot; &quot; I went home and did a little research , and I found some very shocking data .
More than 2.5 billion people in the world today have no access to water and sanitation .
450 million of them live in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
In this environment , they thrive in all sorts of diseases , where the bulk of them is called grain .
Gardening is eye pollution because of an ear that &apos;s wiped into the eye , a few grain infections are able to blind you forever .
The disease turns eight million people into the blind every year , and the most shocking part of it is that in order to prevent nuclear pollution you have to just wash faces : no drugs , no pills , no injections .
So after I saw these staggering data , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Even if not for myself , because I don &apos;t have to hack , I should at least try to do it to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my lovely working horse , my mobile phone 6234 , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , and not a lot of Internet , except the Internet at 20 Rand an hour — I did a research on Wikipedia , a little bit of Google .
And it &apos;s like the special sauce of Kentucky Friedman , right ?
So I had a formula ready .
And now we have to make it practical .
Four forward four years , after writing a business plan of 40 pages on the mobile phone , and also my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent in the country , and — &quot; &quot; Double ! &quot; &quot; — I can &apos;t add anything to that . ( Laughter ) I invented Draviv , which is the world &apos;s first runaway alternative .
You just put it on the skin , and you don &apos;t have to run .
( Laughter ) After trying to do this in high school with my limited resources then , I went to university , met with some people , I made it practical , and today we have a completely functional product , ready to go into the market . It &apos;s already available on the market .
We &apos;ve learned some lessons in commercial and how to offer Draviv .
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in large quantities .
They buy products by demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a cigarette box , but a single cigarette every day , even if it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged Draviv in these new markets .
You just break them in half , and you crush .
And what &apos;s nice is , one block is a substitute for a shower in five Rand .
After we created this model , we learned a lot more about using the product .
We also realized that rich kids from suburbs want Draviv . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average , every time they don &apos;t succeed , and we also save two hours a day in children in rural areas , which are two more hours in school , two more hours for homework , two more hours just to be children .
After we saw the global impact , we took it to the central value of our business plan , which is cleaning and convenient .
For the rich , Draviv is convenient and poor — saving lives .
After we put that product into work , we &apos;re actually ready to sell the product in a multinational organization to get into the retail market , and the only question I have today to the audience is , in the gravel roads of Limpo , with the 50 Rand per week , I invented for the world a method of how to not run .
What &apos;s driving you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
Another key thing I learned a lot about during this whole process , a year ago Google recognized me as one of the world &apos;s brilliant young minds .
Today I am also the best student in the world , the first African to get this aura , and what really amazes me is , I did all this just because I didn &apos;t want to blow . Thank you .

Five years ago , I was in a sabbatical , and I went back to medical school where I learned .
I got real patients and wore the white coat for the first time 17 years , actually , since I became a management consultant .
There were two things that surprised me the month I was there .
The first was that the dominant premise of our discussions was around hospital budgets and downloading costs , and the second , and it really troubled me , was some of my colleagues , whom I met , former medical school members , who I knew as some of the smartest , motivated people , the most enthusiastic and passionate people I knew , many of whom became officials , disconnected or removed from hospitals .
So when we focus on the explosion of costs , I asked myself , do we forget the patients ?
Many countries that you represent , and also the one that I &apos;ve come from , are struggling with health care costs .
This is a big component in the national budgets .
And many reforms try to stop the tumor in them .
In some countries , we have extended recipients of patients , surgeries .
In other countries , there &apos;s no coverage on new medicines , so they don &apos;t get to the hospital .
In some countries , doctors and nurses are the culprits , to some extent , in the eyes of government .
After all , the precious decisions in health care are accepted by doctors and nurses .
You &apos;re the ones who choose to do expensive lab test , you &apos;re the ones who choose to analyze some old , fragile patient .
So limiting doctors &apos; freedom of action is a way to keep low costs .
And eventually , some doctors will say today that they have no full-time choice to make decisions that they think fit their patients .
So it &apos;s no wonder that some of my colleagues are frustrated .
In the Boston advisory group , we tested this , and we asked ourselves , it &apos;s not possible that this is the right way to run a healthcare system .
So we step back and said , &quot; What is the thing we &apos;re trying to achieve ? &quot;
Eventually , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re trying to improve health for patients , and we need to do it at a finite or affordable cost .
We call it value-based health care .
On the screen behind me you see what I mean by &quot; &quot; value &quot; &quot; : outcomes that are considered in terms of patients compared to the money that we spend .
This is incredibly described in the book since 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Tesberg .
In this picture you see Himi , and around his three beautiful daughters .
When we started our research at the Boston advisory group , we decided not to deal too much with the costs , but to look at the quality , and in research , one of the things that fascinated us was the differences that we saw .
If you compare hospitals in some country , you &apos;ll find some of them are really good , but you &apos;ll also find a lot of much worse hospitals .
The differences were dramatic .
Eric , warm , suffered from prostate cancer , probably needed surgery .
Because it lives today in Europe , it can travel to Germany that has good reputation health services .
If you go there and go into the average hospital , his chances of losing his burst capacity is about 50 percent , and he &apos;s going to have to start again wearing a cat .
It &apos;s a coin chart . It &apos;s a 50 percent risk . It &apos;s quite a lot .
Instead , if you decide to go to Hamburg , to a clinic called Martin Clinic , the risk will only be one in 20 .
The selection is either a coin , or a one-to-20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven times bigger difference .
When we look at many hospitals about many diseases , we find these huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know that . We don &apos;t have the data .
And often , the data doesn &apos;t exist at all .
Nobody knows .
So choosing in a hospital is the lottery .
It doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There &apos;s hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there was a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who got into their annual encounter , and they discussed the different audiences where they analyzed the hip chapter .
On the left side of the slide you see a variety of pieces of metal , artificial joints that were used for people who needed a new hip chapter .
They met everybody using different analytics .
Each one claimed , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them knew for sure , and they all acknowledged it .
So they said , &quot; &quot; We must measure the quality so that we know what and we can learn from the best . &quot; &quot; And they actually spent two years arguing , &quot; What is quality of surgery in the hip chapter ? &quot;
&quot; We need to measure this thing , &quot; No , we need to measure that thing . &quot;
And eventually they came to consent .
And once they agreed , they started measuring , and they started sharing the data .
They soon found that if you put a needle in fact of the patient , before you put in the metal pole , it actually lasts longer , and most of the patients will never need repetitive surgery in the rest of their lives .
They published the data , and it really changed the face of health care in that country .
Everybody has seen it taste a lot .
Since then , they &apos;ve been published every year .
One year they publish their driving chart : Who &apos;s the best ? Who &apos;s at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to wait , so it &apos;s a constant cycle of improvement .
For many years , the Swedish hip surgeons have achieved the best results in the world , at least for those who have indeed measured performance , and the performance of many have not been measured .
To me , this principle is really exciting .
The doctors come together , they agree with them what quality is , and they start valuing performance , sharing the data , finding who is best and learning from it .
Sustainable improvement .
And this is not the only exciting part .
It &apos;s exciting to itself .
But if you go back and you add the cost aspect of the equation , and you look at it , it turns out that those who focused on quality were actually the lowest cost , even though it wasn &apos;t their goal in the first place .
So if we take the story of a hip minimum analysis , a few years ago there was a study that compared the United States and Sweden .
In the study , we looked at how many patients needed rehearsal surgery in seven years since the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than Sweden .
I mean , a lot of surgical procedures , and so much suffering from more to all the patients that have been developed in those seven years .
You can also understand how saving it could be in terms of society .
We did a study where we looked at the organization &apos;s data for economic collaboration and development .
The ECD occasionally checks the quality of health care to get the country &apos;s data in it .
In the United States , in many diseases , the quality is below the average of the ECD .
If the U.S. healthcare system is going to focus more on quality , and it &apos;s going to increase quality , and even just on the average level of the ECD , it &apos;s going to save the American people 500 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , the national health budget .
You might say these numbers are fantastic , and everything makes sense , but is it possible ?
It would be a paradigm shift in health care , and I would argue that not only is it done , but it &apos;s committed to doing .
Changing leaders are doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
In my work as a consultant , I meet maybe a hundred , or more than 100 doctors , nurses and other medical staff from the health care system every year .
And one thing that everybody has in common is that they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
Doctors , like most of you here in the audience , are very competitive .
They were always the best in the class .
We &apos;ve always been the best in the class .
And if someone can show them that the results of what they do with their patients are not better than others , they will do everything to improve .
But most of them have no idea .
But doctors are characterizing something else .
They &apos;re hard for acknowledging their peers .
If one cardiologist reaches another cardiologist , in a competing hospital , and they discuss why the other hospital gets much better outcomes , they &apos;ll share information .
They will share information that will help achieve improvement .
So , by measuring and creating transparency , you create a cycle of constant improvement , and that &apos;s what this slide shows .
You might say it &apos;s a nice idea , but it &apos;s not just an idea .
It &apos;s happening in reality .
We create a global community , a wide global community , where we can appreciate and compare what we achieve .
Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter from Harvard Business School , and the Carolynska Institute in Sweden , the Boston advisory group set up something called Aichum .
It may sound like a hammer , but it &apos;s not a sneezing , it &apos;s an acronym .
International partnerships are doing health outcomes . International partnerships are assessing health outcomes .
We bring in senior physicians along with patients , and discuss , disease after disease , in a question of really quality , what we need to measure , and act to make these global standards .
They &apos;ve been working — four work groups have been working for the last year : cataract , back pain , mental heart disease , which is , for example , heart attacks , prostate cancer .
The four groups will publish their data in November , this year .
This will be the first time we compare apples to apples , not just in the same country , but between states .
Next year we &apos;re planning to go through eight diseases , the year after 16 .
In three years , we &apos;re planning to cover 40 percent of the number of diseases .
Compare apple apple apple . Who &apos;s better ?
And why ?
Five months ago , I ran a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : &quot; I want to run my big institution much more on a quality basis , on outcomes that are important for patients . &quot;
At that particular day we sat in a workshop , along with doctors , nurses and other staff people , and we discussed blood videos in children .
The group discussed the question , how should we value quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do now ?
We discussed how to treat these children , what are the important improvements ?
And we also discussed costs in terms of these patients , can we take care of them more effectively ?
There was a great energy hall .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the department chairman stood up .
He looked around the group and he said — first he picked his hand , I forgot it — he picked his hand , grabbed his ego , and he told the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
&quot; &quot; Thank you . Today we finally discuss what this hospital is doing right . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in the health care system , not just financial value , but results that are important to patients , we will turn the staff of hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not to the problem , but an important part of the solution .
I believe that measuring value in the healthcare system will revolutionize , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient in the center , will smile in the grave .
Thank you .

I &apos;m really excited to share with you some findings that really surprised me about what makes companies succeed , what causes actually change the most to start-ups success .
I believe that the start-up organization is one of the best forms to make the world a better place .
If you take a group of people with the right financial incentive and organize them into startup , you release human potential in a way that has never been possible before .
You make them achieve things that are unbelievable .
But if the start-up organization is so great , why are so many of them failing ?
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually matters most to the success of startups .
And I wanted to try to be systematic about this , avoid some of my instincts and maybe misconcepts that I have in so many companies that I &apos;ve seen over the years .
I wanted to know this because I started businesses since I was 12 when I sold soap in the middle school bus stop , up to high school , when I made solar power devices , college , when I made speakers .
And when I got out of college , I started software companies .
And 20 years ago , I started IDallab , and in the last 20 years , we started over 100 companies , many successful companies , and many great failures .
We &apos;ve learned a lot of these failures .
So I tried to look across what factors most affect the successes and failures of companies .
So I looked at these five .
First , the idea .
I used to think the idea was everything .
I called my girlfriend Idilov because of how I appreciate the &quot; &quot; Aha ! &quot; &quot; when you first get the idea up .
But then over time , I started to think that maybe the team , the performance , the adaptability , were even more significant than the idea .
I never thought I &apos;d quote Make Tyson on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , until they get a mad in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business .
So much about doing this team is the ability to adapt to get trumped inside by the client .
The customer is the real reality .
And so I thought the team might be the most important thing .
So I started looking at the business model .
Do society have a clear path to create profit from customers ?
It started to come up thinking about what might really matter the most to success .
So I looked at finance .
Sometimes companies get large amounts of funding .
Is that the most important thing ?
And then of course , the timing .
Is the idea too early and the world not ready for that yet ?
Is it early , which means , you &apos;re ahead and you have to educate the world ?
So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies .
And I was looking across all 100 Idilov companies , and 100 non-ideal companies to try and get to something scientific about it .
So first of all , on these ideal firms , the five good companies — Siftsch , Karazeirk , Goto , Natasho , Tits.com — all of these have become a billion-dollar success .
And the five companies at the bottom — Z.com , Infinder Fijes , May Leyph , Ph.D. , Philippe — we all had big hopes for them , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
So I tried to upgrade all these traits how I felt that these companies were rating on this one of these dimensions .
And then for companies that don &apos;t have an idialab , I looked at wild successes , like Air Bye &amp; Be and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
And some failures : Webvan , Kosomo , P.com , Florence and Ferndster .
Companies at the bottom were serious funding , they even had a business model in some cases , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to look at what causes actually were the most important for success and failure across these companies , and the results really surprised me .
The first thing was timing .
The timing was 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
The team and performance was number two , and the idea , the difference in the idea , the uniqueness of the idea , actually came to the third place .
Now , it &apos;s not entirely defined , it doesn &apos;t mean the idea isn &apos;t important , but it really surprised me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important idea .
Sometimes it changed more than when it was actually timed .
The last two , a business model and finance model , actually made sense to me .
The company went right at the top of the recession when people really needed more money , and it might help people overcome their resistance to hiring their home to strangers .
Same thing with Uber .
The drivers were looking for extra money ; it was very , very important .
Some of the early successes , Sitch , came when people needed pages online .
Gotost.com , which we actually announced at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for effective economic ways to get traffic .
We thought the idea was great , but actually , the timing was probably more important .
And then some of our failures .
We started a company called Z.com , it was a online entertainment company .
It was too difficult to watch online video content , you had to install cracks in your browser and do all of that , and the company finally simplified the leg in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the crack problem was solved with Abdi Flash and the broad default room went 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly timed .
Great idea , but unbelievable timing .
In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when they started .
The idea matters a lot .
But timing matters even more .
And the best way to really value timing is to really understand if consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them .
Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a wonderful audience .

I succeeded in school . The expectations of me were high , and in a great joy I walked into the student world of lectures , parties and stealing sandwiches on the side of the road .
Within me I was very unhappy , insecure and scared — scared by people , from the future , from failure and the hurricanes that I felt inside me .
I came out of a lecture when it started , inviting myself , engaging with the bag , just like I did hundreds of times before , when suddenly I heard that tiny voice quietly , &quot; She leaves the room . &quot;
I looked around , and I didn &apos;t see anybody in the environment , but there was no mistake in the diving and the resolution of the comment .
&quot; She opens the door . &quot;
That was the beginning . The voice came .
And he stayed , days and then weeks , again and again , describing everything I do in the third body .
&quot; She &apos;s going to lecture . &quot;
He was neutral , emotionally abandoned and even after a while , my friends and reassuring in a strange way , even though I noticed that his worst exoskeleton sometimes falls down and that sometimes he reflects an unexpressed emotion of mine .
So , for example , if I was angry and I wanted to hide this , which I often did , being very trained in probing my real emotions , then the sound would sound frustrated .
From a subtle process of planning , understanding that normal people don &apos;t hear sounds and the fact that I did hear , meant that something was very wrong .
I spent quite a while telling the college doctor .
And in fact , I desperately needed a colony ear and help . I started telling him about my strange vocal accompanion .
For example , I was involved in a TV channel of students who transmitted new screens in campus , and during a meeting with him who came back , I said , &quot; &quot; Sorry , but I have to go .
From that point of events were quickly discovered without having control over them .
The hospitalization in the hospital , the first of many , then the diagnosis of schizophrenia , and then , the worst of all , a toxic and devastating sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my chances .
But because I was encouraged to look at the voice not as an experience , but as a symptom , my concerns and my resistance were overcoming .
But essentially , all of this was a sign of taking an aggressive position towards my mind , a kind of mental civil war , and all of this caused an increase in the number of voices that gradually became more hostile and threatening .
You see the glass of water ?
In fact , there was a vicious cycle of fear , disappearance , lack of trust and lack of understanding , and it was a war where I felt helpless and unable to reach peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , the decline was an outlier .
Now I had the full repertoire of madness : scary voices , distorted visions , strange and uncontrolled hallucinations .
Today , looking back at the despair and the destruction of those years , it seems to me like someone died in that place , and yet someone else was saved .
A broken man and a spirit spirit started this journey , but the person who grew up from it was a survivor that would eventually grow up to be the person I was intended to be .
A lot of people hit me in my life , and all of them I remember , but a bloody and weak male compared to the people who did help me .
I believe Eleanor will overcome this .
Sometimes , it snow even in May , but at the end of the summer it &apos;s always coming . &quot; &quot; 14 minutes are not enough to fully recognize the work of good , generous people who fought with me and for me and waiting to get my face in my back from that single , moral place .
First it was very difficult to believe in it , not a little bit because the voices were so hostile and threatening , and so in that aspect , the first essential step was to learn to discriminate the metaphorical meaning from what I had previously interpreted as a truth , simple as meaning .
So for example , voices that were threatened to attack my home , I learned to interpret as the expression of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than a real threat .
At first , I would believe them .
For example , I remember staying awake at night near my parents &apos; room to keep them from what I thought he was a real threat from the voices .
Like I said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t deal with me .
I have a plastic fork , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; &quot; I was really strategic .
So , equipped with this knowledge , I finally managed to reconnect my crushed self , when each piece of it was represented by a different voice , I gradually got rid of all my drugs , and I went back to psychiatry , but this time from the other direction .
Today I &apos;m very proud to be part of Introlux , an international movement organization to hear sounds , an initiative born out of the work of Professor Marrius Ram and Dr. Sandra , who is treating sounds as a survival strategy , as a response to unexpected circumstances , not as a normal symptoms of schizophrenia that needs to be tolerated , but as a meaningful experience that needs to be investigated .
Such a society is not only possible , but it &apos;s already on the way to emerge .
In Praza to Chihuz , once social change starts , you can &apos;t bring it back .
You can &apos;t drop a person who feels proud .
You can &apos;t oppress people who are no longer afraid .
In the last 20 years , the movement for hearing voice has deployed support networks to hear voices in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote self-confidence , solidarity and strengthening people who suffer from mental distress , to create language and new therapy that will provide hope , in a bee the unstoppable beliefs in the power of the person .
As Peter Levin once said , the human animal is a special entity that has been blessed with innate ability to heal and the mental ability to harness this innate capacity .
In this aspect , for the members of the community , there is no dignity or greater privilege than pushing forward the healing process in someone , to be witness , to reach out , to share someone &apos;s suffering channel , to cultivate hope for their recovery .
We &apos;re unique . We don &apos;t have a substitute .
What lies around us cannot be suppressed , distorted or taken .
Light never turned off .
As one wonderful doctor once told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people told you about you .
Tell me about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photographs .
But is it really a photograph ?
Because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t photograph with a camera .
And yet , my interest in photography started when I got my first digital camera at 15 .
It mixed with my previous passion for drawing , but it was a little different , because using camera , the process was in design .
And when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So for me it felt like photography was more like being in the right time in the right place .
I felt like everyone could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
Images like this : a building that happens along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And yet , it keeps a level of realistic .
Or images like these — both of them are dark and colorful , but all of them with a common goal of preserving a realistic level .
And when I say realistic , I mean a topographic reality .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually photograph , but I always want it to look like you could film it somehow as a picture .
Pictures where you need a moment to think to understand the trick .
So it &apos;s more about perception of the idea than just a moment in reality .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look real ?
Is it something in detail or colors ?
Is it something in light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes perspective is the illusion .
But ultimately , it gets to how to interpret the world and how you can fulfill it on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s what we think is really realistic .
So I think the foundation is quite simple .
I just see it as a reality puzzle where you can take different parts of reality and connect them together to create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three completely imaginary bodies , something that we can all understand when we live in a three-dimensional world .
But when you combine them in a way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , as if it can exist .
But at the same time , we know it &apos;s not .
So we control our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make any sense .
And I see the same process with a combination of images .
It &apos;s just a combination of different realities .
So the things that make the picture look realistic , I think that &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in life .
But combined with images , it &apos;s really important to take into account , because otherwise it just seems wrong somehow .
So I &apos;d like to say that there are three simple rules to fill in order to achieve a real result .
As you can see , these pictures are not really unique .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first law is that integrated images have to be the same perspective .
Second , integrated images have to be the same lighting conditions .
And these two pictures fill the two conditions — taken from the same height and the same lighting conditions .
The third is to do this in an unexaminable home where every image starts and ends up by the disappearance of the ceiling .
Make it impossible to say how the picture was assembled .
So by matching color , contrast and clarity in the boundaries between the different images , adding photographic flaws like a field valley , identical colors and noise , we erase the boundaries between the images and make it look like one image , despite the fact that one image can basically contain hundreds of layers .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) You can think it &apos;s just a picture of a landscape and the lower part is a edit .
But this picture is completely composed of images from different places .
I personally think it &apos;s actually easier to create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas you have in your head .
But it requires a lot of planning .
And to get this idea in the winter , I knew I had a few months to design it , to find the different places for pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was taken on a fishing journey .
The beaches are from somewhere else .
The underwater part was shot in a stone hole .
And yes , I even made the house at the top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
So to get a realistic result , I think it comes to design .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
And then it &apos;s to unite the different images .
And this is where every picture is very designed .
And if you do a good job taking pictures , the result can be really beautiful and pretty realistic .
So all the tools are available , and the only thing that constrains us is our imagination .
Thank you .

&#91; In April 3 , we saw the largest data leap in history . &#93; &#91; Panama documents revealed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; who hidden huge amounts of money in accounts outside of the country . &#93; &#91; What does all this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called Robert Palmer Flmer from Glender Vietnes to explain . &#93; This week , there was a whole bunch of stories coming from the leak of 11 million documents from a state-based state-of-the-art piece called Mosentum .
The release of these documents is chimpanzeing up the screen on a tiny piece of the secret money world outside of the country .
We get a glimpse of how customers and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosques Puncca and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we want an anonymous company , can you arrange us one ? &quot; &quot; So in fact you see email , you see the exchange of messages , you see the mechanism of how this works , how it works .
Now , it &apos;s already started to make pretty immediate effects .
The Iceland prime minister quit .
We also have news that the United States of the dictator Syria in the rest of Ed Ed also has accounts outside the country .
There were the accusations of a $ 2 billion cash that leads to the president of Russia and Dimmir Putin through his childhood friend , who happened to be Chileen Super .
And there will be a lot of rich people there and others who will be upset about the next set of stories and the next set of documents .
Now , it sounds like a leaf from a rolling plant or John GreenLaw Nobel .
It looks very remote from you , from me , from ordinary people .
Why should we care about this ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful people are able to keep their money out of the country and not pay taxes that they need , it means that there &apos;s less money for positive public services like health , education , roads .
And it affects all of us .
Now , to my organization Galvell Witness , this exposure was extraordinary .
We have the global media and political leaders talking about how people can use secrets outside the country to hide and end their assets — something we &apos;ve talked about and exposure for a decade .
Now , I think a lot of people find this whole world confusing and disturbing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this kind of world outside the country works .
I like to think of it a little bit like a Russian doll .
So you can have a company within another company , within another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who &apos;s behind these structures .
It can be really hard for law enforcement or tax authorities , for journalists , for civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there was less surveillance of this issue in the United States .
And that might be because some of the most controversial people in the United States just didn &apos;t show up in this exposure , in this scale .
Now , it &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are carrying their assets out of the country .
It &apos;s simply because of the way that assets outside of the country work , Mosques Puncca has fewer American customers .
I think if we saw a leak from May Kamen or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see a lot more cases and examples that connect back to Americans .
In fact , in a number of American countries you need less information , you need to provide less information to create a company than you need to get a library card .
This kind of secrecy allowed workers of school districts to enjoy school children .
It allowed Christians to be vulnerable investors .
It &apos;s the kind of behavior that affects all of us .
Now , in the Witness Bell , we wanted to see what it actually looks like in reality .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we sent a poll to 13 Dean editing companies in Manhattan .
Our researcher predicted as an African minister who wants to convey suspected amounts to the United States to buy a house , yacht , a jet plane .
Now , what was really surprising was that all of these lawyers except one provided our investigations how to convey these sharp compounds .
These were first meetings , and none of these lawyers took us as a client and of course money didn &apos;t change hands , but it really showed the problem with the system .
It &apos;s also important not only to think of it as individual cases .
It &apos;s not just about certain lawyers talking to our investigators and providing suggestions .
It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician caught in the scandal .
It &apos;s about how the system works , which encourages corruption , avoiding tax , poverty and instability .
And to deal with that , we need to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make this kind of harder behavior .
But as a natural optimist , I do see that we start to change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards transparency when it comes to ownership of companies .
This issue was about the political agenda of the U.K. prime minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit that was conducted in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is going to create central regimes at the national level of who really owns and control companies across Europe .
One of the things that design is , in fact , the United States is framing behind .
There &apos;s a partisan legislation shown at the House and the Senate , but it &apos;s not as advanced as we would like to see .
So we really would like to see the Panama Delp , a huge increase in the money outside of the country , being used as a way to open in the United States and around the world .
For us in the Witness Bell , it &apos;s a moment of change .
We need ordinary people to get upset about how people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Such a secret is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and have to change the law to open this kind of secrecy .
Together , we can finally pay for secrecy that currently allows tax evaluation , corruption and building money to thrive .
Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
Recently reported that WikiLeaks , your developer , published — in the last few years more classified documents than all the rest of the world media combined .
Could it be ?
Julian Assange : Yes , could it be ?
It &apos;s worrying — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world media is failing so hard that a small group of activists can publish more of this kind of information than all other global press combined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people publish the documents ?
And how do you ensure their privacy ?
JA : These are — as far as we know — classical whistleblowers and we have some ways to get us through the data .
So we only use the most advanced encryption to communicate information across the network and hide traces , we train it in legal values like Sweden and Belgium to define legal protection .
We get information in the mail , a regular mail , encrypted or not , examining it like a regular news organization , making it — which is sometimes quite difficult to do , when we talk about huge databases of data — publishing it in the public and then protecting against the legal and political attacks that are inevitable .
CA : So you &apos;re trying to ensure that documents are talented , but in fact you almost never know the source identity .
JA : That &apos;s true , yeah . Just very rarely we &apos;ll ever know , and if we discover at some point , then we destroy this information as early as possible .
( Ringing ) Damn it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code for TEDsters is . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take the example , actually .
This is something you leaked a few years ago .
If we can get the document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
JA : So this is a Carol report .
It was a secret intelligence report invited by the government of Kenya after elected in 2004 .
Before 2004 , Kenya was dominated by Daniel Arap Moore for about 18 years .
He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
And when Kiki got control — using coalition of forces trying to clean Kenya from corruption — they invited this report , took about two million pounds out on it and on a lovely report .
And then the government discussed it and used it as a political landscape against Moore , which was the richest man — and yet we were the richest man — in Kenya .
This is the Holy Grail of the Kenyan press .
So I went there in 2007 , and we were able to put a hand on this right before the election — the national elections , on December 28 .
When we published the report , we did it three days after the new president , Kiki , decided to connect with the man he was going to go away , Daniel Arap Moi , so this report became a chocolate around President Kiki &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , very briefly — that the report has leaked into Kenya , not from official media , but not directly . And you think , it &apos;s changed the election results in fact .
JA : Yeah . He became the first title in the Guardian newspaper and then printed in all the neighboring countries in Kenya , in the press in Tanzania and South Africa .
And so it came from the outside .
And that , after a few days , made the Kenyan press feel confident about his uncertainty .
And it appeared 20 nights in a row on Kenyan TV , caused a 10 percent reduction in voting , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed election outcomes .
CA : Wow , so your leak fundamentally changed the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : There we are — we &apos;re going to show just a short clip of an airline attack in Baghdad .
The film itself is longer . But here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — strong material , I need to warn you .
Touch : ... Just damn , once you get on fire .
I see your factor , oh , I &apos;ve got about four cars four on four , ah , along ...
You have permission . All right . Live .
Tell me when you hit them . Let &apos;s shoot .
Get them all up .
Come on , fire !
( Shoot machine guns ) Keep shooting . Keep shooting . ( Shoot ) Keep shooting .
A hotel , a two-six boomer , a two-six boomer .
We need to move , now !
All right , we just caught all eight .
Yes , we see two birds , and we still shoot .
I got . I have them .
Two-six , two-six , we &apos;re in motion .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What happens ?
Damn it , Kate . All right , ha ha . I hit them .
CA : So , what was the impact of this ?
JA : The impact on the people who worked on this was hard .
We eventually sent two people to the clitoris to keep exploring this story .
So this is just the first of three attacks that happened in this scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in this attack , right , including two Ruters workers ?
JA : Yeah , two Ruters workers , two young children were injured .
18 to 26 people were killed in total .
CA : And the publication of this made many rise .
What was the key ingredient that actually caused uprising , do you think ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I guess people can see the inequalities of power .
You have people who walk calm down the street , and then a Apache helicopter sitting a mile away from a Afghan fire will stretch 30 millimeters on everybody — looking for every excuse to do this — and killing people trying to save performance .
And there are two journalists who are clearly not rebelled because it &apos;s their full-time job .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s this intelligence man from the United States , Bradley Manning , who &apos;s arrested . And the claim is that he confused Chat that he leaked the video to you , along with 280,000 bars classified from the US Embassy .
I mean , did he do that ?
JA : Well , we felt we got these lightning .
He was accused , five days ago , achieving 150,000 lightning and 50 advertising .
Now , we published earlier this year from Barack from the US Embassy in Rikeyk , but there &apos;s not necessarily a relationship between them .
I mean , I was a familiar critic in this embassy .
CA : I mean , if you got thousands of diplomatic lightning from the US Embassy ...
JA : We &apos;d advertise them . ( CA : Would you ? ) JA : Yes . ( CA : Because ? ) JH : Well , because that &apos;s the kind of thing that reveals what the real state of , say , Arab governments . The real impact on human rights in these governments is .
If you look at unclassified lightning , it &apos;s the kind of material you &apos;ll find there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little broader about this .
I mean , generally , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage a leap of secret information ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a question about what is the kind of information that matters to the world , what kind of information that can get reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So the data that organizations put economic effort in their hierarchy , it &apos;s a really good sign that when the data comes out , there &apos;s hope that it &apos;s useful in something , because the organizations that know it best , that know it from all sides , invest effort to hide it .
And this is what we actually found . And these are the press worms .
CA : But are there any risks in this , or the individuals where it &apos;s about or indeed the whole society where the leaf can have unintended consequences ?
JA : We haven &apos;t seen this from any thing we published .
I mean , we have damage immunity policy .
We have a way of engaging in information that is personal — personal information identifies in it .
But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your medical records , it &apos;s a legitimate secret , but we deal with whistleblowers that they volunteer and they really have a kind of good motivation .
CA : So they &apos;re good motivators .
And what would you say , for example , you know , somebody &apos;s parents — who built a servant in the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve uploaded something that someone would incentivize to come up .
It shows the United States soldier laughing at dead people .
It gives the impression — gave the impression to millions of people around the world that the U.S. soldiers are unhuman .
In fact , they &apos;re not . My son is not . How do you dare ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
JA : Yeah , we get a lot of responses like this .
But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t have to see the video , they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their minds . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It will change the perception and opinions of the people who pay for all of this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as a kind of dark secrets in companies and governments .
Light is good .
But don &apos;t you see irony in fact , that in order to light this light , you yourself , you need , to create secrets around your sources ?
JA : Not quite . I mean , we don &apos;t have DVicillins yet .
We don &apos;t have sources that have spread around other sources .
If they go out , it &apos;s going to be a complicated situation for us , but we probably work in a way that people feel moral obligation to continue our task , not to delay it .
CA : I &apos;d like to actually know , just on the basis of what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious about the opinion in the TED audience .
You know , there may be a few views about the Williams and Julian .
You know , hero — the hero of the people — brings this important light .
You make dangerous trouble .
Who has the hero character ?
Who has the character making trouble ?
JA : Oh , really . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a soft audience , Julian , a soft audience .
We have to embrace more , let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t leaked yet , but I think you &apos;ll do it for TED .
I mean , it &apos;s a fascinating story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
What is it ?
JA : So this is a sample of things that we do about every day .
So last year — in November last year — there was a series of wells in Albania like the Bahar explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we got a report — a kind of engineering analysis of what happened — which is , in fact , preserving , from some competitor , these are oil companies competing , we actually smuggled trucks and exploded them .
And there was a mixture of some of the Albania government within that , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing on it , so for us it &apos;s a very difficult document .
We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who was writing it and who knew what it was about .
So we were skeptical that maybe it &apos;s a competitive oil company just trying to use it .
So in these circumstances , we took it out and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , feels right , but we can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , who wants to go on the tracks of the source — ( Laughter ) And she says , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to know who the source is . &quot; &quot; So we told them , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What kind of document are you talking about ?
Can you show that you have legal authority about this document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us a screen shot with the name attached to the identical details of Microsoft Word .
Yeah .
( Applause ) But it happened quite a few times .
This is one of our methods of identifying — to quantify matter , to make these guys write letters .
CA : Yeah . Did you have internal information from BP ?
JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , right now , we &apos;re busy raising serious contributions and engineering effort .
So our rate of publishing in the last few months has become minimum as we reengineer our systems for the extraordinary public interest that we have .
It &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any start-up organization that grows , we &apos;re pretty stunned by our growth , and that means that we &apos;re getting huge amounts of discoveries from very high levels of corruption , but we don &apos;t have enough people to actually process all this information .
CA : So this is the central bottleneck , mostly volunteer journalists and / or journalists &apos; funding for journalists ?
JA : Yeah , right , and people you can trust .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization for which it &apos;s hard to grow fast because of the kind of material that we &apos;re dealing with , so we need to rebuild to have people to deal with a high-security material , and then also open security cases .
CA : So help us understand personally about you and how you got to engage with it .
And I think I read that the child went to 37 different schools .
Could that be true ?
JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then they were in a dead flight , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say it &apos;s a recipe for making paranoia .
JA : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you also — I mean , you were the hacker from a young age and you collided with authorities early on .
JA : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young activist journalist at an early age .
I wrote a journal , I was placed to Dan in Galileo when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with the hacker .
I mean , there &apos;s a kind of — there &apos;s a method that can be applied to all sorts of things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s mostly operated by the Russian bakery to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
So this expression is not — it &apos;s not as nice as it was before .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing someone &apos;s bank account , but what about your central values ?
Can you give us a sense of them and maybe an event in your life that helped you set them up ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure about an event .
But the key values : Well , generous people , capable people don &apos;t form victims , they nurture victims .
And this is something from my father and something from generous people and other capabilities that touched my life .
CA : generous people don &apos;t create victims , they nurture victims ?
JA : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a fighter person , so the whole thing of cultivating isn &apos;t really powerful for me , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to nurture victims , which is to monitor crime performers .
And so this is something that has been in my character for a long time .
So tell us very quickly in the last minute , the story : What happened in Iceland ?
You actually published something there , you were crying with a bank , and then the news service there got a prevention that was banned for the publication of the story .
Instead , they published your side .
It made you very familiar in Iceland . What happened next ?
JA : Yeah , that was a huge case , you know .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
It has been touched most in every country in the world .
Her banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we released this report in July last year .
And the national television got a five-minute advertising prohibition before it got into the air , like out of a movie , a bullet of advertising landed on the news table , and the interviewer was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well we just showed the site in place , all the time , to fill it up , and we became very famous in Iceland , we went to Iceland and and we talked about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that this shouldn &apos;t happen again to the world , and as a result , using some Icelandic politicists and other international court experts , we created a new kind of legislation package for Iceland to make it an input for free press , the world &apos;s most powerful journalist defenses , with a new Nobel laureate for speech freedom .
Iceland is a northern country , so , like Norway , it can connect to the system .
And just a month ago , it was passed in the Icelandic parliament here .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
When you think about the future then , do you think it &apos;s likely to be the Big Brother running much more controls , more secrets , or do we talk about the Big Brother , or is the game open to any direction ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure which direction it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there are huge pressures to create harmony in the legislation about the freedom of speech and legislation about transparency around the world — within the European market , between China and the United States .
Which way would it go ? It &apos;s hard to predict .
So it &apos;s an interesting time to be in , because with a small effort we might tilt it in one direction or the other .
CA : Well , I seem to reflect the audience &apos;s opinion of humor , Julian , careful and straight .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel lucky to come from a country that is usually considered , to the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland who died .
And they didn &apos;t go to work that day whether there were career women or there were homework jobs .
They marched to the center of Rickwick — 90 percent of the women participated — and peacefully and solidarity demanded equality .
Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when there are no women at work .
( Applause ) Five years later , Icelandians had the courage to be the first country in the world elected democratically , a woman for president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , that President Viggs , as we know her on the private platform , went out to the terrace in her house , if a unit , with her daughter next to her when she won .
( Applause ) This woman was an amazing role model for me and for everyone who grew up at that time , including boys .
She never told her , how did a little boy turn to her after she served a number of fairness in the job and said , &quot; &quot; Can boys be president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A role model is important , but also when there is such a strong role model that I thank for his existence , when I was encouraged to run for president , my first reaction was , &quot; Who am I going to run for president ? &quot;
Who am I going to be president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out women are less likely to be able to run for men &apos;s presidents .
A study done in the United States in 2011 shows that 62 percent of men thought to apply positions to role and only 45 percent of women .
This is a 16 percent gap , and this is the same gap that existed in the previous decade as well .
And it &apos;s really bad , because I &apos;m convinced that the world really needs women leadership and leadership based more on principles generally .
So my decision to run ended up being part of the fact that I felt that I had to do my part , even if I had no political experience , stabilize and try to be part of creating a world that would make sense and sustainable for our children , a world where we really allow our sons to be whatever they want .
And it was my life &apos;s journey .
And it was amazing .
The journey started with 20 potential candidates .
Taking down to nine candidates , and finally declining four runners . Three men and I .
( Applause ) But this is not where the drama ends .
You think you have a drama in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can assure you , ours was our own drama in Iceland .
So , our president who had been spending 20 years announcing at the beginning that he wasn &apos;t going to run what probably led to so many people who were considering running .
And then he changed his mind when our Prime Minister passed away after the Panama Panama Panama Prize known for a stroke who cried him and his family .
And there was a peer-to-peer protest in Iceland , so the president thought that the people needed a reliable leader .
After a few days , his wife &apos;s connections and his family owners were also discovered in Panama &apos;s orbits , and he removed his orbit from the race .
Before he retired , he said he did it because now there are two candidates that he felt could fill his place in a role .
So on May 9 , 45 days before the election day , things didn &apos;t seem very careful to me .
I didn &apos;t even go into the graphs in the newspaper .
The polls placed me on one percent , and it was still the tallest of any woman who had access to candidates .
So it would be a little bit to say , that I had to work really hard to get to sit at the table of the big ones , and access to television , because the TV network decided that only two and a half percent candidates and upstairs would participate in the first TV set .
I found out in the first TV confrontation meadow that I also share with three other men , and I found a direct broadcast that I had reached exactly 2.5 percent in the first conflict day .
( Applause ) So , challenges .
The challenges that I first faced in this journey were with communication , power and money .
Let &apos;s start with communication .
Some say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to communication and politics .
I can &apos;t say I agree .
To get air time in the media was harder for me .
In fact , the lead candidate appeared in the 87 series of times in the months before the election , while I was performing 31 times .
And I &apos;m not saying that the media is doing it consciously .
I think it &apos;s mostly unconscious bias , because in communications , just like anywhere else , we have conscious and unconscious bias , and we have to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it .
When I finally got access to television , the first question I asked was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to retire ? &quot; &quot; And it was a tough question .
But of course , with one to 2.5 percent in surveys , maybe it &apos;s understandable .
I was the only one of four candidates who didn &apos;t get an interview on the main page of the newspaper .
I was often left out of questions asking the rest of the candidates and outside the case of the election .
So I dealt with this , but I say this , as an organization for the Icelandic media .
I got a little bit if any comments on my hair and my pants &apos; suit .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So they &apos;re so honored .
But there &apos;s another experience , which is very important .
I ran as an independent position , without a political party or another force supporting me .
This lack of experience and the lack of access to resources probably hit our campaign capabilities , but it also allowed us to innovate and create a different politics .
We ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the rule of choices to the rest of the candidates as a result of that .
It might be why I won at least a screen time , because I wanted to show respect to the rest of the candidates .
When the approach to communication has been so hard , we ran our media .
I did live on Facebook where I answered instead of the question of the voters on any subject .
We published all the questions I asked and answers I answered on Facebook because we believe transparency is a very important thing if you want to create trust .
And when you want to get to young voters , it &apos;s challenging , I started using SantapCat .
I asked young folks to teach me how to use it , and I used all the filters that exist during the last period of the campaign .
And I had to use a lot of humor and humility , because I was really bad at it .
But we &apos;ve increased the amount of followers among the young people .
So you can run campaigns differently .
But unfortunately , you can &apos;t talk about politics without mentioning money .
And I think that &apos;s the way , but that &apos;s the truth , we had less financial resources than the rest of the candidates .
Some of this comes from the fact that I had a hard time asking for financial support .
And maybe I had the desire to do more with less .
Some would say it &apos;s very feminine on my side .
But even with a third exposure to communication and a third of financial resources , and only an entrepreneurial team , but an amazing team , we were able to surprise everyone in the evening of elections , when the first numbers started coming .
I surprised myself , as you can see in this picture .
( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I was head head with the leading candidate .
( Applause ) Too early , because I couldn &apos;t keep it , but I got to another place , and we did a long way from one percent , with close to one third of the voices , and we won the polls with an unprecedented profit , with more than 10 percent of what the last survey was watching .
Some say that &apos;s why I &apos;m the real conductor of the elections , and there are many who encouraged me to run again .
But what really fills me with pride is to know that I was privileged with a higher percentage of the young voices , and a lot of people who encourage my daughter to run in 2040 .
( Applause ) She &apos;s 13 years old and never appeared on television before .
And on election day , I watched her again and again on the screen , and she was smart , and she was confident , she was honest , and she supported her mother .
This was probably the peak point of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
These are girls of a duty garden on a trip , who found my poster in a bus stop , and found a right to kiss it .
Audience : Ooh .
This picture is a satisfying victory for me .
What we see , we can be .
So the heck with fears and challenges .
( Applause ) It &apos;s important that women are dealing with , and it &apos;s time for more women to deal with key positions , whether it &apos;s for a CEO &apos;s job , or whether it &apos;s for president .
I even managed to impress your New Yorker newspaper to get a new degree &quot; &quot; live ammoji of honesty . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) It may be the most respected mail I &apos;ve ever received , and the reason is that women often get punished when they use what I call emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become good when we do exactly that .
( Applause ) And we need more of it .
We celebrated as if we won the evening of elections , because that &apos;s exactly how we felt .
So you don &apos;t really have to get the job .
You just have to run to it , and you , your family , your friends , and anyone who works with you , if you do it well , develop beyond anything you &apos;ve ever experienced before .
So we enjoyed , and I learned a lot on the journey , probably more lessons than those I shared here while we had today .
But be sure , it was hard work .
I lost many hours a year in those months .
It requires mental resilience and persistence not to retire , but I learned something , which I knew before that day of the 1 percent , and that is that we can only be good when we really are authentic and attentive to ourselves and work at the core with this .
As my good sister often says , you can trust your intuition , but your intuition will never bother you .
I also think it &apos;s very important , and you all know this , that every journey you &apos;re going to go is the team you &apos;re taking with you .
It &apos;s that there are people around you who share your values and your vision , but different in all the other planes .
This is the formula for success for me , and I blessed with an amazing husband , who &apos;s here with me today , in a terrifying family — ( Applause ) And with wonderful friends and we put together as entrepreneurs in the political country , and we took something that everybody said was impossible .
In fact , the leading marketing man told me before I made a decision that if I got seven percent , it would be great .
I edited his angle of view , because he was probably right , and he said it based on years of experience .
But on day one , I decided to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s important to mention this , because I lost many hours of sleep and worked hard , and so did the people I had with .
We can never walk to the end if we forget to worry about ourselves .
And two things that I think are very important in this context , surrounding yourself with people and practices that feed you , and at the same time and perhaps more importantly , being brave to get rid of people and practices that suck from you energies , including the wonderful , responsive bloggers .
I had a lot of support from others when I was implementing it , and I made a decision to keep pushing when others had dropped their pace , and it allowed me to partly keep energies during the entire journey .
And when I lost energy for a moment — and every time it happened , it wasn &apos;t simple — I always went back to the reason why I decided to run , and my choice to run through my own way .
I called it the 4G campaign , the G symbolizes the words in Icelandic .
And the first one is called &quot; &quot; Gagn . &quot; &quot; I wanted to do good , stand up to your service , and make a job leader to be at the center of my doing and everyone in the campaign .
The second word is Gleveli or happiness .
I decided to enjoy the way .
There were many insights to take from the journey , no matter whether the distance was achieved or not .
And I tried as a best to inspire others to do that too .
The third is &quot; &quot; Gagnesi . &quot; &quot; ( Transparency ) I was open to any question .
I didn &apos;t keep secrets , and everything was exposed on Facebook and websites .
Because I think if you choose your president , you have the right to get answers .
And last but not least , I don &apos;t have to explain that in this room we ran on the principle of female power .
( Applause ) I &apos;m really happy that I &apos;ve had the courage to run , to risk loss , but to be successful in so many dimensions .
I can &apos;t say it was easy but I can say , and I think all of my team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not releasing you yet . These are Tomorrow : What a great audience PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying .
Which is probably everybody in the room ready to go to Iceland and and point to you .
But we probably don &apos;t want to vote there , but one thing we can take from Iceland and and that we &apos;ve always been inspired .
I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 1975 when all the Icelandic women walked outside , and it was a significant point in liberating women &apos;s movement .
You treated it earlier . I was glad to reconceive the picture and just remind us that it was like a whole country was arresting a kingdom .
And what you may not know is that American media didn &apos;t report that , that the Icelandic women marched again on Monday , right ?
HT : Right . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
HT : Yeah , so 41 years after its original home , we &apos;re probably the best place to be a woman , but our work hasn &apos;t finished yet .
So on Monday at 14 : 38 , women in Iceland left the job , because then they got their daily wage .
( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men have participated in higher numbers than before , because it &apos;s time to close the salary gap .
PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask these guys to commit now why she &apos;s going to do next , but it means that you have a big volunteer army would be and decide to run again .
Thank you .
HT : Thank you all .
( Applause )
Why should I pay them equal pay for the same job ?
The second major epidemic that causes this problem is the segregation of violence , which is increasingly increasing in the whole world .
When I was a leader of Georgia , one in 1,000 Americans was in jail .
Today , 7.3 people from every 1,000 are in prison .
If you do the math , California costs 307 million dollars to send one person to the red .
One is sex corruption .
It &apos;s a horrible suffering of all the women who live in these countries .
And this was done by her family members , so they become murderers when the girl Mita Kleon on the family .
In Atlanta , the world &apos;s deepest airport , and it &apos;s massively transported from the southern hemisphere .
A white leather girl will put in a few times more , and on the average bubble in Atlanta , and now in the United States , can earn about 35,000 dollars a day .
The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia is bigger than all the drug trade .
And this leads to one of the most severe problems , which is that we are buying more and more women who are entering sex slavery in all countries of the world .
About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and no longer prosecutors in which women use less sex , but the brothel owners , the pessians and the male clients , and — ( Applause ) Teleminated prostitution .
In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
For every male who was arrested in a criminal sex garden , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
Canada , Ireland , Sweden I &apos;ve already mentioned , France and other countries are now moving to the Swedish model .
We have two big institutions in our country that are all about us : our military and our great university system .
We &apos;re now looking at the military how many sexual assaults are happening .
In the last report I got , 26,000 sexual assaults happened in the military — 26,000 .
You have to change the law .
They &apos;re not prosecuted to trial .
These are the things that happen in our society .
So we &apos;ve done a particular breakthrough , partly , because I &apos;ve been the president and so forth — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years there has not been any progress , and the difference has remained 23-24 percent over the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what happens .
This is what happens in our country .
Another problem with the United States is being the most pressing nation on the planet .
We &apos;ve been involved in wars with 25 separate countries since World War II .
We had ruins fighting on the ground .
Or collapsed forces that have dropped bombs on people .
We &apos;ve fought against 25 different countries or more , since World War II .
There &apos;s another fundamental factor that I don &apos;t have to mention , which is that generally , men don &apos;t put a cut .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
So what is the fundamental thing we need to do today ?
I didn &apos;t even get into details about this .
&quot; What am I going to be ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to dance to the sound of your war .
I &apos;m not going to give my breath and not my bones to the drum of your war .
I &apos;m not going to dance for this drum sound .
I know the rhythm .
It &apos;s life-free .
I personally know the skin you cry .
He used to live once , hunt , steal , stretch .
I &apos;m not going to dance for your twisted war .
I &apos;m not going to jump , turn around , or break for you .
I won &apos;t hate you or even hate you .
I &apos;m not going to kill you .
And you certainly don &apos;t die for you .
I won &apos;t cry the dead in murder or suicide .
I won &apos;t encode you or dance for bombs because everyone dancing .
Everybody can get it wrong .
Life is a right , not mutual or accidental .
I won &apos;t forget where I came from .
I &apos;ll stop my drum .
I &apos;ll pick up my relatives , and our reserve will be dance .
Our hum will be our drum .
You won &apos;t play me .
I &apos;m not going to give my name or my rhythm to your rhythm .
I &apos;m going to dance and challenge and dance and dance and dance .
These pinks are stronger than they are .
Your drum of war is no longer powerful than this breath . Ah .
What does TEDsters sound like ? Let me hear you do some noise .
( Applause ) A bunch of socialists .
Incredible , striving to be a pessimist .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot last time .
Very , very much .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
I mean , I said I was preparing .
What that means is I made my clothes . ( Laughter ) I made options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming and walking before .
Poetry does that .
It makes you ready . It directs you .
So I &apos;m going to read a song that &apos;s being picked right now .
But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit down to 10 minutes and hold a woman who &apos;s not here now .
Hold it up now with you .
You don &apos;t have to say her name , you can just hold her .
Do you hold it ?
It &apos;s &quot; &quot; broken broken . &quot; &quot; The whole sacred history has been banned .
Books that didn &apos;t write predict the future , predicted the past .
But my head opens around what seems limitless , the violent creative of the human .
Who would that be ?
What male son will kill a new day ?
The death of our boys landed .
We sacrifice carcasses .
We overlook women , complicated .
The dogs cry every day .
The prophets are being done , ignored by prophets .
Girls of war and trust are saltwater .
All colors run , none of us are solid .
Don &apos;t look for a shadow behind me . I carry it inside .
I live in cycles of light and darkness .
The pace is half inanimate .
I see now , I &apos;ve never been one or the other .
Patients , health , soft violence .
I think now that I &apos;ve never been pure .
Before I was a storm , blind , shaking — I still am .
The person shared blindness , glue .
I &apos;ve never been pure .
A girl who was corrupt before she got diarrhea .
Language can &apos;t understand me .
I &apos;m an exponential farm .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 of her family members .
Another woman might have six .
One woman loses her head .
Another woman is looking for the rubble . One woman eats garbage .
One woman shot in front of her . One woman shot her husband .
One woman is calling herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman no longer believes that love will find her .
One woman never believed .
Where did the refugee hearts go ?
Cricles , humiliated , are where they don &apos;t belong , don &apos;t want them to miss them .
We face deprivation .
We sacrifice anyone or we don &apos;t mean at all .
My spine is covered with a spiral .
Serious wanted from people and to them .
Cool bombs were left behind .
It &apos;s actually landmines .
Sorry rises fire .
You harvest a infected tobacco .
Sorry bombs .
Sorry baby teeth .
Simple curves , smoke .
Sorry steps , smoke .
Choice , smoke .
Joshua , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
It was registered .
Don &apos;t worry about what exploded .
If you have to , fear what didn &apos;t blow up .
Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was a student here at Oxford in the &apos; 70s , the future of the world was busy .
The church explosion was unstoppable .
Global hunger was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
The brown rain fell on the forests .
The desert went on one or two miles every year .
The oil was going to run out and a nuclear winter was supposed to eliminate all of us .
None of these things happened . ( Laughter ) And in an amazing way , if you look at what did happen in my lifetime , the average income for the average person of the world , in real terms , adjusted to inflation , tripled .
Life expectancy grew by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality has gone down by two thirds .
The per capita food productivity grows by a third .
And all of that while the population has doubled .
How did we get that — whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not .
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that thrives as much as its population grows ?
The size of this graph is the size of the population , and the size of the graph describes GDP per capita .
I think in order to answer this question , you have to understand how humans share their mind and allow ideas to fit together and recombine and meet and indeed , mate .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas do sex .
I want you to imagine how we came from making objects like this to making objects like this .
These are both real objects .
One is a two-and-a-half million years ago of the kind done by Homo erectus .
The other one is clearly a computer mouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and the form amazingly .
I tried to figure out which ones are bigger and it &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit in a human hand .
They &apos;re both kind of technology . In the end , the imagination between them is not that interesting .
It just tells us that both of them were designed to fit in a human hand .
The differences are what I &apos;m interested in , because the left creates about the same permanent piece for almost a million years — from about a million and a half years ago to half a million years ago .
Homo erectus did the same tool for 30,000 generations .
Of course there were some changes , but tools slowly changed more skeletons in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s the truth .
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
And there &apos;s another difference , which is that the object on the left is made of one material .
The object on the right is made up of a mix of materials , silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a mixture of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of laser , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;ve all been combining this technology together .
And this is this combination , this collaborative technology that I &apos;m interested in , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understand what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body is also a bunch of ideas , the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
They integrated .
How does evolution do collaborative things , accumulate ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
In sexual species , if you get two different mutations in creatures , one green and one red , then one has to be better than the other .
One is extinct and the other survives .
But if you have a species species , then it &apos;s possible to unite the two different mutations online .
So what Sex does is it allows the individual to get the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not limited to its ancestry .
So what is the process that has the same effect in cultural development as sex has on biological development ?
And I believe the answer is exchange , the leg of replacing one thing in another .
This is a unique human feature .
No other animal does that .
You can teach them in the lab to do a little bit of exchange , and indeed there &apos;s a interaction between other animals , but the replacement of one object in another never happens .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No one has ever seen a dog do a fair replacement of another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s possible to have a culture without exchange .
You can have , a sexual culture .
Chimpanzees , pack whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
They teach each other traditions that are transmitted by a parent &apos;s inheritance to the offspring .
In this case , chimpanzees teach each other how to crack nuts with stones .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , don &apos;t grow , never gather , don &apos;t become cooperative , and the reason is there &apos;s no &quot; &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no exchange of ideas .
Chimpanzees have a different culture in different band .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange increase the standard of life ?
Well , the answer comes from David Ricardo in 1817 .
And here &apos;s the Stone Age version of his story , although he told him in the sense of trade between states .
The person takes four hours to make a skirt and three hours to make a nucleus .
A goat needs one hour to make a parking and two to make a garden .
So a better concentration than both people in parties and in Germans .
He doesn &apos;t need a person .
He can do his Germans and his shops .
Well no , because if you think about it , if a goat makes two spears and a person makes two axes , and they make a exchange trade , then each of them will save an hour of work .
And whilst they do it more , it will become more true , because the more they do it , the better a person is going to get better at doing grains , and a goat will become better at making spears .
So commercial profits are just going to make a statement .
And this is one of the beautiful things about commerce , it creates the momentum for specialization , which in turn creates the momentum for more trade and so on .
A man and a goat were both saving an hour of time .
This is prosperity , the savings while you need to satisfy your needs .
Ask yourself how long you had to work to give yourself an hour of reading light tonight to read a book .
If you had to start from scratch , say go to the village .
You find sheep , you kill it , you find the fat out of it .
You process it , you make a candle and so on .
How long is it going to take you ? Not a little time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you earn the average wage in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
There in 1950 , you had to work eight seconds in the average wage to get the same amount of light .
And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity you &apos;ve achieved since 1950 , because it &apos;s seven and a half seconds you could do something else with it , or you could buy a goods or other service .
And somewhere in 1880 , it was 15 minutes required to earn the same amount of light from the average wage .
In 1800 , you had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
In other words , the average person in the average salary couldn &apos;t afford a candle in 1800 .
Let &apos;s go back to this picture of the Garden and the mouse , and ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who did it for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was done by someone for him .
He was independent .
We call it poverty these days .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Dozens ? Hundreds ? thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
Because you have to include the man who raised the coffee , cooked for the man on the oil bank , who was a gun for oil , who was going to be a plastic processor and so on .
They all worked for me , making a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how society works .
This is what we obtained as a species .
Once , if you were rich , you had people who worked for you substantially .
That &apos;s how you turned rich , you copied them .
The 14th director had a lot of people working for him .
They did his silly costumes for him , like this . ( Laughter ) And they did his silly crashes or whatever .
He had 498 people who had prepared his dinner every night .
But a modern tourist walking around Harmon and Rasai looking at the pictures of the 14th century , he also has 498 people preparing for him dinner .
They &apos;re in Beestro , cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour with a great meal that &apos;s better quality , probably , of those who are 14 eats .
And that &apos;s what we did , because we all work for each other .
We &apos;re able to revise specialization and trade to increase the standard of life of each other .
Now , there are animals that work for each other .
Ants are a classic example , working for queens and working queens for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
There &apos;s not one work for the other between colonies .
And the reason for that is that there &apos;s a labor distribution by reproduction .
I mean , they specialize on the breeding .
The queen does everything .
In our species , we don &apos;t like to do that .
It &apos;s the only thing we insist on doing ourselves , reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the queen .
( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
And how long does it last ? And what does it mean ?
Well , I think , probably the oldest version of this is probably the sexual distribution of work .
But I don &apos;t have any evidence for that .
It just seemed like the first thing we did was to employ the woman for the man and the man for the woman .
In all hunting companies — foraging today has a job of searching for food between , largely , male hunters for foragers .
It &apos;s not always that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between dedicated roles between men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s integrating with each side .
The woman knows that in the case of the jellyfish here — that you can dig roots and share with the men in return to the flesh — she knows that all she has to do to get access to the protein is to dig a few other roots and replace them with flesh .
And she doesn &apos;t have to go hunting exhausting and try to kill a pig of yields .
And the man knows you don &apos;t have to dig to get roots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a pig , he &apos;s big enough to share a little bit .
And so both sides bring up one standard of life through the sexual distribution of work .
When did that happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do it .
They were a very collaborative species .
They were a very smart species .
Their brain , on average , towards the end , was bigger than mine and yours in this room today .
They were creative . They buried the dead they were .
They had a language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene from the same kind of thing that we had discovered here in Oxford .
And it seemed like they had language skills .
They were brilliant people , I don &apos;t invite Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence that they had sexual distribution of work .
There &apos;s no evidence of women &apos;s infinite behavior .
It looks like the women were collaborative hunters with the men .
And the other thing that there &apos;s no evidence for is a exchange between groups , because the objects that find in Neanderthal skeletons , the tools they &apos;ve done , are always made out of local materials .
For example , in Couaz there &apos;s a website that you can find local Neanderthals .
They &apos;re always made of local weak stone .
In the same valley , there are modern human remains from the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of them are local weak stone , but beyond that , many of them are made of stone and bought from a very far away place .
And when humans started moving objects like this , it was evidence that they were doing a cross-section of groups .
Trade is 10 times older than agriculture .
People forget this . People think trade is a modern thing .
A substitute between groups has been happening over a hundred thousand years .
And the earliest evidence for this was emerging about 80 to 120,000 years ago in Africa , so you can see volcanic glass and language and other things go long distances in Ethiopia .
You can also see shells — as it was discovered here by a team from Oxford — moving 125 miles into the continent from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
And this is a view that people started to exchange groups .
And that led to specialization .
How do you know that movement to a large distance indicates trade rather than immigration ?
Well , you &apos;re looking at modern collectors like Aboriginal , which were designed for stone axes in a place called Mount Ice , which was used as a quarry that owned a Calcadon tribe .
They trafficked them with their neighbors for things like mantas battles , and the result was that stone axes came to large parts of Australia .
So a long-distance movement of tools is a sign of commerce , not for immigration .
What happens when you cut people out of trade , from the ability to replace and specialize ?
And the answer is that not only do you slow down the technological advance , you can turn it back .
An example of this is Tasmania .
When the sea level went up and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it , not only had a slower progression than the people on the continent , they actually tried to drive .
They would give up the ability to make tools and fishing equipment and clothing because a population of 4,000 people just wasn &apos;t big enough to preserve the expertise skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
It &apos;s like the people in this room would be sent to the desert island .
How many of the things in our pockets could we keep making after 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen at Tayla Fugo — a similar island , similar people .
The reason is because Tyre Foughue is separated from South America in a much narrower product , and there &apos;s been trading ratio along this product for 10,000 years .
The markers were isolated .
Go back to this picture again and ask yourself , not just who did it and who ? But who knew how to do it ?
In the case of the stone axe , the person who created it knew how to do it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
No one . Indeed , no one .
There &apos;s no one on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean that quite seriously .
The president of the computer mice doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to manage society .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill oil into producing plastic and so on .
We all know small parts , but none of us know the whole .
I &apos;m a quote from a famous article by Leonard Reed , an economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pron , &quot; &quot; where he wrote about how a pencil emerges , and how no one knows how to make a pencil , because the people who make it don &apos;t know how to sell graffiti , and they don &apos;t know how to process trees and that kind of thing .
And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through trade and specialization , is that we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
In language , we can only communicate ideas that we understand each other .
But with technology , we actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
We &apos;ve moved beyond the ability of the human brain to extraordinary learning .
And by the way , this is one of the reasons why I &apos;m not interested in discussing IQ , and whether certain groups have an IQ higher than others .
It &apos;s absolutely not belonging .
What does matter to society is how well people communicate their ideas , and how good they are in collaboration , not how sophisticated they are .
So we created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just nodes online .
We are the neurons in this brain .
This is the exchange of ideas , the meeting and the classification of ideas between them , that causes the advance of technology , in growth , more and more .
However , bad things happen .
And in the future , as we go forward , we , of course , will try terrible things .
There will be wars , there will be financial crises . There will be natural disasters .
Nothing terrible will happen this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure , because of the connections that people create , and the ability of ideas to meet and mate as never happened , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore the standard of life will rise .
Because through the cloud , through shared resources through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not only the elite , but everyone can hold their ideas and make them meet and mate , we certainly accelerate the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

Good afternoon .
My name is Oldus .
I &apos;m a photograph artist from Russia .
I started my way six years ago with Iranian independent portraits that showed so many stereotypes about nationals , gender , social issues — &#91; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m Russia , I &apos;m a drug salesman , weapons , porn and children ! &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Vodka — water . I love Vodka ! &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) — using photographs as a tool to send messages . &#91; &quot; I &apos;m getting married and I &apos;m still trying to get out of the camera .
I &apos;m focusing on balance meaningful messages , aesthetics , beauty , composition , some irony , and objects .
Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , called desperate romance .
They are my objects , or paintings from the Permian Percent Age in England in the mid-19th century .
I took the painting and I gave a new meaning , a contemporary that talks about the issues that surround me in Russia , capturing people that are not models but have an interesting story .
This kid is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at the bottom , he hides his dance classes and takes a mask of violence , tries to combine with the rest of the classrooms like a soldier has no personality .
But this kid has goals and dreams but he hides them to be socially acceptable , because being different is not easy , especially in Russia .
The next detail interpretation is metaphorical .
And this is Nikola , a security guard in one of the guys at St. Petersburg .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; when he grabs the fuel from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
He hides his sensitivity and his romantic side because in Russia , among men , it &apos;s not a voice to be romantic , but it &apos;s a voice to be surrounded by women and to look like aggressive gas .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I take a painting and give it a new and new meaning .
Sometimes , I &apos;ll compare facial features and play with words : irony , the iron man , the accelerator man .
( Laughter ) Through objects , I bring social issues that surround me in Russia into the bush .
Interesting facts about marriage in Russia , that most 18,19 girls are already ready and dreaming to marry .
We learn from girls , successful marriages means successful life , so most girls kind of fight to find a good husband .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
For the Russian company , I &apos;m an old , hopeless veteran to ever marry .
So you see me with a Mexican war mask , in a college dress , all desperately in my garden .
But remember , irony is the key , and it &apos;s actually to encourage girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change the stereotypes .
Be brave , be ironic — it helps .
They were funny and they created magic .

My name is a colleague .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I came up with this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss that is actually here , and it allowed me to do it .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
There are many stories about why we did it .
I think my personal story is simply explained in this slide , and it &apos;s an attitude .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education — I don &apos;t complain — but I didn &apos;t have access to many of these museums and these artworks .
So when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
And while working at Google , I &apos;m trying to use this passion and make it more accessible together with technology .
So we set up a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you some of the interesting things that we &apos;ve had since the launch .
So , quite simply : you can go on GoogleArtables Project.com.
You &apos;re looking at all these museums here .
You have the physical , you have the hum . The Heritage , the Reicks , Hyan Gogh .
I &apos;m going to actually show one of my favorites , the Metropolitan in New York .
There are two ways to go in — very simple .
Trickshaking and bang , you &apos;re in the museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it really doesn &apos;t matter .
You &apos;re wandering through space , you &apos;re having fun .
Do you want to navigate the museum ?
Open the map , and in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the hallway .
Keep going . Enjoy .
Research .
( Applause ) Thank you . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m standing in front of one of my favorite paintings , Peter Brugal Brugal Butt &apos;s curators .
I see this cup mark .
If the museum gave us the picture , you press it .
Now this is one of the images .
So that &apos;s all the other data .
For those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on it — but I &apos;m going to close it now .
And this is one of the images that we &apos;ve taken in what we call the Gagpixel technology .
So this picture , for example , has soon , I think , about 10 billion pixels .
And I often get asked , &quot; What do you get in 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try to show what you really get in 10 billion pixels .
You can just zoom in .
You see fun things happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is precious .
But then you really want to go deep .
So I started playing with it , and I found something happening here .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; Wait a minute , it sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I walked in , and I started to realize that actually these kids are supporting something .
I did some research , I talked to some of my contexts at Matt , and I found that in fact it &apos;s a game called Sound , where foie gras on Thursday before the prize moves the Easter .
And it turns out he was very popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep into this , you can actually get to the arrows .
And just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out , so that you really see what you get .
Here we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best will come right away — so in a second .
So now let &apos;s quickly jump to a death , again in New York .
So here &apos;s another one of my favorites , the Star Wars . Now the example I showed you was about finding detail .
But what if you want to see blue metals ?
And what if you want to see how John Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
You zoom in . You really get in .
I &apos;m going to go into one of my favorite areas in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get into the cracks .
It &apos;s a star cylinder , I think , never looked like this before .
I &apos;ll show you my second favorite feature .
There are many other things here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the really cool part . It &apos;s called collections .
Each of you , every one — no matter whether you &apos;re rich , or poor , if you have a fancy house — no matter .
You can go in and create a private museum online — create a private collection of all these images .
Basically , you go in — and I created this called the glow force — you can just zoom in to the images .
This is the ambassador , which is in the National Gallery .
You can put comments into images , and send friends and really start a conversation about what you feel when you go through these masterpieces .
So I think , to conclude , for me , the main thing that all these amazing things don &apos;t really come from Google .
They don &apos;t , I think , come even from the museums .
I probably don &apos;t have to say that .
It really comes from artists .
And it was an experience that filled me with humility here .
I mean , I hope that in the digital medium we will be justice for their creations and display them online .
And the biggest question I &apos;m going to ask these days is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the walking experience to the museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to add to the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I tell stories .
This is what I do in my life — storyteller , Roman writer , and today I &apos;d like to tell you some stories about the art of storytelling and also about a legendary creature called Jenny .
But before I get there , please let me share with you a little bit of a story of my life .
I &apos;m going to do that with the help of words , of course , but also with the help of an engineering , the circle , and so , during my talk , you &apos;re going to encounter some circles .
I was born in Strasburg , France for Turkey parents .
Shortly after that , my parents separated , and I moved to the church with my mother .
In the next few years , I grew up as a single child for a single mother .
In the early &apos; 70s , in Ankra , it was a slightly unusual play .
Our neighborhood was full of big family , where fathers were the head of the family , and so I grew up in my mother as a groove in a patriarchal environment .
In fact , in my adolescence , I looked at two types of female .
On the one hand was my mother , a surgical woman who is educated , secular , modern and Western .
And on the other hand , my grandmother , who took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and certainly less rational .
It was a woman , who read in the background at the bottom of the coffee cup to see the future and taxes lead to mystical forms to defend against the bad eye .
Many people have visited my grandmother , people with strict accidents of ecstasy on their faces or nights in their hands .
Every time , my grandmother would take a few words in Arabic , take a red apple and review it in pink lines as the number of nights she wanted to remove .
And then — one by one , she would surround these lines with black ink .
A week later , the patient would go back to a surveillance test .
So , I &apos;m aware that it &apos;s worth not saying things like this to a crowd of scholars and scientists , and the truth is , among all these people who have visited my grandmother because of their skin situation , I &apos;ve never seen anybody who has come out of it unsatisfied or uncured .
I asked her how to do it . Was it the prayer force ?
In response , &quot; &quot; Yes , prayer is effective , but also , the preservation of the power in circles . &quot; &quot; Which I learned , among other things , one very important lesson : that if you want to destroy something in life , whether it &apos;s a wrist , or a flaw or a person &apos;s mind , all you have to do is attack a thick wall .
What &apos;s inside will dry .
So , we all exist within a kind of social and cultural circle .
That &apos;s how we all are .
We &apos;re born into a family , a nation and a certain class .
But if we don &apos;t have any relationship with the world that goes beyond the world that we take for granted , then we also risk drying from the inside .
Our ability to imagine can shrink . Our hearts may wonder , and our humanity may be ahead of if there &apos;s too much time inside our cultural rains .
Our friends , our neighbors , colleagues , family — all the people inside our inner circle are similar to us , that means that we are surrounded by the reflection of ourselves .
And another thing that women like my grandmother do in her hierarchy is to cover mirrors in a capsule or give them up on the walls when a stone is turned out .
This is an ancient eastern tradition based on the wisdom that it &apos;s not healthy for a human to spend too much time in the reflection of itself .
Ironically , &#91; to live in &#93; communities with sharp perceptions is one of the largest dangers in the global world today .
And it happens everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and beliefs , rich and poor , East and West as one .
We tend to group groups based on imagination , and then set stereotypes on other groups of people .
I think one way to transcend these cultural ghettos is through the art of the story .
Stories can &apos;t crack borders , but they can shake holes in our mental walls .
And through these holes , we can see the light of the other , and sometimes even love what we see .
I started writing a story at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a Turkish friend and asked me if I wanted to write a personal journal .
In retrospect , I think she was a little worried about my slides .
I used to tell endlessly stories at home , which was good , except the fact that I used to tell it to my imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
I was a child introverted until I talked to my painting colors and apologized to objects when I encountered them , and so my mother thought it was a good thing for me to express my experiences today and my emotions .
What disappeared from her eyes is the fact that I thought my life was very boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was write about myself .
Instead , I started writing about other people and things that never happened .
And so , I &apos;ve had this long passion for writing a story .
So at the beginning , a story for me was less of an autobiographical expression and more of a meaningful journey , to other people &apos;s lives , to other possibilities .
And please , go with me . I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to the point .
Now , another thing happened at the exact same time .
My mother became diplomatic .
And so , from my grandmother &apos;s neighborhood , the tiny , ever-faithful beliefs , from the middle class , I was suddenly experimenting with an internationally visited international school , when I was the only one .
Here it was my first encounter with what I call &quot; &quot; representative strangers . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children all over the nation , and yet , this diversity didn &apos;t necessarily lead to a systematic , cosmological , cosmological democracy .
Instead , this is an atmosphere where every child is perceived , not as a single individual of its kind , but a representative of something larger .
We were as the United Nations Miniatorship , which was fun , except when something negative happened related to nation or religion .
The child who represented these countries was implemented to swallow , had a bad ratio and endlessly screaming .
And I &apos;m supposed to know that , because at the time I signed up to school , military assignments were made by my country , a native female almost murdered the epilepsy , and the church got zero points in the archaic competition .
( Laughter ) I was missing many lessons and dreamed of becoming a seaweed in those days .
At the same time , I also tasted the taste of stereotype .
The other kids asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Express of midnight , &quot; &quot; which I didn &apos;t see . They were studying how many cigarettes I smoke a day , because they thought all the values were heavy smokers , and they wondered what age I would have to cover my hair .
I came to realize that these were the three main stereotypes on my country , politics , cigarettes and toxicity .
After Spain , we moved to Jordan , Germany and again to Andra .
Wherever I went , I felt that my imagination was the only suitcase I could carry with me .
Stories helped me feel the way , the continuity and consistency , those are the three &#91; in English &#93; that otherwise would have been missing to me .
In the middle of my 20s , I moved to Istanbul , the city that I admired .
I lived in a diverse , diverse neighborhood where I wrote some of my books .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake happened in 1999 .
When I escaped the building at three o &apos;clock in the morning , I saw something that stuck me in my place .
There was a grocery store there — an old man and a forger who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t talk to the margins .
Sit down to the side of a trench with a black , long , long lunchy , and the ceiling went down to her life .
I saw the man opening a cigarette package in the hands shaking and offering her one , and this is the image of the earthquake as I see it today — a conservative nerd and a cranstott crying smoking on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and the modern destruction today between humans evaporates , and we all become one even if only for hours .
But I &apos;ve always believed that stories have a similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not saying that the story has the power of an earthquake , and yet , when we read a good book , we abandon the little , warm apartment behind , and leave into the night alone and start to recognize people we &apos;ve never met and maybe even been biased as a blood .
Soon after that , I moved to a women &apos;s college in Boston and then in Michigan .
I experienced a change that wasn &apos;t necessarily geographic change as it was a difference to the difference .
I started writing a English story .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , a refugee or a pill . They asked me why I was doing it , but the replacement between languages gave me the possibility to recreate myself .
I like to write in a piece , which I think is very poetic and very emotional , and I like to write in English , which for me is very mathematical and connected to the brain .
And therefore , I feel that I &apos;m connected to any language in a different way .
For me , as well as millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
When you learn a new language at a late age , what happens is you &apos;re in a continuous and permanent sense of frustration .
As adults , we want to say more , you know , tell a better joke , say better things , but we find ourselves saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
And this gap is very threatening .
But if we draw courage not to fear it , it also has something that &apos;s devastating .
And this is what I found in Boston — that frustration was very devastating .
At this point , my grandmother , who kept me all the way through my life in an increasing concern , started adding on her daily prayers to get married because I &apos;ll marry so I can build one and always .
And because God likes it , I did .
( Laughter ) But instead of being established , I moved to Arizona .
And because my husband in Istanbul , I started on fixed journeys between Arizona and Istanbul , the two places on Earth that cannot be different from each other .
I think that part of me has been since Hollywood , physically and spiritual .
The stories shocked me , kept my part and memories together , like there was an existential glue .
However , even though I love very many stories , recently , I also started to think that they lose maximum if and when a story gets caught more than a story .
And this is a topic that I &apos;d like to think about together with you .
When my first novel in English came out in America , I heard an interesting note from a literary critic .
&quot; I loved the book , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; But I would love you to write it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at the book . It has so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters , but there &apos;s only one setup figure and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; So , the story takes place at a university campus in Boston , and therefore , for me it was normal to have more nationality characters in it in relation to the labels . But I realized what my controller was trying to find .
And I also realized that I would continue to disappoint him .
He expected to find a photograph of my identity .
He expected to find a woman supportive in the book because I found myself that way .
We talk frequently about how stories can change the world , but we need to look at how the world of identical politics affects how stories are distributed , read and controlled .
Many friends feel the pressure , but friends who are not Western feel it even more .
If you &apos;re a writer from the Muslim world , like me , expect you to write the stories of Muslim and voluntary women , their sad stories of sad Muslim women .
You &apos;re expected to write stories that are informative , special and typical and leave the experimental and the avandian for the Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a kid at the Madrid School is now in the world of literature .
Syrians are not perceived as creative people by themselves , but as representatives of the civilizations that come from , some of the friends from China , some of the Turkey , some of Nigeria .
We all expect to have something very different , if not weird .
The author and the journeyman , James Boldwin , gave an interview in 1984 where he was asked again and again about his homosexuality .
When the interviewer tried to categorize him as a gay writer , Boldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But you don &apos;t see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that there is no other person , and there &apos;s nothing in every other person who doesn &apos;t have in me . &quot; &quot; When identification politicians try to tagging us in the tags , the possible danger is for our freedom of imagination .
There &apos;s a vague category called multicultural literature where all of the friends outside the Western world are all mixed together .
I &apos;ll never forget my first reading , at Harvard , about 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one of the Philippines , one from Turkey and one from Indonesia — like the beginning of a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason they brought us together is not because we were co-authoritarian or literary flavor .
It was just because of our passports .
Cultural authors are expected to tell their true stories , and not necessarily the imaginary .
The fact is perceived as an invention .
In this way , not only are the authors themselves , but even their invented characters perceived as representatives of something larger .
But I have to immediately add that this trend to see the story more than a story does not just come from the West .
It comes from everywhere .
And I experienced this firsthand when I was held to trial in 2005 because of words that said figures in numerous evidence .
I meant writing a built-in novel and I wrote about a German family and a woman &apos;s eyes .
The little story became a big deal when I was prosecuted .
Some have visited me , others have chosen me about writing about the Archiatric conflict .
But there were cases that I wanted to remind both sides that this was a fiction .
It was just a story .
And when I say &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to underestimate my work .
I want to love and celebrate the story for what it is , not as a means of achieving purpose .
Scientists are entitled to be political positions , and there are very good political affairs on the market , but the story language is not a language of ecological politics .
Chauv said , &quot; &quot; The solution to the problem and the right way to formulate the question are two totally separated things .
And only the second of the two is the responsibility of the artist . &quot; &quot; The identity politics separates us . The story connects .
One is interested in total inclusion .
The other is , in thin differences .
One is drawing boundaries .
The other one recognizes the absence of the border .
The identical politicians are made of solid bricks .
Storytelling is abundant water .
In the Amanian Age , there were nomadic storytellers called &quot; &quot; Made , &quot; &quot; they used to go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story to the audience of the residents , sometimes improvising .
With the addition of another character to the story , the fabric changes their voice , mimicking the same character .
Everyone was invited to come and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the Sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
The stories crossed through all borders , like &quot; &quot; Joshua stories , &quot; &quot; which were very popular across the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
Today , the stories continue to rise above borders .
When Palestinian politicians and Israelis talk , they don &apos;t often listen to each other , but , a Palestinian reader still calls Romans of Jewish friends , and in the opposite , they connect and discover empathy to the figure of the barbershop .
It &apos;s about the literature to carry us beyond .
If it can &apos;t take us there , it &apos;s not a good literature .
Books saved the introverted , shy girl , who I used to be .
But at the same time I &apos;m aware of the danger of their blind love .
When the author and the mystic , Roman , met his spiritual colleague , who had been raped by a Theresez , one of the things that the last thing he did was turn Roman &apos;s books into water and look at melting letters .
The monkeys say , &quot; &quot; The knowledge that doesn &apos;t take you beyond dangerous yourself is even more ignorant . &quot; &quot; The problem with the cultural ghettos that we have today is not knowledge . We know a lot about each other , or so we think , but knowledge that doesn &apos;t take us beyond ourselves , makes us elite , distant and paralyzed .
There &apos;s a metaphor I love : living like a celebration .
As you know , one leg of the celebration is moving in place , static in place .
And at the same time , the other leg draws a large circle , moves continuously .
And so is my story .
One part of it is stuck in Istanbul with strong luxury roots , but another part of it is migrated in the world , connects to different cultures .
In this sense , I like to think about my stories both as both cachalects and universally , stories that are &quot; &quot; from here &quot; &quot; but also &quot; &quot; from everywhere .
Those of you who have been in Istanbul and have probably seen Armon Tokafi for over 400 years .
In the palace , just outside the living space of the most favorite sessions , there &apos;s an area called the Gennian Enlightenment .
A region between buildings .
I &apos;m fascinated by this idea .
We &apos;re usually suspicious of these areas that fall between categories .
We see them part of the supernatural area , just like the Jennie , made out of a smoke fire and symbolizes the elusive .
But my point is , perhaps , that elusive region is what writers and artists need more than anything .
When I write a story , I nurture the elusive and the ability to change .
I love not to know what &apos;s going to happen in 10 pages .
I love when my characters surprise me .
There &apos;s a possibility that I &apos;ll write about a Muslim woman in one story , and it might be a happy story , and in the next book , I can write about a jealous and gay professor in Norway .
As long as it comes from our heart , we can write about everything .
Odori Lord once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &quot; &quot; I think , therefore I am . &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think this is a great shift in the mindset .
And yet , why is it that in courses of creative writing today , the first thing we teach students is to write about what they know .
Maybe it &apos;s not the right way to start .
Design literature is not necessarily writing about what we know and what we know or about our identity .
We need to teach young people , and we also have to extend our hearts and write about what we feel .
We have to go out of our cultural ghetto and visit the next to him and the one after him .
Eventually , stories move like surfing Darwinians , drawing circles inside circles .
They connect all of humanity , regardless of the politics of identities , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I &apos;d like to end with an ancient Sufi song . &quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s make a difference ; let &apos;s make our lives simple ; let &apos;s make our love and love ; the ground will give up to anybody . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m Jane McGuganiel . I &apos;m a game designer .
We do achieve more in game worlds .
So , up until here , all the gamers in Warcraft and Warcraft together spent 5.93 million years solving the Virtual problems of zones .
It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
We &apos;re evolving into a more collaborative and playful species .
And as a result , social connections are actually more powerful .
Five million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
His work is brilliant . He &apos;s looking at why .
But it &apos;s not , in any way , an optimal situation .
We need to make the real world more like play .
Before we had great joysticks , we had sheep joints .
People were suffering . People were quoted .
It &apos;s really exciting .
According to the Rodontos , then the king decided to play a final cube game .
We want to imagine 2,000 wins , and then let people get the tools to get the final triumph .
We created this game in 2007 .
It &apos;s a story and an amazing journey that you can participate in .
We have a graphic disability . We have to go up high levels in properties like local insight , knowledge networking , survival , vision and resourcefulness .
The dirty work team and I were called a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
It &apos;s small — just a few square kilometers ; it &apos;s in the Rocky Mountains .
The spoken work was sheep farmer .
My role in the program — for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — is pretty simple .
I &apos;m a specialist , and I work with people who really do the spoken work .
I &apos;m just supposed to try and keep up and report yes about what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their lives .
The work in the program this time — sheep sprawl . Great .
We went to Craig and we got into the hotel and the next day I realize that Siros is going to be at the center of this work .
Now , usually , I never do a precursor study .
But , it &apos;s a sensitive subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to show everything we do properly , and we certainly want to do it by protecting a lot of respect to live .
So I called HUMANE SOCITY and I say to them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to screw some patches , can you explain to me how this works ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s pretty simple . &quot; &quot; They use Google — actually rubber rubber , like that &apos;s a little bit smaller .
It was actually around the card package I got yesterday , but it &apos;s because of what I know .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what is the procedure exactly ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You put the rubber to the tail , very accurately .
And then another tea is attached to the testes , in a precise way .
The blood flow slows down to slow down , and a week later the spoken parts fall .
&quot; Great ! I got it ! &quot;
Okay , I call the animal youth Society , to make sure — and they associate it .
I also called PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it , but they confirm it .
Okay , so that &apos;s actually the way to do it .
So the next day I come out .
I get a horse and we go out and get the pups and we take them to the clinic that we built , and we start to do live interface management .
Melini is Albert &apos;s wife .
Albert is the speaker .
Melini lifts the notes — two hands — one hand holds the right legs , and the left legs .
The lamb comes up on the column , it opens it up .
Okay , great .
Albert comes in , I join Albert , the team around us .
I always look at the procedure once , before I try it .
As an intern , you know , that &apos;s how you do .
Albert Run to pull out of the pocket , you know , black rubber but what comes out of the place is a knife .
And I &apos;m like , knife is really unrubbed , you know .
And he was like this , opening it up in a way that captured the sun that had just gone up over the rock mountains , and it was very — it was — it was very impressive .
And within two seconds of value , Albert held a knife between the band-tailed cartilage , right next to the bat of the toss , and very quickly , the tail was no longer , and suddenly found a bucket that I held .
A second later with a big thumb and a finite finger , he held the dark bag , very strongly .
And he pulled it in his direction , like this , and he took the knife and put it on the edge .
Now you think you know what &apos;s going to come , Michael ... but you &apos;re not .
Okay , he cuts it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the darkness , pulls it up , and then his head goes down , blocks my sight field , but what I hear is a kind of suction sound , and noise that sounds like a Scotch canvas that gets stuck from a sticky wall and I &apos;m really not kidding .
Can we play the video ?
No ... I &apos;m kidding — we &apos;re not — ( Laughter ) I thought it would be best to talk dramatically .
So , I &apos;ve done something I &apos;ve never done in photographs of the program , never .
I say , &quot; &quot; Stop of time . Stop . &quot; &quot; You know the program , we take it all in one scene , we don &apos;t take photographs .
No writing , no script , no nonsense .
We don &apos;t control , we don &apos;t rehearse , we take what &apos;s going on !
And I say , &quot; &quot; Stop . It &apos;s crazy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , you know ...
( Laughter ) It &apos;s crazy .
We can &apos;t do that . And Albert says , like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I say , like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened right now , but there are estimates in this pattern and it &apos;s not the way we do it . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the way we do it . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it that way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even give him a chance to explain , I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to do that in the right way .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make a chip and bleed — we &apos;re transmitted in five continents , man .
We sing twice a day at the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box , and he pulls a bag with little rubber rubber rubber .
Melini lifts another lamb , puts it on the column , the rubber goes on the tail , Gommia goes on the darkness .
The toss goes down to the floor , the toss takes two steps and falls , lifts up , shakes a little bit , takes two more steps , again falls down .
And I &apos;m , like , it &apos;s not a good sign of this task , at all .
It lifts up , goes to the corner , shakes , and it &apos;s lying on the floor , in a clear distress to the eye .
And I look at the toss and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
When will he wake up again ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Day . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Day ! How long does it take for the dates to fall ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Week . &quot;
Meanwhile , the toss that passed the victory , you know , jumping around us , the bleed stopped .
And he &apos;s , you know , blocking some grass , spinning .
And in that second , I was just amazed how wrong I was , in that second .
And I remembered how deeply wrong I was , huge chapters from time .
( Laughter ) And in particular , I remembered how lucky I am that day because now I have to do what Albert did , and there are about 100 patches in the clinic , and all of a sudden this process starts to appear to a German porn movie , and I &apos;m like , Marie Merrilla Tella , puts it on the page , opens it up .
Albert reaches me the knife .
I go in , the tail goes down .
I go in , grab the kiss , the tip goes down .
Albert guides me , &quot; &quot; Turn it up to the top . &quot; &quot; I do that .
&quot; Move more on top . &quot;
I do that .
The testes are discovering , they look like thumbs , cloned to you , and he says , &quot; &quot; Bring them down .
We &apos;ll just pull them . &quot; &quot; And I hear him , I hear all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how — how did I get here ?
How — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
( Laughter ) This is one of those moments when the brain is turned off and all of a sudden , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rocky Mountains , and all I can think about is the definition of tragedy by Aristotle .
You know , Aristotle said that tragedy is the moment when the hero is present , face-to-face , its real identity .
( Laughter ) And I say , like , &quot; &quot; What is this glamorous metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I think right now . &quot; &quot; I — I can &apos;t get this thought out of the head , I can &apos;t get this picture out of my eyes , so I did what I had to do .
I bought and climbed them in my mouth .
I took them like this , and I pulled my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testes on the chin .
( Laughter ) Now I — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
Okay , I &apos;m still poetic , in Aristotle , and I think — from a place there have been two concepts in my head that I haven &apos;t heard them since the classic university professor put them in there .
And they &apos;re Anonymous and Prífuna .
Anonymous and Prífuna .
Anonymous is the Greek word for discovery .
Literally , the transition from girls to education is Annuguises .
What our network does is what dirty jobs are .
And I &apos;m influenced by Annuguises every day .
Great .
The second word , &quot; &quot; Priya , &quot; &quot; is the moment in the great Greek tragedies , you know — Europides and Soppers — the moment Adipus has his moment when he suddenly discovers that the piece that he &apos;s lying with and making children with her is his mother . Okay .
It &apos;s a primate or a primate .
And this metaphor in my head — I have an Anonymous and Parithia on the chin .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , it &apos;s really a huge trick .
When you start looking for Parithia , you find it everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Williams in the movie &quot; &quot; The Seventh Fourth , &quot; &quot; right ?
I spend the whole movie trying to help the little boy who sees dead people , and then , boom — hey , I myself die &quot; &quot; Parithia &quot; &quot; .
You know ?
It &apos;s destroyed when the audience sees it in the right way .
Nio , in the movie &quot; &quot; Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
Oh , I live in a computer program — it &apos;s odd .
These discoveries bring to insights , and I &apos;ve had them , more than 200 dirty jobs , I &apos;ve got them all the time , but that — that &apos;s where I got something to my head in a way that I just wasn &apos;t ready for .
And as I stand there , I look at the baseball unemployment that I just tasted it — but it looks OK .
And when I looked at the other poor thing that I was working on in the right way and I was just amazed and thought if I was wrong with it — if I was wrong with it — and if I was wrong often , verbally , what are other primitive perceptions that I could respond to ?
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who is .
And I talked to him .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey , Mike .
I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in things like this or not , but have you noticed that you &apos;ve taken every country and country in the United States ?
A mining worker , a fishing worker , worked in steel , worked in every major industry .
You &apos;ve worked together with all these guys that our politicians desperately need to communicate with them every four years , right ? I still see Hillary taking photos with skyscrapers on Santa , next to the workers in the steel industry .
I mean , these are the people I work with everyday .
And if you have something to say about their opinions , inclusively , maybe it &apos;s time to think about it .
Because you know , a person ... four years . You know , it &apos;s going through my head , extending on a spontaneous , thoughts jumping up here and there you go .
And after that day , the dirty jobs program didn &apos;t change much , in terms of what the program itself was , but it changed about , personally .
And now , when I talk about the program , I &apos;m not just telling the story you &apos;ve heard and 190 as it is .
I tell the story , but I &apos;m starting to talk about some of the other things that I just missed about , some of the other institutions about work that I &apos;ve just assumed are sacred , and they &apos;re not .
People with dirty jobs are happier than you thought .
As a group , they are the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start throwing &quot; &quot; looking for the working settlement &quot; &quot; and all these nonsense about happy workers .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are broken people working in untouchable jobs .
The workers who collect animals who have been raped on the roads , whistle themselves , I swear . You &apos;ve done it with them .
They have this amazing symmetry in their life .
And I see it over and over again .
So I started thinking , what would happen if we were to challenge some of these sacred cows .
Go with your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for 36 hours .
Go with your passion — what might be wrong with this ?
Maybe the worst advice I ever got .
( Laughter ) You know , go with your dreams and spread your leg , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard when I grew up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do in my life , but I was told that if I went with my passion , everything would go well .
I can give you 30 examples , here and now — Bob Comboss , the pig tower in Las Vegas who collected the food remains from the casino houses and feeds them to his pigs .
Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in what we don &apos;t eat its pigs at twice the rate of age , and it &apos;s what it is , a rich pig tower , and it &apos;s good for the environment , and it spends its days in this amazing server and it smells like hell , but the sky will cry it .
It &apos;s a beautiful living .
You ask him , go with your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he laughed at you .
This person was worth — recently offered him something like 60 million dollars for his farm and he refused , outside Las Vegas .
He didn &apos;t go with his passion .
He took a step back and looked where everyone goes and then went the other direction ... you know .
And I hear this story over and over again .
Matt Prand is a healer in New York City , Connecticut , who set up one day and discovered that his waste from his fruit is worth more than their milk , if he can exploit it it to create renewable organic trees .
Now , he sells them into the Walmart stores network .
Go with his passion — the person ... Come on .
So I got interested in passion . I started looking efficiently at effectiveness , as Tim talked before — there &apos;s a very big distinction here .
I started looking at the work of staff and the decisions , and actually all the latest articles that are called &quot; &quot; Posters &quot; &quot; are dependent with the magical art in settlement rooms around the world right now .
All of this — everything turned upside down .
Security , first safety .
This is — I go back to OSHA and PETA and the HUMANE SOCITY . What if OSHA were right ?
I mean , it &apos;s epilepsy , what I &apos;m going to say , but what if it really is third safety ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean seriously .
What I &apos;m going to say is that I appreciate my safety in these crazy jobs as much as the people I work with , but the ones that really work , they &apos;re not the ones that talk about first safety .
They know that there are other things that promote — the business of doing the previous work , the business of succeeding .
And I &apos;ll never forget — there in the Brong Sea — I was in a crustacean ship with the most deadly drum guys , with whom I worked in the first season .
We were about 150 kilometers from the coast of Russia , giant sea waves , 15 meters of height , green water washing the wheel room , right ?
The most dangerous environment I &apos;ve ever seen from my days , and I &apos;m with some guy , linking the barrels to the deck .
So , I &apos;m 12 meters above the deck , which is like looking down on the shoe , you know , and it does that in the middle of the ocean .
It &apos;s dangerous without words .
I &apos;m running down , going into the emergency room and I &apos;m saying , at a certain level of skepticism , &quot; A shame , OSHA . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Okins . &quot; &quot; And he points somewhere .
( Laughter ) But at that moment , what he said later , you can &apos;t say again in the 48 states of the United States .
You can &apos;t repeat it at any factory in a factory hall or a construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; My son — he &apos;s my age , by the way , and he calls me my son , I love it — he says , &quot; &quot; My son , I &apos;m a cancer survivor .
My responsibility is not to bring you home in life .
My responsibility to bring you home rich . ( Laughter ) You want to get home in life , it &apos;s about you .
And to go on that day , previous safety .
I was , like , so , the idea that we &apos;re generating in a false way — sort of a sense of antennae when all we &apos;re doing is talking about someone else &apos;s responsibility as if it &apos;s ours , and the other way around .
Anyway , a lot of things .
I can talk along the many small diagnoses that we did and the infinite list of ways that I was wrong about .
But , in the end , it &apos;s all about this .
I &apos;ve come up with a theory , and I &apos;m going to share with you two minutes and 30 seconds left .
It goes like this — we announced war on work , as a society , all of us .
This is civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , actually .
We weren &apos;t going to do that , and we didn &apos;t play with the mustache in some kind of Maculic way , but we did it .
And we fought in four fronts at least , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we present people work on TV , it &apos;s worth laughing .
If you have a plumber , it weighs 150 kilos and it has a stroke in a son , thanks .
You see it all the time .
This is what plumbers look like , right ?
We make them heroes , or we make them joke .
That &apos;s what television does .
We use dirty jobs not to do that , and that &apos;s why I do the job , and I &apos;m not cheating .
But , we announced a war on Madison Street .
I mean , so many ads coming out of there — in a message , what do we really say ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could go home a little bit earlier , if you could go to pension a little earlier , if you could pass a card at the end of the reserve a little bit earlier , everything &apos;s there , again .
Washington — I can &apos;t even start talking about the transactions and policies that have an impact on reality in the bottom row of shopkeepers , because I really don &apos;t know .
I just know it &apos;s a forecast in this war .
And right here , guys , Silicon Valley , I mean , how many people have an iPhone on them now ?
How many people have their Blackberry ?
We are networked . We are connected .
I wouldn &apos;t offer for a moment that something bad came out of the technological revolution .
In my life , not to this audience .
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that unimitated innovation is a total waste of time .
And no one celebrates imitation in a way that dirty work knows that it should be done .
Your iPhone , without these people that produce the same interface , the same circuit , the same board , over and over again .
All of this — this is what makes it possible , equally — like the genius that goes inside .
So we have a new toolbox , you know .
Our tools today don &apos;t look like websites and craters .
They look like the things that we &apos;re walking around with .
And then the general effect of all of this is the download to the edges of a lot of jobs .
And I realized — too late — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do another 200 of them , but we &apos;ll do as much as we can .
And I think the most important thing is to know and really meet face to face with the fact that I was wrong with a lot of things , not just the attraction on the chin .
I was wrong with a lot of things .
So we think — when I say we , I mean to myself — the right thing to do is to talk about a PR operation for work , physical work , skilled work .
Somebody has to be out there talking about the presumption benefits .
I &apos;m talking about grandfather &apos;s stuff . The things that many of us grew up on , but along the way , you know , we lost a little bit .
( President ) Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a big deal .
For this war , which I suppose existed , there are damages like any other war .
The first injury is infrastructure . The decline in prescription to professional schools is the other .
Every year , less electric , less carpenters , less plumbers , less welfare , less warriors , less heat technicians .
The infrastructure jobs — everyone talks about their creation is these guys . Those who were at the top , over and over again .
Meanwhile , we have two trillion dollars , at least , according to the American Association of engineers , that we need to spend to influence , even a little bit , in the infrastructure that currently represents almost fail .
If I was to deal with some role , and I &apos;m not going to do that , I would just say that the jobs that we hope to find and the jobs that we hope to create will not stay if they &apos;re not jobs that people want .
And I know the purpose of this conference is to celebrate things that are close to us and are expensive to us , but I also know that clean and dirty are not the opposite .
They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and mimicry , like risk and responsibility , like Princia and Anthrouss , like this poor toss , which I hope is no longer shaking , and like my time you &apos;ve been drinking .
It was fun to talk to you now to come back to work , OK ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unleash a billion big ideas that are currently resembling in us .
And my little idea to do that is to change .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a room full of A-type women . It &apos;s a room .
Of dark women changed .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Two and a half years ago , I flew from triangles .
I hit my head at the table , and I broke my cheek bone , I have five seams on my right eye .
And I started a journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
And during that , I learned , I met doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive life , more inspiring , happier life is to sleep enough .
( Applause ) And we women will lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
We &apos;re going to change our way to the summit , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , men from sleep deprivation became the male symbol .
I recently founded dinner with a guy who turned out to have only four hours a year in the previous night .
And I felt like I wanted to tell him — but I didn &apos;t say — I wanted to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you were five years old , this meal was much more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s now a kind of competitive sleep sandwich .
Especially here in Washington , if you try to establish a breakfast meeting , and you say , &quot; &quot; What do you say about eight ? &quot; &quot; They typically say to you , &quot; &quot; Eight in the morning it &apos;s late for me , but it &apos;s okay , I can put in a tennis game and do some conversations and conference and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means they &apos;re so busy and productive , but the truth is that they &apos;re not , because we &apos;re at the moment in politics .
So high IQ .
It doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is the ability to see the glacier before it hits the Titanic .
And we had too many glaciers that hit our Titanics .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers were the brothers and sisters to fund , they were still with us .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy being connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister was in the glacier , because she would wake up from a seven-and-a-half year sleep and be able to see the big picture .
So when we &apos;re faced with a multifaction of the crises in the world right now , what &apos;s good for us at a personal level , what will bring more happiness , grateful and effective in our lives and be best for our career , is also what &apos;s best for the world .
So I urge you to close your eyes and discover the big ideas inside of us , turn off the motors and discover the sleep force .
Thank you .
( Applause )
As Chris said , I study the human brain — the functions and structure of the human brain .
I want you to think for a minute what that means .
We have an organ that &apos;s 1.2 kilos of a jelli that can hold on the palm of the hand , and it can capture the space of space between a star .
He can have an infinite debate and he can think of himself being achieved by infinity .
This recursive thing is called self-awareness , I think it &apos;s the Holy Grail of all neuroscience , and maybe one day , hopefully , we can figure out how this happens .
So how do you study this mysterious organ ?
We have about 100 billion neurons , small arms of Protoplasma , interacting with each other , and this activity creates a huge range of capabilities that we call human awareness .
How does this happen ?
Well , there are many ways to study the functions of the human brain .
One approach , which is very used , is to look at people affected by small areas of the brain , and there are genetic changes in very small areas of the brain .
What happens then is not a complete mimicking of all your brain capabilities , your mental ability .
What happens is a targeted loss of one function when all other functions remain correctly , and it gives us some confidence to assume that this region of the brain is somehow responsible for this function .
And then you can adjust a function to the structure , and find out what the brain links do to produce this function .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
Let me give you some amazing examples of this .
In fact , I &apos;ll give you three examples , each of six minutes , during this conversation .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
If you look at this picture here , here are the temporal lobes , the prosthetic lobes , the fractal lobes , the lights that make up the brain .
And here we are , hidden in the temporal lobes , as you can see here , a structure called the fusiform gyrus .
And this is what scientists call the brain &apos;s face area because when it &apos;s damaged , you can &apos;t recognize people &apos;s faces .
You can still recognize them by their voice and say , oh yeah , it &apos;s Joe , but you can &apos;t look at the face and see who it is .
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
You know it &apos;s you , because it bursts when you run , and you know what it shows , but you can &apos;t really identify yourself .
All right . This image is known as a result of brain damage to plant the character as a qualifications .
But there &apos;s a more rare syndrome , so rare that a few doctors know it , even neurologists .
And it &apos;s called the Capgras illusion , and it looks at normal patients in any other way that have brain damage , coming out of a coma , normal from every test , but looking at their mother and saying , &quot; This woman looks like my mother , but no , she &apos;s predicting .
She &apos;s another woman who pretends to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Why is that happening ?
Notice , this person is diving and intelligent from every aspect , but when he sees his mother , the illusion appears and claims that this is not his mother .
The most common interpretation of this , which you &apos;ll find in all the psychiatric books , is the Freudian interpretation , which is that this guy , and you can interpret the same for women , by the way , but we &apos;ll talk about men right now .
When he was a baby , a very small baby , he had a strong sexual appeal to his mother .
This is what &apos;s called the Preud Edipus complex .
I &apos;m not saying I believe that , but that &apos;s what Freud said .
And when you grow up , the cortex evolves , and you learn to contain the sexual impulses towards your mother .
Fortunately , you don &apos;t live sexually every time you see your mother .
And what happens is , after brain damage that falls in the skin , these hidden sexual impulses go out , go up to the surface , and suddenly , unexplained , you start to be sexually stimulated by your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s my mother , how do I live sexually ?
She &apos;s probably not my mother , she &apos;s predicting . &quot; &quot; This is the only rational interpretation of the damaged brain .
The Freudian interpretation never made sense to me .
It &apos;s kind of genius , like most Freudian interpretations — ( Laughter ) But it didn &apos;t make any sense because I saw the same illusion , which was patient relative to his tower . ( Laughter )
He said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , she looks like a pee , but she &apos;s not , it &apos;s just another dog .
We &apos;ll see you using the Freudian interpretation now .
( Laughter ) You start talking about the hidden substitutions in all human beings , or something absurd .
So what &apos;s really going on here ?
So to explain this strange image , we &apos;ll look at the structure and function of the visual system in the brain .
Normally , images come through the eyes , and move to the visual regions of the brain .
There are actually 30 regions in the back of the brain that are only targeted for vision , and after all of the processing , the data gets into a little structure , the fusiform gyrus , which perceives faces .
There are neurons there that feel faces .
You can call it the inside area of the brain , right ?
I talked about it before .
When the area is flawed , you can &apos;t see faces , right ?
But from this area the data goes into a structure called amygdala , inside the limbic system , the emotional center of the brain , and this structure , called amygdala , decides the emotional importance of what you look at .
Is it prey ? Is it crazy ? Is it a mate ?
Or is it something trivial , like a piece of next , or a piece of chalk , or — I don &apos;t want to point at it — or a shoe , or something like that , right ?
Something that can be completely ignored .
And if the amygdala lives , it &apos;s a sign that &apos;s important , and then the message goes to the autonomous nervous system .
The heart starts to dim faster .
You start sweating to disperse the heat that the body is going to get out of the muscle function .
And that &apos;s good , because we can put two electrodes on the hand and measure the changes in the skin &apos;s electrical conduction , as a result of the sweat .
So I can check , when you look at something , are you excited or living or not , OK ?
I &apos;ll come back to that in a minute .
So according to my theory , when this guy looks at an object , any object , and the picture goes to the visual regions and is processed in the fusiform gyrus , and he sees that it &apos;s a frozen plant , or a table , or his mother , say , okay ?
And then the data goes into the amygdala , and then the autonomous nervous system .
But for this guy , the link between the nervous system and the amygdala , the emotional center of the brain , is paralyzed in the crash .
And because the fusiform gyrus is correct , the guy is still going to recognize his mother , and he says , &quot; &quot; Okay , it looks like my mom . &quot; &quot; But because the link to the emotional center doesn &apos;t exist , he says , &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s my mother , how do I not feel warm in the heart ? &quot; &quot; Or horror , yeah ? depending on what mom .
( Laughter ) And then he says , &quot; &quot; How do I explain the absolute absence of emotions ?
It can &apos;t be my mother .
This is somebody else who pretends to be . &quot; &quot; How can we test this ?
I can take each of you and listen to you in front of a screen , and look at your skin &apos;s electrical conduction , when you see images on the screen , which is to see how sweating you see something . If it &apos;s a table or a try , you &apos;re obviously not sweating .
If it &apos;s a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a girl , you &apos;re sweating , right ?
And believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother if you &apos;re normal people , you start sweating .
You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on with this guy ?
You show him images on a screen and you look at his sweat .
Cats and desks and so forth , nothing , as usual , but even when you show him a picture of his mother , he &apos;s not harmful at all .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother , because the link between the visual regions and the brain areas is snumbled .
His vision is normal , because his visual center will install his emotions normal , he &apos;s laughing , he &apos;s crying , but the link between sight and emotion is cut , so he believes that his mother is a predictor .
This is a great example of what we &apos;re doing , taking a bizarre , bizarre and unimaginable neurological syndrome and assuming that the proprietary approach is wrong , and you can get to a more accurate explanation using the anatomy of the brain .
By the way , if that guy goes to another room , and his mother goes to him from the next room , he lifts the tube and says , &quot; &quot; Hey , Mom , where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no illusion through the phone .
Then she comes to him , and he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
You look like my mother . &quot; &quot; All right ?
The reason is that there &apos;s a separate trajectory that connects the auditory regions of the brain to the areas of emotions and it doesn &apos;t hurt the accident .
So on the phone he recognizes his mother without a problem .
And then face-to-face , he claims it &apos;s predicting .
All right , so how is this complex system built in the brain ?
Is it nature ? The genes ? The environment ?
We test this question with another syndrome called the Pantom organ .
You &apos;ve probably heard of the phenomenon of the Pantom organ .
When you give someone a hand or a leg , because of pollution , or someone loses a hand or a foot in war , the Iraq War , for example , which has become very problematic recently , it still continues to feel at the existence of the missing hand , and this is what &apos;s called a Pantom hand or a Pantom foot .
In fact , you can get a phantom in every organ in your body .
Believe it or not , even internal organs .
I had a patient who had a phosphorus surgery , and she had a phosphorus , including Panatomical cycle pain at the right time in the menstrual cycle .
And in fact , one student asked me whether she was also receiving a pre-psychatomic syndrome ?
( Laughter ) A very important subject to science , which we haven &apos;t yet done research .
Anyway , the next question is , what can we learn about the Pantom organs from experiments ?
One of the things we &apos;ve discovered is that about half of the patients with the Pantom organs say they can move the phenome .
Taking a brother on his shoulder , pick up the phone , wave to peace .
These are all very strong feelings .
The patient was not moved .
He knows that his hand is not there , but yet , it feels very powerful for the patient .
But in the other half of the patients , it doesn &apos;t happen .
The Pantom organ , they say , &quot; &quot; But Doctor , the Pantom organ is paralyzed .
It &apos;s squeaky and skeptical and it &apos;s painful .
If I could just move it , maybe the pain would free . &quot; &quot; Why would the Pantom organ be paralyzed ?
It sounds like oxymoron .
But looking at their documents , we found that for all of these with paralyzed Pantom organs , the original organ was also paralyzed by a nerve injury .
The nerves that drive the hand were hit were cut by a motorcycle accident , or something like that .
So the patient had a really painful hand that was in her dress for a few months or a year , and then in a false attempt to stop the pain , the surgeon took a piece of his hand , and then he got a pantom hand with the same pain exactly , right ?
And this is a very serious clinical problem .
People get depressed .
Some lose eventually .
So how do you handle this image ?
Why do they get a paralyzed Pantom organ ?
So it turns out that they had a real hand before the phantom , and their nervous system got cut , and the real hand got paralyzed , and she had a few months before the amputation , and then the pain continued after the amputation into the phantom .
Why is this happening ?
When the hand was still there , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands next to the front of the brain and says , &quot; &quot; Zoe ! &quot; &quot; But his eyes see that it &apos;s not moving . Zoe ! No moving . Zoe ! No moving . Zoe ! No moving .
And the brain learns this and sets it up , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; paralysis learning , &quot; &quot; OK ?
The brain learns , using the associative relationship of gold , that when it sends a command to move the hand , it gets a sense of a paralyzed hand .
And then , when the hand gets stuck , this learning paralysis is transferred to the body image and transferred by the phantom . Okay ?
So how do you help patients like this ?
How do you make the brain forget the paralysis that is learned so that it stops feeling the inevitable pain of the anatomic hand ?
So we said , what if we send the command to the phantom , and we give it a visual feedback as if the hand was moving ?
Maybe it will release the pain of the phantom , the shrunk .
How do you do that ? Well , with virtual reality .
But it costs millions .
So I found a solution that costs three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funders .
( Laughter ) What you do is you create a mirror box .
Cardboard and by showing you , and you put the Pantom — the first patient Derek came .
His hand was cut 10 years ago .
He had a shepherd of the knee nerve that was paralyzed and after a year was cut .
He had a Pantom hand with severe pain and he couldn &apos;t drive .
Hunt Pantom is paralyzed .
He came in and gave him a box and in it a mirror , as it was called a mirror box .
And he put the mad left hand on the left side of the mirror , and his right hand took off on the right side , in the same seasonal posture , and looked at the mirror , and what did he experience ?
He looked at the hand of the phantom came alive , because he was looking at the reflection of the healthy hand in the mirror , and as if the Pantom hand was resurrected .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I asked , &quot; &quot; Move the real fingers , watching the mirror . &quot; &quot; He of course would get the visual experience that the phenome moves .
It &apos;s clear . But the amazing thing is that the patient shouted so excited : &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phenome moves ! &quot; &quot; And the pain forgot . Remember , my first patient — ( Applause ) Thank you . My first patient came and looked at the mirror , and I asked , &quot; &quot; Look at the introduction of your Pantom . &quot; &quot; He started to go around and said , &quot; I see my phenome . &quot; &quot; But he doesn &apos;t know it .
It &apos;s just a mirror bubble , but it &apos;s still a convincing sensory experience .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move the healthy hand and the pantom . &quot; &quot; &quot; You know I can &apos;t drive the pantom , it hurts . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move the healthy arm . &quot; &quot; And he immediately said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe ! My penny is moving ! &quot;
&quot; And the pain was broken . &quot;
And then I asked , &quot; &quot; Awesome eyes . &quot; &quot; He made his eyes .
&quot; Move the healthy hand . &quot;
&quot; Cat — the hand is frozen again . &quot;
&quot; Okay , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
He was as happy as a kid in a candy store .
So I said , okay , this proves my theory of &quot; &quot; Learning paralysis &quot; &quot; and the overwhelming role of seeing it , but I won &apos;t get a Nobel Prize for getting someone to move a Pantom organ .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) If you think about it , it &apos;s a completely useless talent . ( Laughter )
But then I thought that maybe other kinds of paralysis like a stroke or a localized dystonia — could be a learned component that can be overcome by using a simple device like a mirror .
So I said to Drake — I mean , he can &apos;t walk around with his eyes all the time to light his shoulders — I told him , &quot; &quot; Take the look home and train a few weeks .
Maybe after training , you can let the mirror , eliminate the learning paralysis and start moving the paralyzed hand , and so you can relieve the pain . &quot; &quot; He agreed and took the mirror to his home .
After all , it &apos;s just two dollars . After two weeks he turned to me , and he goes , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you won &apos;t believe ! &quot; &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone ! &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I asked . I thought maybe the mirror box disappeared .
( Laughter ) &quot; The Pantom I &apos;ve had in the last 10 years .
Just disappeared . &quot; &quot; I started to fear , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;ve changed the image of the guy &apos;s body , what about the research ethics on human experiments and all that ?
So I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does it disturb you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What suddenly , in the last three days , I had no Pantom hand , so I didn &apos;t have pain in the elbow , in the frozen hand , and in the arm . All the pain disappeared .
The problem is that I still have the pantom fingers coming out of my shoulder , and the box doesn &apos;t get there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Can you change it and put it on my forehead so that I can get rid of the penny fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was a kind of magician .
Now , why did this happen ?
The brain is experiencing a significant sensory conflict .
On the one hand , he gets visual information that the phenome came back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no correspondence from the muscles saying there &apos;s no hand , right ?
And then there are motor commands that say there &apos;s a hand , and because of this conflict , the brain says , heck , there &apos;s no Pantom , there &apos;s no hand , right ?
Sort of denial — ignore the signals .
And when the hand disappears , the bonus is that the pain disappears because there may be no body pain floating in the air .
So this is the bonus .
This technique was based on dozens of patients by other groups in Lesinkie and it might be effective as treating the Pantom pain , and people also tried it to reconstruct a brain stroke .
Usually you think of stroke as damage to the neural fibers , and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
But there &apos;s probably a component in the paralysis of a stroke that is paralysis learned , and maybe it can be overcome with mirrors .
This is also in clinical trials , and it helps a lot of patients .
Okay , let me move a walk and move to the third part of the talk , and it &apos;s about another fascinating phenomenon called Syesthesia .
It was discovered by Francis Galton in the 19th century .
Charles Darwin &apos;s uncle .
He noticed that some of the population , generally they &apos;re perfectly healthy , has the next strange phenomenon every time they see a number , has color .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight vegetable , nine indigo and so on .
Notice that these people are completely normal in other ways .
Sometimes different sounds make colors .
Dazz is blue , here &apos;s green Diaz , another sound might be yellow . Okay ?
Why is this happening ?
Galton called it synesthesia , mixture of senses .
We have the senses distinct .
These people mix their senses .
Why is this happening ?
There are two interesting aspects of this problem .
First , this feature is family , so Galton said it has a inherited , genetic basis .
Second — and this brings me back to the central theme of the lecture — creative — synesthesia is eight times more frequent in artists , poets , writers and other creative people than in the rest of the population .
Why would it be like this ?
I &apos;ll answer that question .
We never answered her before .
Okay , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
So there are many theories .
One theory is that they &apos;re just crazy .
It &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so you can forget about it .
Another theory that they &apos;re bored , right ?
There may be something about this because the phenomenon is more common in the Gulf region than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) The third theory — let &apos;s ask ourselves , what &apos;s really going on in Santasia ?
So we found that the colors and the numbers are very close in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
So we said there &apos;s a accidental wiring between the regions of color and the numbers in the brain .
So every time you see a number , you see the color corresponding to it , so there &apos;s a synesthesia .
Why is this happening ?
Why would there be such a wiring in some people ?
Remember I said it was my family ?
That &apos;s the clue .
And it &apos;s that there &apos;s some exceptional gene , mutation in the gene that causes this exception .
All of us , it turns out , are born when everything is returned to everything .
Every brain region is connected to any other area , and these connections are transmitted to create the typical modular structure of the adult brain .
So if the gene responsible for this chromosome mutates , then you get a scaffold in the flow between nearby areas in the brain .
And if it &apos;s between the color regions and the numbers , you get a color synthesizer .
And if it &apos;s between the sound regions and the colors , you get a color synthesis .
That &apos;s how understandable .
Now , what if this gene is expressed in all the brain , so everything is wired to everything ?
Well , think about what artists have in common , writers and poets , their ability to do metaphysical thinking , to connect concepts that are seemingly unrelated like &quot; &quot; This is the east and Juliet is the sun . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Juliet is the sun . &quot; &quot; That means it &apos;s a burning ball ?
Sizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s another story , right ?
Healthy people say it &apos;s as warm as the sun , radiating , or nurturing as the sun .
You immediately find the connections .
So if we assume that the increased wiring is in different parts of the brain , then it will create an increased tendency for metaphorical and creative thinking in people with synesthesia .
And so synesthesia has eight times more common in poets , artists and writers .
This is a very brain view of Sinesthesia .
The last demonstration — can we do another minute ?
( Applause ) Okay . I &apos;ll show you all have synesthesia , but you &apos;re in denial .
Here &apos;s an alien alphabet . Just like our alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C .
Different shapes for different sounds . Okay ?
And here you have an alien alphabet .
One of them is Kiki and one is a puppet .
Who is who ?
How many think it &apos;s Kiki and it &apos;s puppet ? Hands up .
Well , one or two have mutations .
( Laughter ) How many think it &apos;s puppet and it &apos;s Kiki ?
Ninety-nine percent .
None of you have a alien , so how did you know ?
It &apos;s because you use synthetic abstract thinking . I mean , you say the nanoscale shape , and in the ear of these tricky hypotheses , you mimic the visual tune .
And it &apos;s very important , because it means that the brain creates something fundamental — it looks like a silly illusion , but the particles of light in the eye form , and the ear hypothesis cells form an audimentary pattern , and the brain can pull out the common ground .
It &apos;s a fundamental form of abstract thinking , and we now know that this is happening in a brain like the qualifications in the brain because when it &apos;s damaged , this ability loss of Kiki and the puppet , and also the metaphoric capability .
If we ask this person what it means to &quot; &quot; not all the Golden Rule , &quot; &quot; he would say , &quot; &quot; If it goes on and explodes , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
You have to consider it . &quot; &quot; Okay ? So they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
So this area is eight times larger than a few green mammals .
Something very interesting happens in this plant , and it &apos;s the intersection of hearing , vision and flexibility , and it &apos;s become huge in humans .
I think there &apos;s the basis for many unique human abilities like abstract thinking , metaphors and creativity .
All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for thousands of years , we scientists can begin to study by imagining a plant , and asking right questions for patients .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry about that ...
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
14 years ago , I first came across this simple material , a fisherman network , which has been used for hundreds of years the same thing .
Today , I use it to create permanent , transcendent , scalable sensuality of buildings in cities around the world .
I was an unlikely candidate to do that .
I &apos;ve never learned sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after college I tried to get into seven art schools and I was rejected by all seven .
I kept on being an artist , and I painted about 10 years , suggesting to me a Fulbright scholarship for India .
With a promise to get exhibitions of images , I sent my colors and I got to the glorium .
The exhibition target came — my colors didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
The fisherman village was known in his statues .
So I tried pieces in Ronze .
But to make big shapes was too heavy and too expensive .
I went on a trip on the beach , and I looked at the fishermen collecting their networks to piles on the sand .
I saw it every day , but that day I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a new way to create a mental form without heavy and solid materials .
My first supply sculpture was collaborated with these fishermen .
This is a self-portrait called &quot; &quot; broad hips . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) We put them on top of photography columns .
I found that their soft surface revealed every vine in the wind in the forms that change all the time .
I was mesmerized .
I kept studying art traditions and collaborating with Artians , then expressing tissue manufacturers .
I loved the subtle details that they gave to my work , but I wanted to make them bigger — to become an object looking at it for something that could be lost in .
When I went back to India to work with these fishermen , we created a network of a million and a half connections connected by hand — which was installed for a short time in the downhill .
Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the Ornist Manuel Sollers who redesigned the waterfront in Portto , Portugal .
He asked if I could build it as a permanent exhibit for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do it and keep my art .
Surveillance , engineered , fixed — all of these contrary to individuality , gentle and arrangement .
For two years , I was looking for a fiber that could survive in the ultraviolet glaciers , saltwater air , pollution , and at the same time it would last long enough to move freely in the wind .
We needed something that would hold the web in the air outside in the middle of the traffic circle .
So we lifted this steel ring at 20 tons .
We had to engineer it to move freely in an average pool and survive in the spirit of the hurricane .
But there was no engineering software to build a model of something so ventilating and moving .
I found a very careful aeronautical engineer who &apos;s designed for yachts to win the American Cup named Peter Hell .
He helped me deal with the double challenge of precise form and fine motion .
I couldn &apos;t build it the way I knew it , because hand links wouldn &apos;t stand in Hurricane .
So I developed a relationship with a factory to create fisheries , I studied the variables of their machines , and I found a way to make a competition with them .
There was no language to translate this ancient , unique manual into something that the machine operators could produce .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we showed the tissue network on the ground for 4560 square meters .
It was hard to believe that what I imagined was now built , permanent and lost nothing in doing .
( Applause ) This intersection was boring and anonymous .
Now she had a sense of place .
I went underneath it for the first time .
When I saw the choreography of the wind unfolded , I felt protected and at the same time , connected to boundless sky .
My life was going to change .
I want to create these desert landscapes of sculptures in places in cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share with you two new directions in my work .
The historical city house in Philadelphia : his square , I felt , needed a material to sculpture that was easier than a network .
So we tried tiny water particles to create a dry fog that gets shape from the wind , and in experimental we discovered that it can be shaped by people who can move in it without getting wet .
I use this sculpture material to mark the orbit of subway railways on the ground in real time — like X-rays that reveal the circulation of the city .
The next challenge , the Embassy of the Embassy in Denver asked if I could represent the 35 nations of the Western and connective half of them in the sculpture .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to start , but I said yes .
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that struck waves across the entire Pacific .
She moved the tectonic plates , accelerated the rotational speed and shortened the daytime .
So I called NOAA , and I asked if they could share their data on the tsunami , and I translated it into this .
And number two : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microns in which the day started .
I couldn &apos;t build it with a steel ring , in the way I knew it .
Her shape was too complicated now .
So I replaced the steel armor with a soft fabric , and still 15 times stronger than steel .
The statue could now be completely soft , which made it so easy that it could be connected to existing buildings — to actually be part of the city fabric .
There was no software that could design these complex shapes and build a model of them with gravity .
So we had to make it .
So I got a phone from New York that asked if I could match these ideas for Times Square or the High Line .
This new soft building method allows me to design and build these sculptures on a scale of skyscrapers .
They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I &apos;m dreaming now to bring them to cities around the world to where they need the most .
Fourteen years ago , I was looking for beauty in the traditional things , in the form of traditional art .
Now I combine them with high-tech and engineering materials to create sensual forms , negotiating on the scale of buildings .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a phone from a friend in Phoenix .
A lawyer in the office who had never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , carrying anyone she could from the building and pulled them out to lie under the sculpture .
They were there in the business suits , lying in the grass , and seeing the shifting patterns of the wind next to people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way you need to read this slide is to see your age on the horizontal axis .
After sexual adolescence , we drop out of the map .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
So when I was a kid ...
That was my team .
( Laughter ) I was really bad at sports .
I didn &apos;t like playing it , I didn &apos;t like watching it .
So that &apos;s what I did . I went to fish .
And for all of my adolescence , I grew up on the beaches of Connecticut , and these are the creatures I saw on a regular basis .
But after growing up and going to college , and I went home in the early &apos; 90s , that &apos;s what I found .
My team has shrunk .
It was literally like my team was destroyed .
And when I somehow looked at this , from a really personal perspective as a fisherman , I started to sort of figure out , well , what else did the world think about it ?
The first place I looked at was fish markets .
And when I went to fish markets , even though I was — whether I was in North Carolina , or Paris , or London , or whatever — I kept seeing these four creatures repeating themselves , over and over again — in menu , on the ice — shrimp , tuna , salmon , and dance .
And I thought it was very strange , and when I looked at it , I wondered , did somebody else notice this kind of market shrunk ?
And as a boy , when I looked at this , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team .
ordinary people , the way they looked at seafood was like this .
It &apos;s not a normal human trait to reduce the natural world to some individual elements .
We did this before , 10,000 years ago , when we got out of the caves .
If you look at the fire ignorance from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see bubbles , you &apos;ll see , you know , wolves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different creatures .
But if you look at that era telescope — you know , 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
It &apos;s true for birds as well .
You look at the menu in the restaurants in New York City 150 years ago , 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see Bretman , who is meant , dozens of ducks , dozens of geese .
But look forward to a generation of modern animal agriculture , and you &apos;ll see four : Indian chicken , ducks , chicken and geese .
So it makes sense that we went this way .
But how did we go that way ?
Well ...
First of all , it &apos;s a very , very new problem .
That &apos;s how we &apos;ve been discussing the oceans for the last 50 years .
The Second World War was a huge incentive to five ourselves in the fight of fish .
All the technology that we &apos;ve included in World War II — sonar , climate polymers — all of these things are turned towards the fish .
And so we see massive construction in fishing capabilities , square over time , from a Second World War end to this time .
And right now it means that we &apos;re taking between 80 and 90 million tons of the sea every year .
This is the equivalent of the weight of people in China taken from the ocean every year .
And this is not a case that I use China as an example because China is now the largest fish nation in the world .
Well , it &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is the amazing increase in farming and fish farming , which is now , just in the last year or two , has started to increase in the amount of wild fish that we produce .
So if you put the fish in the sea and the ones that grow in farms together , you get equal to two China that form from the ocean every year .
And again , this is not a case I used China as an example , because China , in addition to being the largest fish trap , is also the largest fish farmer .
So let &apos;s look at the four choices that we &apos;re doing now .
The first one — the largest seafood consumed in a big difference in America and most of the West , is shrimp .
A shrimp in nature — as a wild product — is a terrible product .
2.5 , five , seven and a half pounds of fish in nature are normally killed to bring half a pound of shrimp to the market .
They &apos;re also very energetically inefficient at coming to market .
In a recent study produced at Delhi University , it was discovered that the ambassador of shrimp capture is one of the most harmful fishing ways in terms of carbon you can find .
So you can grow them in farms , and people grow them in farms , and they grow them a lot in this area .
The problem is ...
The place where you grow shrimp is in these wilderness environments — in the forests mangrove .
Now look at these wonderful roots coming down .
It &apos;s the things that hold the ground , protect the beaches , create habitats for all kinds of young fish , young shrimp , all sorts of things that matter to the environment .
Well , this is what happens to many of the coastal mangrove forests .
We &apos;ve lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves for the last 30 or 40 years .
This pace of the field slowed down , but we &apos;re still in a serious mangrove shortage .
The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a phenomenon that the Mac Benjamin movie creator called &quot; &quot; Close Nemo . &quot; &quot; The phenomenon is very , very relevant to everything you &apos;ve ever seen on tropical variations .
Because because what &apos;s happening now , we have shrimp drains that live shrimp , catching a huge amount of vertebrate animals , the marginal animals are cut in the mast and become food for shrimp .
And sometimes , a lot of these tools — are threatened by slaves — grab what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; garbage fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we &apos;d like to see on the reef , grind them and make them food for shrimp — and literally live systems eat themselves and drop shrimp .
The second largest seafood in America , and also across the West , it &apos;s tuna .
So tuna is the ultimate global fish .
The vast management areas need to be tested so that tuna is going to be good .
Our management area , called the Asian fisheries Management Organization , is called ICAT , the International Committee Conservation International .
The great Netralist Carl Sina once called him , &quot; The International Fund to catch all the tuna . &quot;
Of course we &apos;ve seen extraordinary improvements in ICAT over the last few years , there &apos;s a big place for improvement , but remains to say that tuna is a global fish , and to manage it , we have to manage the world .
Well , we can also try to grow tuna , but tuna is an incredibly bad animal for agriculture .
A lot of people don &apos;t know that , but tuna is hot blood .
They can heat their bodies at 20 degrees above the environmental temperature , they can swim at over 70 kilometers an hour .
So it kind of eliminates all the benefits of fish growth , right ?
A fish grows in the farm is — or a fish with cold blood , or it doesn &apos;t move very much .
It &apos;s a great thing to grow proteins .
But if you have this wild wild creature swimming at 70 miles an hour and heating its blood — not a good candidate for agriculture .
The next creature — the most consumed seafood in America and the West — is salmon .
Now salmon also has its flash , but it doesn &apos;t necessarily happen through fishing .
This is my home in the state of Connecticut .
Connecticut was the home of a lot of natural salmon .
But if you look at the map of Connecticut , every point on the map is sugar .
There are over 3,000 sugars in the state of Connecticut .
I often say that &apos;s why people in Connecticut are so stressful — ( Laughter ) If someone could just unleash the Chase of Connecticut , I feel that we could have a much better world .
But I posted this particular note at a conference of national parks once , and this guy from South Carolina hunted at me , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t have to be so hard with your Connecticut , because ours in North Carolina has 35,000 sugars . &quot; &quot; So this is a national pandemic , it &apos;s a national pandemic .
And there are sugars all over the place , and these are exactly the things that stop salmon in nature from getting to their professor sites .
So as a result , we turned to aquaculture , and salmon is one of the most successful , at least from multiple perspectives .
When they first started growing salmon , it could take up to three kilograms of wild fish to produce half a kilograms of salmon fish .
The industry , to its credit , has increased enormously .
They came at least two to one , even though it &apos;s a little cheating because if you look at the way that aquaculture can be produced , they measure pathogens — kilograms per pound salmon .
These buttons in turn are corrupt fish .
So in reality — what &apos;s called the FIFO , a fish in a fish out — kind of hard to say .
But anyway , you can credit the industry , it lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon .
The problem is that we &apos;ve also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we produce .
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on this planet .
It grows sometimes by something like seven percent a year .
And so even though we do less fish to get it to the market , we &apos;re still killing a lot of these little fish .
And it &apos;s not just fish that we feed to fish , we also feed fish for chicken and pigs .
So we have chickens that are eating fish , but strangely , we also have fish that eat chickens .
Because the byproducts of chickens — feathers , blood , bones — are neglected and lost to fish .
So I often wonder , are there fish eating chicken eating fish ?
It &apos;s kind of rethinking the whole chicken and egg . Anyway — ( Laughter ) In total , however , the result is a terrible mess .
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million tons of wild creatures taken from the oceans and being used and tested .
It &apos;s equivalent to a third of China , or all the people in the United States taken from the sea every year .
The last of the four is kind of an amorphous thing .
This is what the industry calls &quot; &quot; white fish . &quot; &quot; There are a lot of fish coming into this white fish , but the way of sort of telling the story , I think , is through the classic piece of American Culinary invention , Sandwich Fish .
So Sandwich Fall actually started with the robot .
And he started because on a local franchise found that when he acquired his McDonald on Friday , nobody came .
Because it was a Catholic community , they needed fish .
So he went to Kay Crock and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to get you a sandwich fish , which is made of the robot . &quot;
Ray Crock said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it will work .
I want to do a Hollywood burger , and there will be a piece of rape inside the Germany .
But let &apos;s do it , let &apos;s intervene .
If his sandwich is going to sell more , it &apos;s going to be the winner sandwich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sad to the ocean that Hula Burger won &apos;t win .
So he did the Sandwich Hallbot .
Unfortunately , the Sandwich cost 30 cents .
Ray wanted the Sandwich to sell at 25 cents , so he turned to Atlantic code .
We all know what happened to the Atlantic Code in New England .
So now Sandwich , the fish is made out of Alaska , is the largest bluefin fish in the United States , one to 1.5 billion pounds of fish that find every year from the sea .
If we keep the Pollock , the next choice will probably be a therapy .
Tilphia is one of the fish that none of them heard about 20 years ago .
It &apos;s actually a very efficient conversion of a vegetable protein for an animal protein , and it was a rescue to the triple world .
It &apos;s actually a very sustainable solution , it goes from an adult egg in nine months .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it doesn &apos;t do what the West wants it to do .
It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called a fat fish profile .
It doesn &apos;t have the EPA and the DHA Omega-3 that we all think will make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the yellowfds ?
The fish that represents a huge part of 20 to 30 million of these tunas .
Well , one possibility that many conservatives have come up with is , can we eat them ?
Can we eat them directly instead of feeding them into salmon ?
There &apos;s a lot of arguments for this .
They &apos;re very energetically efficient to come to the market , a tiny fraction of the fuel of , say , shrimp , and at the top of the carbon efficiency scale .
They &apos;re also very rich in Omega-3 , a great source of EPA and DHA .
So that &apos;s potential .
And if we were to go down this path what I would say is , instead of paying a few dollars a kilo — or a few dollars per ton , really — and convert it into fish food , can we cut the fish and double the price to fishermen and make it our way of treating these particular fish ?
Other options , though , which is much more interesting , is to look at the oysters , especially in obstacles .
Now , high-value obstacles of EPA and DHA , they &apos;re similar to tuna in the box .
They &apos;re also very energetically efficient .
To bring a kilo of meals to the market is about one out of 10 of the carbon required to bring beef to the market .
They don &apos;t require fish from food at all , they actually get their number three by filing microalgae from the water .
In fact , where the Omega-3 comes from , it doesn &apos;t come from fish .
Microalgae creates Omega-3 , it &apos;s just biologically concentrated in fish .
Other hurdles and oysters do a huge amount of water filter .
A single waterfall can filter tens of gallons every day .
And this is incredibly important when we look at the world .
Right now , Niriptych , overuse the judgments in our waterways cause huge algae blooms .
More than 400 new dead areas have been created in the last 20 years , huge sources of death of marine animals .
We can also look at no fish at all .
We can look at the vegetables .
We can look at the algae , the brown sea algae , all the different kinds of things that can be rich in the Omega-3 , can be rich in proteins , really great things .
They filter the water just like obstacles .
And strangely , it turns out you can actually feed cows in them .
Now , I &apos;m not a big fan of cattle .
But if you want to keep growing visitors in time and where limited water resources , you grow algae in the water , you don &apos;t have to drink them — important consideration .
And the last fish is a question mark .
We have the ability to create fisheries that create a net advantage of marine protein for us .
The creature would have to be vegetarian , it would have to grow fast , it would have to be adapted to a changing climate and it would have to have a left-handed profile , the EPA , the DHA , Omega-3 sunny acids that we &apos;re looking for .
It kind of exists on the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these issues for 15 years .
Every time I do a new story , someone says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do all this . We can do this . We &apos;ve figured this out .
We can produce fish that are a positive advantage of marine protein and it has an oga 3 . &quot; &quot; Great .
It doesn &apos;t seem to increase the scale of this .
It &apos;s time to increase it .
If we do that , 30 million tons of seafood , a third of the world &apos;s fish , stay in the water .
So I guess what I &apos;m saying is that this is what we &apos;ve gone with .
We tend to walk with our appetite instead of our brains .
But if we go with it , or a kind of configuration of it , we might have a little bit more than that .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Sorry , thank you . It was fun .
Half my left brain , ours , is a completely different place .
Half our left brain is thinking linear and systematic .
And also , half of our left brain is thinking with language .
And all I could recognize is this energy , the energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? What &apos;s going on ?
And I felt lightweight in the body .
