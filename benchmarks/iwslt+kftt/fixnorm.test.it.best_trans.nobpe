By the end of this year , there will be about a billion people on this planet that actively use social networks .
The thing they all have in common is that someday they will die .
Of course , it might be considered a morbious thought , but I think it has profound implications that are worth exploring .
What first made me think about this is a post published in the beginning of this year by Derek K. Miller , a scientific and technological journalist who died of cancer .
And what Miller did was he wrote a post to his family and his friends that came out shortly after his death .
This is what he wrote when he started this thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post on my blog .
In advance , I asked myself that once my body had gotten rid of the cancer penis , my family and friends published this message that I wrote — the first part of the transformation process from an active site to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archives could have been written better and treated more carefully than most others , the fact is that all of us today are creating a completely different archive than ever been done by generations .
Let &apos;s take a moment to some statistics .
Today , they &apos;re uploaded to YouTube 48 hours of video every minute .
200 million Tweets are posted every day .
And the average user of Facebook generates 90 content per month .
If you think about your parents or grandparents , as far as they could have done , they would have taken some pictures or some videos , or a journal lying in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re creating this incredibly rich digital archive that will live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;ve gone .
And I think this will create incredibly fascinating opportunities for technologists .
To be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a tech expert , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is create a picture of how the present and the future will look .
We already see some services that are designed to make us decide what &apos;s going to be of our online profile and our social networking utility after our death .
One of them , and it couldn &apos;t be appropriate anymore , found me going into a foursquare restaurant in New York City .
( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Good morning .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : Death can take you anywhere , at any time , even to the biological ward .
AO : Who talks ?
Death : go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : From a brivid , right ?
So this service , very simply , gives you a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death .
Another new service is called 1,000 Memories .
And that allows you to create an online toll to the people you love , full of photos and videos and stories that can publish after your death .
But the next one is far more interesting .
Probably many of you have heard of Deb Roy who , last month of March , demonstrated that he could analyze over 90,000 hours of video .
I think , with machine capability to understand human language and process a huge amount of data all the time improving , it &apos;s going to be possible to analyze a whole life of content — of Tweet , of photographs , of videos , of posting on blogs — that we &apos;re producing in huge amounts .
And I think as this happens , it will become possible for our digital personality to continue to interact with the real world a long time after our departure with the enormous amount of content that we &apos;re creating and the capabilities of technology to make sense of everything .
We &apos;re already beginning to see some experiments .
A service called My Next Tweet is analyzing the chronology of your Twitter , everything you published on Twitter , to make predictions about what you might say next .
Right now , as you can see , the results can be pretty comical .
You can imagine what a thing like this might look like in five , 10 or 20 years with improving our technical skills .
As we move forward , MIT &apos;s average lab is working on robots that can interact as humans .
What if these robots could interact on the basis of the unique characteristics of a specific person based on hundreds or thousands of content that that person produced in their lives ?
And finally , go back to that famous scene of the 2008 election marathon in the United States , when CNN projected a living hologram of the hip hop will.i.am artist in the studio to interview Anderson Cooper .
And if we were able to use that same kind of technology to project a representation of our people care in our living rooms — that interact as if they were alive based on all the content they created while they were alive .
I think it will be absolutely possible because the amount of data that we use and the capabilities of technology to understand them are both expanding exponentially .
To close , I think we should all think if we want all of these things to be transformed actually — if that were , what does it mean in the definition of life and everything that comes next ?
Thank you very much .

The people who come back to work after interrupting their career , I call them Relauncher .
They &apos;re people who took a break to take care of old people , their children , focused on interest or some health problems .
Going back to work after a break is hard because of the disconnect between employers and these relauncher .
Working dators see the hiring of people with an interval in their television as a high-risk proposition , and these people can doubt their ability to start working , especially if they &apos;ve been absent for a long time .
This disconnect is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Now , the successful relauncher is found .
This is Sami Kafala .
A nuclear physicist working in the U.K. , who took a five-year break to feed his five children .
The Singapore press wrote that nurses come back to work after long periods of pause .
And in terms of long working breaks , this is Mimi Kahn .
Social Assistant in Orange County , California , who came back to work for a social services organization after 25 years of pause .
This is the longest break I know .
Sandra Day O &apos;Connor , the judge of the supreme court , took a five-year break in the career .
Instead , Tracy Shapiro took 13 .
Tracy was called for an Today Show poll based on people coming back to work that they encountered difficulty .
Tracy wrote that he had five children and loved the time he spent in his house , but after having passed for a divorce he needed to work , and in addition he really wanted to bring the work back into his life because he loved working .
Tracy was doing what many of us do when we think we &apos;ve done a good job job .
She was looking for a job to be accountable , and she &apos;d spent the last nine months carefully searching for online companies and doing labor demands , without any outcome .
I met Tracy in June 2011 when Today Show asked me if I could work with her to help her change things .
The first thing I said in Tracy was to get out of the house .
And to say publicly that she was looking for work and telling everyone who knew she was going to go back to work .
I said to her , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to have a lot of comparisons without any outcome .
It &apos;s normal , don &apos;t discourage you .
It &apos;s going to be a few of you who are going to take you to a work opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what happened in Tracy in a while , but before I tell you about a discovery I made when I came back to work after a 11-year-old break .
The idea that people make of you is like frozen .
That is , when you start to relate to yourself by connecting with people in the past , people you worked with or went to school , they will remember you as you were before your work break .
And it &apos;s just as though your self-esteem has gone down , as it happens to many of us when we &apos;re away from our professional identities .
So , for example , you can think of yourself that way .
This is me , a crazy woman after driving a minivan for 24h .
Or , here I am in the kitchen .
But those people in the past don &apos;t know anything about this .
They just remind you of what you were and it &apos;s a great drive for self-esteem to connect with these people and see them excited because you want to go back .
There &apos;s another thing that I remember intensely about this break .
And that is that I was hardly following the news of economics .
My training is financial , and I rarely followed news like this when I was home to badge my four children .
So I was afraid to do a interview and talk about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
I subscribed to the Wall Street Journal and read it for six months , page after page , before I was able to figure out what was going on in the finance world .
I think the relauncher is a resource in the professional world , and that &apos;s why .
Think about our life : those of us who took a break to badge our children , take a little or no maternity leave .
We &apos;ve been there before .
We move less for spousal reasons .
We have a more regular life .
We have a great working experience .
We have a more mature perspective .
We don &apos;t want to be on the dator .
The more we have an energy and an enthusiasm to go back to work just because we &apos;ve been away for a very long time .
On the other hand , when I talk to employers , two things worry about the hiring of the relauncher .
First of all , employers fear that these employees don &apos;t have the information knowledge .
I can tell you , having been technologically backwards , which is just a temporary condition .
I had done my financial analysis , a long time before I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
I don &apos;t know if anybody remembers it , but I had to relearn them on Excel .
And it wasn &apos;t that hard . Many commands are the same .
I found PowerPoint much more difficult , but now I use it all the time .
I tell the relauncher , that the dictators expect basic informatics .
And if they don &apos;t step up with time , it &apos;s their responsibility to equal .
And they do .
The other concern about employers is that the relauncher doesn &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell them they have to work hard to understand whether their interests and skills have changed or not during the workforce break .
It &apos;s not a job dator .
It &apos;s the relauncher who has to show the employer where it can be more useful .
Back to 2010 , I noticed something .
Since 2008 , I follow programs to go back to work and 2010 , I &apos;ve seen that there are short-term labor opportunities , which are called &quot; &quot; shooters &quot; &quot; or not , but which are like a tyranny , as a way for professionals to come back to work .
I saw that Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee set up stage for reintroduction in the company .
I saw an engineer come back , an anomaly candidate , ask for an army shot , and then get a full-time job .
I saw two universities inserting little pins into the mid-career academic programs .
So I wrote a report on what I saw , and a paper came from the Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; The 40-year-old season . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editor for the title , and also for the graphics where you can see a 40-year season among many college seasons .
And then , thanks to Fox Business News , they called this concept &quot; &quot; The 50-year-old season . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Five of the biggest financial institutions have stage for professional rehabilitation .
Hundreds of people joined you .
These stages are repaid , and those who go to fixed jobs are well repaid .
Today , seven of the largest engineers are running stage programs for the engineers as part of an initiative with Women &apos;s Society .
Why are companies using these back-tailers ?
Because the stage allows the employer to look at the hiring based on real work evidence instead of sitting here , and it doesn &apos;t have to decide definitively until the end of the stage .
This period of evidence eludes the risk perception that some managers attach to the hiring of the relauncher and are attracting excellent candidates who are then good workers .
Think about how far we got .
Before that , many employers were not interested in hiring the relauncher .
Now , not only are they creating specific programs for relauncher , but you can &apos;t even run if you don &apos;t have a vacuum in your CV .
This is the sign of a real change , of a real shift , because if we can solve this problem for the relauncher , we can solve it for the other employees as well .
A employee just told me that the veteran rehabilitation program is based on this kind of tyranny .
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retirement stage .
Several groups , same concept .
Let me tell you what happened to Tracy Shapiro .
She had to tell anyone who wanted to come back and work .
A conversation with another parent in his neighborhood brought her to a labor offer , as a matter of accountant in the financial sector .
But it was determined at the time .
They told her it was possible to turn into something more , but without guarantees .
It happened in the fall of 2011 .
Tracy loved this company and his colleagues , and the office was 10 minutes away from his house .
Even though he had received another offer from another company , at a time undetermined , decided to continue this stage , hoping for the best .
Something amazing happened , not only did they give them an undetermined time contract at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and more exciting because they knew Tracy could do it .
In 2015 , Tracy was promoted .
The company paid her a Master at night .
She also hired another speaker .
Tracy &apos;s initial work was a proof , just like a tyranny , and it ended up with a victory , both for Tracy and its dictator .
My goal is to introduce this kind of tyranny to a lot of employers .
But meanwhile , if you &apos;re going to go back and work , don &apos;t hesitate to ask a stage or something like a employer who doesn &apos;t have a official rehabilitation program .
Be their first success story , and you can be the example for the next relauncher .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to talk today about some unexpected discoveries .
I work in the industira of solar technology .
And my new company meant pushing forward in the direction of the environment by paying attention to ...
Be aware of crowdsourcing .
It &apos;s a little video of what we do .
Oh . Just a moment .
It takes a moment to upload it .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll do — we can jump — I &apos;ll move the movie back then ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
Oh , my time is already out ?
Okay . Thank you very much .

It was an afternoon in fall 2005 .
I was working at the ACLU as a scientific consultant of the organization .
I went to find my colleague Chris Hansen in his office .
I explained to Chris that I felt a little stuck .
I had looked at a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — very interesting .
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and biober , and ...
So what does that mean ?
It means that you don &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or she to look at it , let &apos;s say , to see if she has mutations , without permission of the patent title .
The company that got a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose syndrome .
But then they went to bankrupt and never offered it .
Brevets on genes were clearly a problem and damage patients .
But was there a way we could change them ?
And then not patenting natural products — air , water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t patent the laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
These things remain fundamental and they have to remain free to everyone and reserved only to anyone .
Why ?
And finally , the courts wouldn &apos;t be willing to revocate these patents .
So we &apos;ve been working on building our case .
The patents tend to be : Ditta A causes Ditta B to be a very dark and technical story .
Myriad received patent on two genes , BRCA1 genes and BRCA2 .
He forced a lot of labs that were offering BRCA tests to stop .
They asked a lot of money for their test — more than 3,000 dollars .
It was estimated that over this period , for many years , as many as 12 percent of women under the trial received a wrong result — a negative result that had to be positive .
This is Kathleen Maxian .
Kathleen Eileen &apos;s sister developed breast cancer at 40 and was tested by Myriad .
The test was negative .
The family was lifted .
But after two years , Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer .
It turns out that Kathleen &apos;s sister was among 12 percent who received the false negative result .
If Eileen had received the right result , Kathleen would have been able to examine , and her ovarian cancer could have prevented .
One of the biggest difficulties we had in preparing this case was to understand the best way to communicate science .
So to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and what isolated BRCA genes were natural products , we had to explain some basic ideas , like , what is a genius ? What is DNA ?
How is DNA isolated and why is that not an invention ?
And eventually we depended a lot on the use of metaphors , like gold .
So by isolating DNA — it &apos;s like pulling gold out of a mountain or taking it out of a stream .
You might be able to patent the mineral activity , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
He probably wanted a lot of work and hard to dig gold from the mountain , but not to patent it , and anyway gold .
And the gold , once it comes out , can clearly be used for so many things that you couldn &apos;t be used while it was in the mountain ; for example you can make jewelry — you can &apos;t patent yet , it &apos;s still gold .
So in 2009 , we &apos;re ready to present our case .
We presented it to the federal court in southern New York , and the case was randomly delivered to Judge Robert Sweet .
In March 2010 , Judge Sweet presented his wall — 152 pages — and a complete victory .
By reading the wall , we couldn &apos;t overcome the eloquence with which he described random science .
I mean , our instructions — they were okay , but not so good .
How did it develop a profound understanding of the question in a short time ?
We couldn &apos;t figure out what happened .
It wasn &apos;t just a scientist — he had a Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What a luck !
And then things got interesting .
First , at a crucial moment in case , the American government changed their minds . So in the district court .
So even with this incredible development , we expected to lose .
And we lost .
That &apos;s about it .
It ended up with a divided decision , two to one .
Myriad didn &apos;t even talk about it , so he suddenly jumped .
Usually these questions are formed in a super-long paragraph , like a whole page with many , many phrases , &quot; How here &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; so here . &quot;
We delivered perhaps the shortest question ever .
Four words : Human Genes are patents ?
When Chris asked me what I thought about these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;d like judges to have the same reaction that I had when you took me this issue seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
The Supreme Court only listened to about one percent of the cases it receives , and has accepted to give hearing to our own .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
The topic itself was fascinating .
The second quote is from the top .
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
Then you can make predictions and test them .
What do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole thing is literally more than the sum of its parts .
Where are economic networks ?
What we &apos;ve looked at in the details is property networks .
And we also assign value to the company .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we have 4,000 of them .
I &apos;ll explain this to you with an analogy .
Hi . Today I &apos;m going to show you eight of my projects done in collaboration with the Danish artist Soren Pors .
We call ourselves Pors &amp; Rao , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Phone Zio . &quot; &quot; It was inspired by the peculiar habit of my uncle to ask me to do things for him , almost as if I was an extension of his body — turn on the lights , bring him a glass of water or a package of cigarettes .
As I grew up , it got worse and worse , and I started to interpret it as a form of control .
But , of course , I could never have said anything because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
The situation that disturbed me and disturbed me the most was the use of a fixed phone .
He kept his phone next to his ear waiting for me to make a number for him .
So as an answer and gift to my uncle , I created &quot; &quot; The Phone Zio . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it takes two people to use it .
That &apos;s exactly how my uncle uses a phone designed for a person .
But it was a problem when I left my home to go to college , they started to send me his orders .
So I made him a golden typewriter through which he could give orders to his grandchildren all over the world through email .
What he had to do was take a piece of paper , put it in the cart , type in his email and order and then extract the paper .
This device would automatically send the letter to the recipient as an email .
Here you can see that we &apos;ve integrated a lot of electronics that can understand all the mechanical functions and convert them into digital .
So my uncle has only to do with a mechanical interface .
Of course , the object had to be very big and have a sense of ritualism , as my uncle likes .
The next piece is a sensitive sonic installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pigmei . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the idea of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive , sweet creatures .
It works like this : we have these panels hanging on the wall , and behind we have these little creatures hiding .
And as soon as there &apos;s silence , they crawl out .
If there &apos;s more silence , they also stretch the neck .
And at the least noise you hide again .
We had these panels on three walls in a room .
And over 500 of these little piges are hidden behind them .
Here &apos;s how it works .
This is a video prototype .
When there &apos;s silence , they come out of behind the panels .
They feel what humans do or real creatures do .
And after a while , they become immune to the sounds that scare them .
And they don &apos;t respond to the sounds of the background .
Now you &apos;re going to hear a train and they &apos;re not reacting .
( Sound ) But they respond to sounds in the foreground . You &apos;re going to hear it now .
( Whistling ) We worked a lot to make them more realistic as possible .
Each pigmeo has its own behavior , a mind , mood balls , personality and so on .
This is an initial prototype .
And of course , it was very improved .
They were designed to respond to people , but we realized that people were very infant and happy with them .
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Scomparison People . &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued by playing with the idea of invisibility .
How is it possible to experience an invisibility ?
We work with a game-specific company , and we asked them to develop software for us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow them and replace a person with the background , make it invisible .
Now I &apos;m going to show you a first prototype .
On the right side , you can see my colleague Soren who is physically in this space .
And on the left you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera made it invisible .
He enters the room . Pop ! He becomes invisible .
You can see the camera lists it as it follows its path .
It &apos;s a preliminary video , where overlap hasn &apos;t been processed yet , but it &apos;s been perfected a little bit later .
What we did was we put a camera in a room and a screen on every wall .
And when people walked into the room , they would see on the screen , but with a difference : one person remained invisible everywhere they moved into the room .
This piece was called &quot; &quot; The shadow of the Sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , a delay of a childhood drawing of an oil machine or a sun .
In front of it , this object seemed very strong and robust , while it was pretty weak .
So people would go around the room almost without noticing it , thinking it was a crap left around .
But as soon as someone passed , the wall started to come back uncertain .
He got tired and he fell every time .
( Laughter ) This work is a caricature of a man on his head down .
His head was so heavy , filled with heavy thoughts , that he fell into his hat and his body grew almost like a plant .
What it does is it moves like a head drunk down with an unpredictable and extremely slow motion .
And it &apos;s a little limited by that circle .
Because if it wasn &apos;t there , and the floor was perfectly uniform , it would start wandering into the void .
And there are no wires .
I &apos;m just going to show you one example — when somebody enters the room , the object is activated .
And very slowly , within a few minutes , it gets painful and then it earns ground and it feels like it &apos;s going to fall .
This is a decisive moment because we wanted to install in the viewer the instinct of wanting to go and help , save the object .
But he doesn &apos;t really need it , because , once again , he can recover himself .
This work was a real technical challenge for us . We worked hard , like in many of our work , over the years , to get the right mechanism , balance and dynamics .
It was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we did it so that it could fall , it would be broken , and if it didn &apos;t bend enough , it didn &apos;t create such fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
I &apos;m going to show you a very short video where we do a test scene — it &apos;s much faster .
This is my colleague who let him go .
Now it gets nervous and it &apos;s going to go get it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to do that because he can lift himself .
This is a piece that we found very intriguing . We worked with the aesthetics of the film where we put thousands of little fiber optics measures that shine like a stelled sky .
It &apos;s all done on the scale of the night sky .
We wrapped it around this massive shape of a teddy bear hanging from the ceiling .
The idea was to create a contrast between something very cold , distant and abstract like the universe , with the family form of a teddy bear that is very comforting and intimate .
The idea was that at some point you started to see it not as a form of a teddy bear but to perceive it almost as a hole in space , as if you looked at a sparkling , stelled sky .
This is the last work that &apos;s still working on called &quot; &quot; Spazio Resources . &quot; &quot; Imagine a little cube about this size sits in front of you at the center of the room , which as you approach it , it tries to intimidate you , doubling its height and quadrupling its volume .
This object expands and contracts all the time by creating a dynamic with the people moving around it — almost like trying to hide a secret inside or something .
We work with a lot of technology , but the truth is , we don &apos;t love it because it creates a lot of problems in our work .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us express emotions and patterns of behavior of these creatures that we create .
And once a creature comes to mind , it &apos;s like the process of creation is to discover the way the creature wants to exist , what shape it wants to have and how it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m here .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , otherwise it would be a little weird .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And with &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
But here .
I mean Earth .
Is Earth special ?
To understand whether there are planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that are suitable to life , the first step is to understand what life needs here .
Turns out , 8.7 million species , life needs three things .
On the one hand , life on Earth needs energy .
There are different sources of energy available on all the planets .
On the other hand , life needs food , nutrition .
A challenging request , especially if we want a tomato soup .
( Laughter ) However , all life on Earth is fed by six chemicals , which are on every planetary body of our solar system .
It holds that thing in the middle the most difficult thing to achieve .
Not the algae , but the water .
( Laughter ) Even though the hose wouldn &apos;t be bad . ( Laughter )
And not ice , not water in the taste state , but in the liquid state .
This takes life to survive , all life .
And many bodies in the solar system don &apos;t have liquid water , so we don &apos;t look for it there .
There are very few bodies to think about .
So let &apos;s try to simplify .
We just think about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
We need an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
We have to be very careful about that atmosphere .
It can &apos;t be too dense or too hot , otherwise you end up like Venus : too hot , and you don &apos;t have liquid water .
But if the atmosphere isn &apos;t enough , it &apos;s too thin and too cold , it ends up like Mars : too cold .
Number one : If Mom Orsa &apos;s bowl is too cold when the Golden Reconds enter the room , does it mean it &apos;s always been too cold ?
Or could it be perfect at another moment ?
The same is true of planets .
Nothing is static . They change .
They vary . They evolve .
And the atmosphere does the same .
Let me give you an example .
This is one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
This cannot happen on Mars today .
It changed from a state that we would call habitable , because the three requirements for life were long ago .
Where did that atmosphere that allowed water to be liquid on the surface ?
One idea is that it &apos;s escaped into space .
This is happening in every body with atmosphere .
It &apos;s just a matter of degree and scale .
We &apos;d like to understand how much it took with time to explain this transition .
The atmosphere from where does the energy come from ?
The particles , how do they get energy to get rid of themselves ?
First , sunlight .
Yes , I &apos;m dancing , but — ( Laughter ) Or my God , even my marriage . ( Laughter )
They take enough energy to escape and get rid of the gravity of the planet , just warming up .
A second way to take energy is from solar wind .
It &apos;s something that I &apos;m interested in , because it &apos;s connected to habitability .
I mentioned two things about the Golden Research story that I wanted to draw attention to and remember , and the second is a little bit subtle .
If the bowl of Dad Orsa is too hot , and Mom Orsa &apos;s bowl is too cold , the bowl of Orsect shouldn &apos;t be even colder if we follow the trend ?
This thing that you &apos;ve accepted all your life , if you think about it better , may not be that simple .
Of course , the distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
It has to play a role in habitability .
But maybe there are other things that we should think about .
Maybe it &apos;s the foods themselves that help define the end of the story , which is okay .
Earth has one ; Venus and Mars don &apos;t have one .
The magnetic fields are generated by the depths of the planet by a fluid conductor of electricity that creates this great magnetic field surrounding the Earth .
If you have a compass , you know where the north is .
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars , compliments , you &apos;ve lost it .
( Laughter ) Does this affect habitability ?
How could that be ?
I like to see it as a sneezing shield on the planet .
The effect is that the Earth could have been protected for billions of years , by the magnetic field .
The atmosphere couldn &apos;t escape .
Mars , on the other hand , has not been protected in the absence of a magnetic field , and in billions of years , has been brought away enough atmosphere to go from the habitable planet to the planet we see today .
Other scientists think that magnetic fields act more like a ship sail , allowing the planet to interact with more energy with solar wind than they can interact with themselves .
The sails collect energy from the solar wind .
The magnetic field takes energy out of the solar wind that favors the escape of the atmosphere even more .
It &apos;s an idea that needs to be tested , but the effect and how it works apparently .
That &apos;s because we know that solar power is deposited in the atmosphere here on Earth .
If you &apos;ve never seen them , they &apos;re beautiful .
We know that energy comes in .
We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles come out , and if the magnetic field is influencing somehow .
I &apos;ve given you a problem , but I don &apos;t have the solution yet .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
It &apos;s designed to measure the escape of the atmosphere .
We have similar measurements from Venus and the Earth .
Once we get that answer , why should we care ?
It &apos;s also financially , but profoundly .
It will tell us about atmospheres surrounding us and that are close .
For example , the Kepler spacecraft , built and controlled here in Boulder , looks at an area of the sky the size of a postage stamp , for a couple of years , and found thousands of planets — in a part of the sky of the size of a postage stamp that we don &apos;t think is very different from anywhere else in the sky .
In 20 years , we &apos;ve gone from knowing nothing about planets outside of the solar system , to having so many hours , so we don &apos;t know what to analyze first .
Whatever it &apos;s going to help .
In fact , based on observations taken by Kepler and other similar observations , we now believe , that of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way alone , on average , every star has at least one planet .
In addition to that , estimates suggest that there are 40 to 100 billion of these planets that we would call habitable in one galaxy .
We have observations of these planets , but we don &apos;t yet know what habitables are .
It &apos;s a little bit like being trapped on a red spot — ( Laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately want to know more about it , want to ask them and find out if even a couple of them are a little bit like you .
You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there yet .
So you have to use the tools that are developed for Venus , Earth and Mars , and you have to apply to other situations , and hope to make reasonable inferences from the data , and that you will be able to determine the best candidates on the habitable planet , and which are not .
Eventually , and at least for now , this is our red spot , right here .
It &apos;s the only planet that we know is habitable , even though very soon we might know more about it .
But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
I &apos;m happy we &apos;re here .
Thank you .

I love the Internet .
Really .
Think about everything that brought us .
Think about all the services that we use , all connectivity , all entertainment , all business , business .
And this is happening now .
I &apos;m almost sure one day we &apos;re going to write history books in hundreds of years — this time our generation will be remembered as the generation that went online , the generation that built something truly global .
But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , security problems and privacy problems .
I spent my career fighting these issues .
Let me show you something .
This is Brain .
This is a floppy disk — five inches and a quarter infected with Brain.A .
It &apos;s the first virus that &apos;s ever been found for PC .
And now we know where Brain comes from .
We know this because it &apos;s indicated inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
This is the Boot sector of an infected floppy . If we look closer , we see it right here , he says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the underground . &quot; &quot; And then he goes on , he says , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
And Basit and Amjad are their names , their own Pachistani names .
In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and a address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
Today we are in 2011 .
It &apos;s been 25 years .
The problem with the PC virus is 25 years old .
So six months ago , I decided to go to Pakistan .
Let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of pictures I took while I was in Pakistan .
This is from Lahore &apos;s city , which is about 300 miles south of Abbottabad where Bin Laden was captured .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the way or the way to this building , which is at 730 by Nizam block in Allama Iqbal .
And I knocked on the door .
( Laughter ) Can you guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they &apos;re still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So up here is Basit .
Sitting his brother Amjad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Of course , we had a very interesting conversation .
I asked them why .
I asked them what they felt when they started .
And I was quite pleased to know that Basit and Amjad &apos;s computers were infected dozens of times by other viruses without any connection between them over the course of these years .
So after all , there &apos;s some kind of justice in this world .
The viruses that we used to see in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , of course , are no longer a problem .
Let me show you a couple of examples of what they looked like .
What I &apos;m writing is a system that allows me to run old programs on a modern computer .
Let me load some drive . Go there .
What you see here is a list of old viruses .
Now I &apos;m going to do some viruses on my computer .
For example , first let &apos;s go to the Million virus .
And you see on the top of the screen , there &apos;s a millifoot running down the screen when you get infected with this virus .
You know you &apos;ve been infected , because , in fact , the virus shows up .
Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one that makes sounds .
( Syney noises ) And the last example , guess what the Marcier virus does .
Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking on the screen once you &apos;ve been infected .
So it was pretty easy to know that you were infected with a virus , when viruses were written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , they &apos;re no longer written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What you see here in the background is an example of the operating systems in our workers , where we detect virus infections all over the world .
So we can see in real time that we &apos;ve blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if I connect to our system in the Web lab , you can see in real time , have an idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every day .
This is the last virus we found on a file called Server.ex.
And we found it right here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
And if we go down , there &apos;s a huge amount of it .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And this is the last 20 minutes of malware , every single day .
So where do all these viruses come from ?
Today it &apos;s organized crime bands that write these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
These are bands like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
This is a website that works in Moscow where these people buy infected computers .
So if you &apos;re a virus programmer and you &apos;re able to infect computers based on Windows , but you don &apos;t know what to do with it , you can sell these infectious computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these people .
And they &apos;re actually going to pay you for these computers .
So how do these people monetize these infected computers ?
There are several ways , like trojan bankers , stealing money from your online account when you do online transactions , or key loggers .
The Key loggers are shut down in your computer , hidden , and they record everything you type .
So you &apos;re there on the computer and you &apos;re doing Google research .
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to criminals .
Every single email you write is saved and sent to criminals .
Same thing with every single password and so on .
But the things that are most searched for are the sessions that you go online and buy online shops .
Because when you shop in online stores , you put your name in , the delivery address , the number of credit card and the safety code of paper .
And here &apos;s an example of a file that we found on a server a couple of weeks ago .
This is the number of credit card , this is the deadline date , this is the safety code , and this is the name of the paper title .
Once you have access to people &apos;s credit card data , you can go online and buy what you want with this information .
And that , of course , is a problem .
We now have a whole underground market and a commercial ecosystem built around online crime .
One example of how these people actually are able to monetize their operations . Let &apos;s take a look at the pages of the INTERPOL and go to the searched people .
We find people like Bjorn Sundin , Sweden , and his birthday , also put him in the lists of the INTERPOL , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , an American citizen .
These people ran an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they collected millions .
Now I &apos;m both in escape .
Nobody knows where they are .
American officials , just a couple of weeks ago , frozen an Swiss bank account that belongs to Mr. Jain , and that current account had 14.9 million dollars .
So the amount of money that creates cybercrime is relevant .
And that means that cybercriminals can afford to invest in their attacks .
We know that cybercriminals hire programmers , they hire people to test , test their codes , having SQL database systems .
And they can afford to see how we work — how we work with security — and try to circumvent the security barriers that we build .
They also use the global nature of the Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
And if you look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video made by Clarifie Networks , which explains how a single malware family is able to move around the world .
This operation , you believe it &apos;s originally from Estonia , moving from one country to another , as soon as the site tries to get rid of it .
So you can &apos;t just turn them off .
They &apos;re going to go from one country to another , from a jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , exploiting the fact that we don &apos;t have the ability to globally overlook operations like this .
So the Internet — it &apos;s as if someone had given free airline tickets to all the cybercriminals in the world .
The criminals who had never been able to reach us now can do that .
So how do you find these online criminals ?
How do you get them together ?
Let me give you an example .
What you see here is an exploit file .
Here I &apos;m looking at a hexdump of a picture file , which contains an exploit .
Basically , if you try to see this image file on your computer , it actually takes control of your PC and activates the code .
Now , if you look at this image file — there &apos;s the intestation of the image , and here &apos;s the real code that starts the attack .
This code was encrypted , so we repeat it .
It was encrypted with XOR function 97 .
Believe me , that &apos;s it .
And we can go here and start to repeat it .
The yellow part of the code is now deciphered .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t look very different from the original .
But keep looking .
You &apos;ll see down here , you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / ioo.ex. And when you visualize this image on your computer , you download a program and you start it .
And this is the backdoor that takes ownership of your computer .
But more interestingly , if we keep decoding , we find this mysterious string that says O600KO78RUS .
That code is there encrypted as a kind of signature .
It doesn &apos;t need anything .
And I looked at it , trying to figure out what that meant .
So obviously I Googlata .
No outcome ; there was no .
So I talked to the kids in the lab .
And we have a couple of Russians in our labs , and one of them thought , well , it ends up in ruses like Russia .
And 78 is the postal code of the city of San Petersburg .
For example , you find it in some phone numbers , in tags and things like that .
So I went to search in the San Petersburg rubris , and after a long way , we found this particular website .
There &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been working online for several years that manages his own website , and he runs a blog in the most popular Diary Live .
And on his blog , he tells about his life , about his life in St. Peteroburg — it &apos;s a little more than twentysomethings — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a beautiful machine .
In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 liters of cylinder with more than 400 horses .
It &apos;s a beautiful car for a 20-year-old boy in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about this machine ?
Because he told the machine on the blog .
He had an accident .
In the middle of St. Petersburgh , he put another car in .
And he put on the blogs images of the crash — this is his Mercedes — this is the Lada Samara that he tagged .
And you can see that the Samara plate ends with 78RUS .
And if you look at the picture of the scene , you can see that the Mercedes plate is O600KO78RUS .
I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I were , at this point I would say , &quot; &quot; The case is closed . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when cybercriminals are caught ?
In many cases , you never get that far .
In most online crimes , we don &apos;t even know what continent attacks come from .
And even if we were able to find cybercriminals , very often you don &apos;t get to any outcome .
Local police don &apos;t intervene , or if they do , there &apos;s no evidence for that , or for some reason you can &apos;t arrest .
I wish it was easier ; unfortunately it &apos;s not .
But things are changing at a very fast rate .
You &apos;ve all heard about Stuxnet .
If you look at what Stuxnet did , he infected these .
This is a Siemens S7-400 PLC , a programmable logical computer .
And that makes our infrastructure go .
That &apos;s what makes everything going around us .
The PLC , these little un-screen boxes , without keyboards , which are programmed , are put there , and they do their work .
For example , the elevators of this building are probably controlled by one of these .
And when Stuxnet infects one , it &apos;s a mass revolution about the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
Because around us everything is managed by these things .
I mean , we have vital infrastructure .
You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food production plant , look around — everything is run by computers .
Everything is run by computers .
Everything depends on the work of these computers .
We &apos;ve become very dependent on the Internet , from basic things like electricity , of course , from the work of computers .
And this is something that creates new problems to us .
We need to find a way to keep working even though computers should get less .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) To be prepared means that we can do things even when the tools we take for granted are not there .
It &apos;s really basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about reserve solutions , thinking about things that are really important .
I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . It &apos;s true .
Think about all the services we have online .
Imagine if they took them away , if you didn &apos;t have them for one day or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried because we might not see this .
I &apos;m worried because we &apos;re facing problems because of cybercrime .
Cyber crime is the only thing that could take us away these things .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent a lifetime defending the network , and I feel that if we don &apos;t fight cybercrime , we run the risk of losing everything .
We have to do it globally , and we have to do it now .
What we need is more global , a job to apply international law to find the bands of cybercriminals — these organized groups that are doing millions of their attacks .
It &apos;s much more important than activating anti-virus or firewall .
What &apos;s really important is finding the people behind these attacks , and more importantly , we have to find the people who are going to join this world of online crime , but they haven &apos;t done it yet .
We need to find people with skills , but without opportunities and give them the opportunity to use their skills for the best .
Thank you very much .

The world is changing at a remarkable speed .
If you look at the graph up here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
If you look at the graph for 2050 , projections say that the Chinese economy is going to be twice as much as the American economy , and that Indian economy will be almost like the American economy .
We should keep in mind that these projections were made before the Western financial crisis .
A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the most updated projections of the BNP Paribas than China was going to have a bigger ecomony than the United States .
The Goldman Sachs estimated for 2027 .
The post-crisis projections are for 2020 .
It &apos;s just a decade .
China will change the world on two fundamental aspects .
First of all , China is a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has gone up for more than 30 years than about 10 percent a year .
Over a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
During the modern age , it never happened that the largest economy in the world was a developing country , rather than a developed country .
Secondly , for the first time in the modern age , the dominant country in the world — what I think China will become — is not going to be a Western country and with very different cultural roots , but very different .
I &apos;m aware that there is a certain belief in the West that as countries modernize , at the same time Western .
It &apos;s an illusion .
That modernity is just a product of competition , market and technology , it &apos;s a assumption .
It &apos;s not ; because it &apos;s influenced in the same way by history and culture .
China is not like the West and it &apos;s not going to be like the West .
It will remain , in its most fundamental , very different aspects .
The big question here becomes obvious ; how do we make sense of China ?
How do you figure out what China is ?
The problem that we have today in the West , at the very top , is the conventional approach that sees everything through a Western mindset , through Western ideas .
We can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;d like to propose , now , three basic elements to understand what China is — so to start .
The first is , China is not a real country and a nation-state .
Okay , it &apos;s been called this in the last hundred years , and yet , anyone who knows something about China knows it &apos;s much older than that .
This is what China looks like with the winning of the Qin dynasty in 221 A.D. , at the end of the wars — the birth of modern China .
You can compare it to the boundaries of modern China .
Or with the next Han dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
You can see how I &apos;ve already done most of the known territories such as East China , where most Chinese lived and where they live today .
The most amazing thing about this is that what gives China its sense , what Chinese people the sense of being Chinese has not flown away from the last hundred years or so from the time of the nation-state , what has happened in the West , but from the time , if we want to put it this way , the nation-civilization .
I &apos;m thinking , for example , about uses like ancestral adoration , to a very peculiar state conception , and in the same way , to a family conception as distinctive to social relationships like &quot; &quot; guanxi , &quot; &quot; to the values of Confucianity and so on .
All of these things originated during the time of the state-civilization .
China , unlike Western states and most of the United States in the world , is shaped by its own sense of civilization , its existence as a nation-civilization , rather than a nation-state .
There &apos;s another thing to add to you , and that &apos;s this : We certainly know that China is large and immense , both demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we &apos;re often not very aware of is that China is extremely different and very pluralistic , and for many very decentralized aspects .
You can &apos;t control a place of such a scale simply by Beijing , even if we think that way .
It &apos;s never been that way .
So this is China , a state-civilization , rather than a nation-state .
What does that mean ?
I think it has a lot of profound implications .
Let me give you two examples .
The first is that the most important political value for Chinese is the unity , is the preservation of Chinese civilization .
We all know this as it did 2,000 years ago in Europe : collapse , the Scotton of the Roman Empire Sacre .
He divided , and he stayed that way since then .
China , over the same period of time , has driven exactly in the opposite direction , trying painful to keep this huge civilization together , this state-civilization .
The second is perhaps more prosaic and it &apos;s Hong Kong .
Do you remember Hong Kong &apos;s return to China from Britain in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposal was .
One state , two systems .
I could bet that few in the West believed us .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s just a specter for the allodae .
When China will put their hands on Hong Kong , it will not be . &quot; &quot; After 13 years , Hong Kong &apos;s political and legal systems are as different as they were in 1997 .
We were wrong . But why ?
We were wrong because we thought , of course , in terms of nation-states .
Think about the unification of Germany in 1990 .
What happened ?
Basically , the Eastern was jammed by the West .
A country , a system .
This is the nation-state mindset .
But you can &apos;t govern a country like China , a state-civilization , the conception of a civilization , a system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
So China &apos;s reaction to the Hong Kong question — as is it going to be for the Taiwan question — was completely natural : a civilization , several systems .
Let me give you another basic element to try to understand China — maybe one not very reassuring .
Chinese have a very , very different concept of race , but very different from most other countries .
You know , 1.3 billion Chinese believe that they belong to the same race , the Hans .
This fact is completely different from most of the world &apos;s most populated countries .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all these countries are multiracious .
Chinese don &apos;t feel that way .
China is just multirky , just marginally .
And the question is , how come ?
I think the question is again to search for the state-civilization .
A story of at least 2,000 years , a story of achievement , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process in which , over time , this conception of Han emerged — of course , fed by increasing and powerful cultural identity .
Now the great advantage of this historic experience was that without the Hans , China could never be together .
Han &apos;s identity was the concrete that kept this country together .
The big disadvantage is that the Hans have a very limited conception of cultural differences .
They really believe in their superiority , and they are irrespectful to those who are not .
From here their attitude , for example , to Uyghurs or Tibetans .
Or let me give you the third base block , the Chinese state .
The relationship between the state and the Chinese society is very different from the Western society .
We in the West for most of us seem to think — at least in the last few days — that the authorities and legitimacy of the state is as a function of Democracy .
The problem with this proportion is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authorities between Chinese than what happens in any Western country .
And the reason is that — actually , there are two reasons , I think .
And of course , it has nothing to do with democracy , because according to our criteria , the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
And the reason is that , first of all , because the Chinese state has a very particular meaning as representative , as a body and a guard of Chinese civilization , of nation-civilization .
This is the level at which China comes to a almost spiritual role .
And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , state power is constantly challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against church , against other sectors of artistocracy , against commercials and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has never been tested .
He never had any rivals .
So you can see that the way power in China has been built is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , however , is that Chinese have a different view of the state .
Where we tend to see it as an intrusion , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers are limited or defined or forced , the Chinese don &apos;t see at all the state like this .
Chinese see the state as a narrow person — actually not just as a narrow person , as a family member — not just as a family member , but as the chief family , the patriarch of the family .
This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different from ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society in a different way than what happens in the West .
And I &apos;d like to suggest to you that what we &apos;re dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a kind of new paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve thought about in the past .
You have to know that China believes in the market and the state .
I mean , Adam Smith , who was already writing at the end of the 18th century , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is bigger and more sophisticated than any other in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , except in Mao &apos;s time , it &apos;s been more or less since then .
But it combines with an extremely strong and pervasive state .
In China , the state is everywhere .
I mean , it controls companies , many are still in public hands .
private companies , even big companies , like Lenovo , depend in many ways from the state &apos;s patronym .
The economic goals and so on are obsessed with the state .
And the state , of course , has lost many other areas — we &apos;re familiar with — with something like one-child policy .
Not only that , it &apos;s a very ancient statistic tradition , a very old tradition of state conception .
I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is an example of this .
But this is another one , this is the Great Canal , which was first built in the fifth century A.D.
And it was finally completed in the seventh century .
It runs for 1,794 kilometers , connecting Beijing with Hangzhou with Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of state infrastructure projects in China , which I suppose helps explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Diga and many other expressions of state tasks in China .
So here we have three basic blocks to try to figure out how different China is — the state-civilization , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship with society .
And we still insisted , in a maximum way , to think that we can understand China simply based on Western experience , looking with Western eyes , using Western conceived ideas .
If you want to know why we infallibly interpret China in the wrong way — our predictions of what &apos;s going to happen in China are not right — that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I have to say , I think the attitude to China is to have a little Western mindset .
It &apos;s almost arrogant .
It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think we &apos;re better , and so we have the universal measure .
And secondly , it &apos;s from ignorant .
We refuse to address the problem of difference .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen argues that Western thinking is probably the most cosmopolitical of all cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant around the world that it &apos;s not really necessary to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because , ultimately , it could , if necessary , get everything with force .
Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact — that has been in a much weak position , compared to the West , has been forced to understand the West , because of the presence of the West in these societies .
And therefore , they are more cosmopolitan than the West in many ways .
I mean , take the question of the Far East .
Ear East : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
It &apos;s now the largest economic region in the world .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , the people of the far East , are much more prepared for the West than the West is about the far East .
I &apos;m afraid this point is particularly appropriate today .
Why is this happening ? Going back to the chart at the beginning — the Goldman Sachs graph .
What happens is that , very quickly in historical terms , the world is driven and formed , not by the historical developed countries , but by developing countries .
We &apos;ve seen that in terms of G20 — which are rapidly scaling G7 , or G8 .
And there are two consequences .
First , the West is rapidly losing its influence on the world .
There was a striking illustration of this situation a year ago — Copenhagen , the conference on climate change .
Europe was not at the final negotiation table .
What happened the last time ?
I think it was about 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
And the second implication is that the world inevitably , as a consequence , becomes less and less familiar , because it will be based on cultures and experiences and stories that aren &apos;t familiar with , or that we &apos;re not practical about .
And finally , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe , America is slightly different — but the Europeans have to say , they &apos;re largely ignorant , they &apos;re unaware of the way the world is changing .
Some people — I have an English friend in China , and he says , &quot; &quot; The continent is a sonnambula , lives in a limb . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s true , maybe it &apos;s exaggeration .
But there &apos;s another problem that goes from equal — that Europe is less and less in touch with the world — and it &apos;s kind of a loss of the sense of the future .
I mean , Europe once , of course , was driving the future based on trust .
Take the 19th century for example .
But this , unfortunately , is no longer true .
If you want to hear the future , if you want to feel the future , try China — there &apos;s the old Confucius .
This is a railroad station like you &apos;ve never seen .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railroad station .
This is the new station in Guangzhou for high-speed trains .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world , and soon it will have a bigger network than the rest of the world put together .
Or take this one : This is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to quickly try in a Beijing suburb .
Here &apos;s a giant bus , on the upper floor , takes about 2,000 people .
It travels around a suburban road , and cars travel below .
And it travels at the speed of about 160 miles an hour .
That &apos;s how things are going to move , because China has a specific problem , which is different from that European and different from the United States , and China has a very large , very small population .
So this is a solution to a situation where China will have many , many , many cities that exceeds 20 million people .
Okay , how would I end ?
Well , what should our attitude to the world that we see rapidly develop in front of us ?
I think there will be good things and bad things .
But I claim , first of all , a good picture for the world .
For 200 years , the world has essentially been governed by a small part of the human population .
This is what Europe and North America represented .
The arrival of countries like China and India — 38 percent of the world &apos;s population in two — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important part of a single act of democracy in the last 200 years .
Civilizations and cultures , who have been ignored , without a voice , that we haven &apos;t heard , who weren &apos;t known , will have a different destiny in representing the world .
As Umans , we have to welcome , of course , to this transformation , and we have to learn something about civilization .
This great ship is the one that has jumped from Zheng He in the early 15th century for its great journey around the south of China , the seas of the east of China and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
The little boat in front of it was the one that , 80 years later , Cristopho Colombo crossed the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Or , look carefully on this parchment made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Oh my God , the Chinese invented golf .
Let &apos;s welcome the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to make the revolution .
But before I run to guns , or sing together , or choose my favorite color , I want to give you my definition of revolution .
To me , revolution is a radical and lungical shift in the way we think and how we behave — the way we think and how we behave .
You might ask , why , Steve , does it take a revolution ?
You need a revolution because things are not working ; it &apos;s just for that .
And that makes me really sad , because I &apos;m amazed to see things that don &apos;t work .
You know , I &apos;m amazed to see how we don &apos;t leverage our potential .
We &apos;re getting to the last .
And we &apos;re at the last place in so many things — for example , in social factors .
Last in Europe for innovation .
There we are , at the bottom of the list , a culture that has not been created to innovation .
Last in public health , that if it worked , we would all be more quiet .
There we are , not just in the United States , but in the last few in Europe , right at the bottom of the ladder .
And what &apos;s even worse , a three-week news , you &apos;ve certainly seen another read , published by The Economist .
We are the saddest place on the planet about the domestic GDP per capita — the saddest place on earth .
This is social , and now we go to education .
Where were we three weeks ago in another OECD report ?
Last in reading , math and science , last .
Commerce : The lowest perception in the United States .
that entrepreneurs take advantage of society .
And what is the consequence ?
The lowest percentage of new businesses .
This is not despite the fact that we all know that small businesses are the engine of the economy .
We employ more than all , we impose more taxes than everyone .
But what if you break the engine ?
The lowest GDP in Europe .
Last .
So let &apos;s not wonder if 62 percent of the Bulgarians lack optimism for the future .
We &apos;re not happy , we have a bad education system , the worst commercial enterprise .
And these are facts , people .
They &apos;re not fabulous that I want to offer you .
They &apos;re not .
And I &apos;m not even racing against the Bulgaria . These are facts .
I think it should be absolutely clear that our system is in the air .
Our way of thinking , of behaving , our behavior operating system doesn &apos;t work .
It takes a radical change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria into a better country , better for us , for our friends , for our families and for our future .
How could that happen ?
But now we think positive . We &apos;re going to change the way we think . How did that happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and it &apos;s going to sound like a drastic statement to some of you — because we &apos;re doing bad for ourselves .
Let &apos;s go back because we don &apos;t value play .
I just said play .
If anyone had forgotten what I &apos;m talking about , that &apos;s what play is .
Babies play , kids play , adults play .
But we don &apos;t value play .
We actually disclose it .
And we do it in three fields .
Let &apos;s take a look .
Social debt : 45 years of what ?
Communism — society and state are more important than the individual , and inadvertently they &apos;ve been trampled creativity , individual expression and innovation .
And what do we matter to ?
Because it &apos;s shown that the way we apply , we create and use knowledge is influenced by the social and institutional context , what was being told in communism ?
You &apos;re serious .
We need to act in a serious way .
It was like this .
( Applause ) Being serious .
I don &apos;t know how many times I was filmed in public gardens because I allowed my kids to play on the ground .
For charity , they play on the ground , or even worse in kal , in the water , and the germs will kill them .
The baboons and the dyado , the grandmothers and grandparents , told me that we shouldn &apos;t have kids play so much , because life is serious , and we have to prepare them appropriately to face life .
We &apos;re dealing with a very troubling meme .
We are threatened by social meme .
A difficult meme to fight .
It &apos;s already 45 years that we live with what I call the grandmother factor . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s how it works .
Punto 1 : The woman says , &quot; &quot; I want a child . Iskam bebe . &quot; &quot; Punto 2 : Here comes the baby , evaporate !
But then what happens at point three ?
I want to go back to work , you want to be a career , you want to socialize .
I &apos;m going to have to rely bebko , the baby , the grandmother .
But we don &apos;t have to forget that it &apos;s 45 years that the grandmother was infected with the meme .
So what happens ?
It transmits the virus to the baby , and then it takes an extremely long time — a Redwood time — because that meme is excreted from our operating system .
And then what happens ?
She goes to school where she persists an antiquate system , immunized in the last hundred years , which demands mechanical learning , memory and standardization , while she doesn &apos;t realize individual expression , self-exploration , questions , creativity , games .
A failed system .
My story : I was looking for a school for my son .
We went to this little prestigious school where they told me that mathematics was taught 10 times a week and science eight times , and reading five times a day and so on .
And we say , &quot; &quot; And when is the interval , when do they play ? &quot; &quot; And they go , &quot; &quot; Ah , but it &apos;s not predicted . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we go , &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s only five years old . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a horrible mismatch .
It &apos;s a misconception that our education system is so serious because education is serious , and that we create brain robots that put bullons into predisposed holes .
I &apos;m sorry , but today &apos;s problems are not the ones of the time of the Industrial Revolution .
We need adaptability , we need to learn to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need automatic workers .
But no , now the meme spreads into the workplace where play is banned .
We create autonomy that we catalog as being corporate goods , that we can use and then dispose them .
How do we think it should be the organization of work ?
Autocratic — that &apos;s what I say because I &apos;m the leader .
I &apos;m the leader , and I know more about you .
It doesn &apos;t trust — because you &apos;re certainly a criminal , I have to use cameras .
( Laughter ) I have to check — of course you &apos;re an idiot , so I &apos;m going to create a billion small procedures for you so you won &apos;t make mistakes .
Part of the limits — don &apos;t use your phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t go on the Internet , don &apos;t use chat .
All of this doesn &apos;t seem professional and it &apos;s negative .
After all , it &apos;s an improductive system , because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re limited , you &apos;re not appreciated and you &apos;re not even fun .
Social , education and working activities , we don &apos;t really matter to work .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t like play .
You say , &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s ridiculous , Steve , that strange ideas .
It can &apos;t be because of the game .
Just for play , it &apos;s a dumb thing . &quot; &quot; The meme is inside us .
Well , I &apos;ll tell you you &apos;re wrong .
Now I &apos;m going to show you how play is the catalyst , the revolutionary element that we can use to transform Bulgaria .
Play : our brain is made for play .
Evolution has favored in millions , billions of years , the attitude to play in animals and men .
And you know ?
Evolution is also very good at erasing traits that don &apos;t present advantages to us and privileging those that benefit us more .
Nature is not stupid , and he chose play .
So let &apos;s look at the animal kingdom : ants also play .
Maybe you didn &apos;t know .
But when they play , they learn social order and dynamics of things .
Rats play , but maybe what you didn &apos;t know is that rats that play larger brains have bigger brains and learn their homework and develop other skills .
Mics play , we all know .
But you may not know that if the private ones in the game are not going to be able to interact socially .
They can still hunt , but they &apos;re not social .
The bears play .
But maybe you don &apos;t know that bears that play more are longer .
The longest ones are not the ones that catch more fish .
They &apos;re the ones that play the most .
Finally , an interesting study showed a correlation between play and size of the brain .
The more you play , the more the brain gets bigger .
The dolphins , remarkable brains , play a lot .
But who do you think you &apos;re playing more with the larger brain ?
But humans !
Children play , we play — they belong to any nationality , race , color , religion .
It &apos;s a universal fact — we play .
And not just the children , but also the adults .
Now a new vocabulary : neotenia — the permanent of play and the younger aspects of adults .
Who shows more neotenia ?
Humans . We play sports .
We do it for fun , or for Olympics , or competition .
We play musical instruments .
We dance , we kiss , we sing , we sketch .
Nature has made us adapted to play from birth to old age .
We &apos;re made to do it all the time — play and play a lot , and never stop .
It &apos;s very good for us .
As animals benefit , they also benefit from humans .
For example , it turns out that it stimulates neural growth in the amygdala , the area that controls emotion .
It enhances prefrontal cortex development , areas that are required for cognitive processes .
And what &apos;s the result ?
That we develop more emotional maturities if we play more .
We will increase the ability to decide whether we play more .
Ladies , these are facts .
These are not stories , narratives , I &apos;m not trying to convince you ; they &apos;re purely scientific data .
These are the benefits that we take from play .
It &apos;s an acquired genetic right , like walking or talking or seeing .
And if we deny the possibility of playing , it &apos;s as if we denied one of the other genetic rights that we give birth to .
We want to stay back .
Let &apos;s do a little exercise together : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
Without theatrics , without the arts , without singing , without dance , no soccer , no football , no laughter .
What does it look like ?
It &apos;s a little depressing .
Malinconic .
Now think about your workplace .
Is it fun ? Is it inspiring ?
Or maybe your friends &apos; friends — we sort of scare the boundaries a little bit .
Is it gaio ? Is it playful ?
Or is it a crap ? Autocratic , that controls , limited , that doesn &apos;t trust and doesn &apos;t satisfy ?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
We even feel guilty when they see us play at work .
&quot; Oh , if my colleagues see me laughing , they think he has nothing to do , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; I have to hide otherwise the boss sees me .
It &apos;s going to think I don &apos;t work hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is obsolete .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play .
It &apos;s depression , depression .
In fact , play improves our work .
Just as there are benefits to men and animals , there are benefits if you play work .
For example , it stimulates creativity .
It increases our availability to change .
Our ability to learn .
It gives us a sense of purpose and professionalism — two important motivation factors that increase productivity , through play .
So if you think that play is not a serious thing , playing isn &apos;t about being frivolous .
You know , the professional athlete who loves ski , does it seriously , but loves it .
He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in his environment , doing what he likes .
Even though doctors are serious , we know that laughter is a very good medicine .
Our thinking is overcome .
But we shouldn &apos;t feel guilty about it .
We should celebrate the game .
A quick example from the corporate world .
FedEx , their motto is people , service , profit .
If you treat people like this , if you make them feel important , they will feel better , happy , motivated and with a sense of control of things .
What happens ? They provide a better service — not worse , better .
And when customers come and deal with happy employees who can make decisions and feel fulfilled , how will customers feel ? Surely good .
And what are clients going to do about service ?
They &apos;re going to ask you more services and talk to their friends , which leads to greater profit .
People , service , profit .
Play increases productivity , not the opposite .
You might say , &quot; &quot; Hey , this works for FedEx in the United States , it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
It doesn &apos;t talk about it . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; But I tell you it works in Bulgaria , for two reasons .
The first is that play is universal .
There &apos;s nothing that keeps the Bulgarians from playing , apart from the bad meme that we have to get rid of .
Secondly , I experienced this at the Sciant .
When I started , customers satisfied zero .
No client would have talked about us well .
I asked everybody .
Our profits were marginal .
We were driving very little , and our partners were dissatisfied .
With a few simple changes , how to increase transparency , facilitate self-determination and collaboration , encouraging collaboration and not autocracy , and to aim for outcomes .
I don &apos;t want to know when you get to the office or when you leave .
I &apos;m interested in how teams and clients are happy , and do everything as a function of this .
Why should I care if you attach to 9 ?
We put the accent on fun .
And we created a fantastic atmosphere that allowed us to transform Sciant within three short years — it looks like a long time , but it takes a while to change — and all the customers started talking about us , we had high profits on average and happy partners .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how do you know if they &apos;re really happy ? &quot; &quot; Well , every time we participated in the course of the best employer we &apos;ve always won .
It &apos;s based on the data from anonymous survey survey independently .
So in Bulgaria , the system works .
There &apos;s nothing that can hold us , except our preconceptions about play .
To conclude , what we need to do to change things through play .
First of all , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , well , go home and think about it or think about it .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t feel the sense of play inside of you , then you have to rediscover it .
Whatever you like as a child , or only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve had your promotion , you can &apos;t get away from it anymore , because you believe you have to be serious people , rediscover it !
I know , going to mountain bike or reading a book or playing a game .
Find it . Because it depends on innovation , the change in the way you think .
It &apos;s up to you to go back to your offices or talk to your friends and make the fire of change in the game revolution .
It &apos;s you who have to do it , because if you don &apos;t hear it , they won &apos;t even feel your colleagues and your employees .
You have to go to them and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , you have all my confidence . &quot; &quot; Strange concept . I hired you , and so I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions , you &apos;re going to make it to your disproportion , and I want to delegate to my subordinates , not to my colleagues and high school .
I &apos;m going to pick up the constructive critics .
I &apos;m going to let you question the decisions of leaders .
Because it &apos;s really rethinking what we &apos;ve always taken for granted that we can break down the barriers of consumerism and create innovative solutions for today &apos;s problems .
Being a leader doesn &apos;t mean being right all the time .
We &apos;re going to have to eradicate fear .
It &apos;s fear of the enemy of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminating limitations .
You know what , let me use the mobile phone for personal calls — charity .
Let them go to the Internet .
Let them chatter .
They take longer lunch breaks .
lunch break takes to get off the work .
It &apos;s when you go to each other and recover the brain , meet friends , you get a beer , something to eat , and you talk , that you &apos;re born with the ideas that maybe you didn &apos;t come to mind before .
Leave them do . Give them a little bit of freedom , and generally let them play . Make the workplace fun .
We spend so much time at work , and if we let our lives get paid out of it , what are we going to say here at 20 years , &quot; &quot; Everything here ?
There was nothing more than that ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemyv .
( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a big change in the way we act and think , but we don &apos;t need the workers revolution .
We don &apos;t need the workers revolution .
What we need are juggling caves , which are many of us to decide to play . A lot of players .
Really , we need to be together . We can start today . What we need to do is we need to feed the fire of the revolution . You have to share your ideas and your success stories .
about what worked and invigorated our lives , our schools and our work through play ; how play promotes a sense of promise and agency ; how it promotes innovation and productivity ; and ultimately how play gives meaning to things .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together . And together , sharing these ideas about play , we &apos;re going to transform Bulgaria into a better country .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start by proposing a strategy and all it requires is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
But before I give it to you , I want to ask you to do , now , a little control of your body and what you do with your body .
How many of you somehow get smaller ?
Sometimes we cross our arms like this .
Sometimes we open up . ( Laughter ) I can see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re really fascinated by the language of the body , and we &apos;re particularly interested in the language of the body .
You know , we &apos;re intrigued by — ( Laughter ) — an interaction that &apos;s frozen , or a smile , or a smiling smile , or maybe an ambulance smile , or maybe something like a handshake .
Narrator : This is where they get to number 10 and look .
The BBC and The New York Times , too .
So of course , when we think about non-verbal behavior , or body language — but we social scientists call it non-verbal — it &apos;s a language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
And there are many reasons to believe that this is a correct one .
We provide sharp judgments and inferences from body language .
And those judgments can predict really meaningful outcomes like who we assume or who we support , who we ask to leave .
For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch a 30-second audio video of actual interactions between patients and physicians , their judgment on the kindness of the doctor predicts whether the doctor is going to be judged or not .
If you use bad , it &apos;s a bad idea . Right ?
We are also influenced by non-verbal language , our thoughts and feelings and our physiology .
What non-verbal language am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice and I teach in a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I was interested in power dynamics .
I &apos;m particularly interested in non-verbal expressions of force and dominance .
And what are the non-verbal expressions of force and dominance ?
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s the relative to expansion .
You make yourself bigger , you expand , you take space , you basically open up .
Let &apos;s talk about openness . And that &apos;s true .
This expression , known as pride , was studied by Jessica Tracy . It shows how .
We make little things . We don &apos;t want to connect with people around us .
And this is what happens when you put them together .
If someone is really strong about us , we tend to make us small . We don &apos;t respect them .
I look at this behavior in the classroom , and what do I know ? I look at MBA students .
When they sit , they expand .
There are other people folding virtually when they enter . As soon as they enter , you see .
I find a couple of things about this .
Women tend to do so much more than men .
Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so it &apos;s not surprising . But the other thing I noticed is that the other thing I noticed is that .
And it &apos;s really important in a MBA class , because participation matters half of the final vote .
Business school compares with this difference in evaluation depending on sex .
I started asking myself — okay , there are these people here .
There &apos;s evidence that this is the case .
So , for example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but even when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happier .
It works in both senses . When it comes to strength .
The second question was — we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of strong , what am I talking about ?
So , what are the minds of the strong ?
It &apos;s not surprising that strong minds tend to be more assertive , safer and more optimistic .
They really feel like they can win even in luck games .
There &apos;s a lot of difference . There &apos;s more risks .
But in fact , force also has to do with stress response .
Do you want a very strong , dominant leader , high testosterone , but very reactive to stress ?
Probably not , right ? You want a person .
We have this proof , that the body can shape the mind , at least at least in the face , and also that the role shift is affecting the mind .
What happens if you hire a role ? What happens if you do it discretly , like this little manipulation , this little intervention ?
Here &apos;s another couple of them .
You can stand up or sit .
And these are the limited force postures .
You fold up , you make yourself small .
When you touch your neck , you touch your neck .
This is what happens . They come in .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
These are the results in terms of testosterone .
Again , in two minutes you get these changes .
Here &apos;s the ringing data . In people with high strength .
It seems that non-verbal language really determines not only others , it &apos;s us too .
Our body changes our mind .
We really think that what matters as a social threat situation . Where do you come from ?
It &apos;s not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s about you talking to yourself . What do you do ?
That &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
Five minutes . They &apos;re recorded .
For five minutes , nothing , and it &apos;s worse than being interrupted .
People hate it . That &apos;s what Marianne LaFrance calls .
We then have these programmers watching video , there are four of them .
I &apos;m in the dark of the hypotheses . I &apos;m in the dark of conditions .
It &apos;s about presence that leads to speech .
These kinds of things . People basically carry things .
This is what drives the effect or the effect .
So I said , you &apos;re fake until you do it . No — it &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like I &apos;m fake .
I don &apos;t want to feel like I &apos;m a preposer .
At 19 , I was involved in a bad car accident .
I was catapulted out of the car , and I rotated several times .
I was catapulted by the car , and I woke up with a skull trauma .
I knew my I.Q. because I had been evaluated as a clever , and I was labeled as a child prodigit .
So I leave university , and I keep trying to get back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to end university .
I &apos;m a preposer .
You &apos;re going to remove and do it this way .
Like , I became this . I &apos;m really doing it . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I did . Five years of graduate school .
I don &apos;t hear it anymore , but she does , and I understand that feeling .
It can pretend , it can become .
It had changed .
So I want to tell you , don &apos;t pretend to do that .
Make it to become . You know ? It &apos;s not .
Do it enough until you become and internalize it .
The last thing I want to leave you with is this .
Climate change can lead to big changes .
So in two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
This is what you want to do . Configurate your brain .
Make the testosterone go up . Make it go down .
Don &apos;t get out of that situation with the feeling that you haven &apos;t shown who you are .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Great creativity . In times of need , you need creativity .
and discussion . Creativity is surprisingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
Great creativity can spread tolerance , sustain freedom , make education seem a brilliant idea .
( Laughter ) The great creativity can put a light on the misery , or show you that your misery is not necessarily that .
Great creativity can make politicians elected , or unelected parties . Great creativity can make politicians elected , or unelected parties .
It can make war look like a tragedy or a flour .
Creativity has sentences to put on our T-shirt and ways to say about our mouths .
It &apos;s the explorer showing us a simple road in the middle of a moral maze impenetrable .
Science is smart , but great creativity is something less knowledge , and more magical . And now we need that magic .
This is a need moment .
Our climate is changing fast , too fast .
And we need great creativity to do what it does so well : to invite us to think differently with creative acts of effect .
We need to engage in different ways with innovative inventives .
Here &apos;s a similar insight , from an initiative where I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
( VIDEO : I &apos;m not going to drive today , I prefer to walk .
Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked , he saw things .
Beautiful , wonderful things that otherwise would not have seen .
A steam with a leg scream , a flying motorcycle .
A father and a daughter who was a mysterious wall separated from a bicycle .
And then he stopped . In front of him was her .
The woman who had run with him for the camps , and had broken his heart .
Of course , she was a little old .
Very , indeed .
But he felt like he was restoring his old passion for her .
&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called it sweetly . It was his name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said . It was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , 300 meters straight from here .
Let &apos;s go . Let &apos;s make love . In a tent . &quot; &quot; Ford turned off . She went off a leg , then the other one .
Gusty walked into her with strength and made love , ritually , as she filmed it , as a passionate pornographer who she was .
Their passion could displace rocks .
Since then , they were happy and happy .
And all because he , that day , chose to walk .
( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We had science , we had a lot of arguments .
The moral imperative is on the table .
We need great creativity to take this and make it simple and clear .
To get it to people , and then to get them to act .
So this is a call , a plea , to that community of incredible talents that is TED .
Be creative about climate change .
And thank you very quickly . Thank you .

Beau Lotto : This game is very simple .
You have to read what you see . Okay ?
I &apos;m going to know for you , so we don &apos;t have to do it all .
One , two , three . Audience : Can you read this ?
BL : That &apos;s great . And this ? One , two , three . Audience : You don &apos;t read this .
BL : Very good . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese . And this ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
BL : &quot; &quot; What are you reading ? &quot; &quot; There are no words there .
I told you to read what you see . Right ?
The letter says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ar ou arrhea ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you had to say . Right ? Why ?
Because perception is rooted in our experience .
The mind takes meaningless information and gives them a sense ; we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only see what was useful to see in the past .
That means that , when it comes to perceptions , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) It leaves information . It generates a behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ah ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : Sometimes , when things don &apos;t go as we want , a little bit annoying , right ?
But this is about perceptions , or isn &apos;t it ?
On perceptions , it fuses everything we think , we know , we believe , hopes , dreams , what we wear , fall in love , all starts with perceptions .
If perceptions are rooted in our history , it means that we only react by what we &apos;ve already done .
But it &apos;s actually a tremendous problem , because how do you see things differently ?
I want to tell you a story about how to see things differently , and how all new perceptions start the same way .
They start with a question .
The problem with questions is that they create uncertainty .
Uncertainty is a bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that that &apos;s a predator there , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seawater is a consequence of uncertainty .
If you go down , the inner ear tells you that you &apos;re moving . The eyes , moving together with the boat , tell me they &apos;re still .
The mind can &apos;t handle the uncertainty of that infomation , and it &apos;s bad .
Ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
And yet , the irony is that the only way we can do something new is to venture into that space .
So how could we ever do something new ? Well luckily , evolution gave us an answer , right ?
And it also allows us to tackle the hardest questions , the best questions are the ones that create more uncertainty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things that we give for real . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how life started , about what &apos;s beyond the universe , but questioning what you &apos;re giving for real is really to venture into that space .
So what is the answer to evolution to the problem of uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
Play is not just a process . Experts will tell you that it &apos;s a way of being .
Play is one of the only human activities where uncertainty is celebrated , and uncertainty is what makes play fun .
It adapts to changes . It opens to possibilities , and cooperation . That &apos;s how we create our social relationships , and it has intrinsic motivation , and that means we play to play . Play is reward for itself .
Now , if we look at these five ways of being , they &apos;re the same ways of being needed to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the material section and methods of an article .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , this , valid for everything creative .
If we add rules as we play , we get a real game .
That &apos;s how experiments work .
Armati of these two ideas , that science is a way of being and that experiments are a game , we wondered , can we all become scientists ?
What if not 25 children from eight to 10 years old ?
They are the experts . So I took my own technology of bees into a small school in Devon , and the goal was not just to get science to kids differently , but , through the scientific process , to see themselves differently . Okay ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , it &apos;s said that there were no funding for this study because scientists said that children couldn &apos;t give a significant contribution to science , and teachers who couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did the same . Of course .
These are some of the questions . I wrote them small so you don &apos;t bother to read them . The point is that five of the questions that children have asked were actually the basis of scientific publishing in the last five to 15 years .
So they asked questions that are significant for experts .
Now I want to share the stage with a very special person .
She was one of the kids involved in the study , and now she &apos;s one of the youngest scientists ever published in the world . Okay ? She &apos;s going to be , once she gets onstage , the youngest person I &apos;ve ever talked to TED .
To do science and ask questions , it takes courage .
She &apos;s the personification of the courage , because she &apos;s going to come here and talk in front of all of you .
Amy , do you want to get up here ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Amy will help me tell you the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees project , and first of all , it will tell you the question they asked . It also starts , Amy .
Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought it was easy to see the connection between man and monkeys in the way of thinking , because we &apos;re similar .
But we wondered if there was a link to other animals , it would be amazing if men and bees thought the same way , because they look so different from us .
So we wondered if men and bees could solve complex problems the same way .
Really , we wanted to find out if bees could also adapt to new situations by harnessing rules and conditions that were previously learned , what if bees thought like us ?
Well , that would be surprising , because we &apos;re talking about an insect with just a million brain cells .
But in fact , it would make a lot of sense , because bees , like us , know a good flower to regardless of the hour , from light , from time , from any angle they approach you . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . Children got to work and designed this experiment , and so — or better , play — and so Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and you saw the puzzle ?
AO : The puzzle that we designed was based on se-then logic .
We asked bees to learn not only to go to a certain color , but to a flower of a certain color only when it responds to a certain pattern .
They only get a reward if they went to yellow flowers , if the yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
So there are a number of different rules that bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , what ?
What was really exciting about this project was that we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
It was totally new , and nobody had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : I got the teachers , and it was very hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to start with no idea what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher , don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — a lot of the merits go to Dave Strudwick , who &apos;s been working on this project .
I won &apos;t go into the details of the study because you can read it , but the next step is observation . Here are some students in the observation , and they &apos;re recording the data about where the bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what do we do ? — Alunno : 5C .
DS : It &apos;s always going up there ? — Man : Yeah .
DS : So let &apos;s look at all . — Alunn : Henry , do you give me a hand ?
BL : &quot; &quot; Give me a hand , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist wouldn &apos;t say that ?
Alunn : There are two up there .
And three down there .
BL : So we have our observations . We have our data .
They do the simple calculations , the medium , etc . , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share it . It &apos;s the next step .
We fix it all and try to propose it for publication , so we have to restore it .
So , of course , let &apos;s go to the pub . Okay ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine . ( Laughter ) And I say , a paper splits into four parts : introduction , materials and methods , results , discussion .
The introduction says , what is the question and why ?
Materials and methods : What did you do ? Researchers : What did you look at ?
And the discussion is , who cares ?
Here &apos;s a scientific article , basically . ( Laughter ) Children give me the words . I make a story of it , so the article is written in the language of children .
I didn &apos;t write it . Amy and his classmates wrote it . As a result , the scientific article begins with , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of the results say , &quot; &quot; The preachers , the mystery — it &apos;s from dice aaaaan . &quot; &quot; Okay ? ( Laughter ) And materials and methods say , &quot; &quot; Then we put bees in a fridge — and we &apos;ve done the pie of bees — ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a scientific thing .
Here &apos;s the first page . Let &apos;s see that there are lots of authors .
Everybody in the fat has been eight to 10 years old .
The first author is the Blackawton Primary School , because if it should ever be mentioned , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al . &quot; &quot; And not a single individual , and then we send it to an open access magazine , and they told us that . They told us so many things , but they told us that .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the article doesn &apos;t satisfy our initial requirements in different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it begins with &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; &quot; in numbers are written in pencil , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask a deal . &quot; &quot; So I sent it to Dale Purves , which is from the National Academy of Sciences , one of the great neuroscientists in the world , &quot; &quot; which has never called the great science . &quot; ( Laughter )
Larry Maloney , a visual perception expert , said , &quot; &quot; The article is great .
The work would be publishable if you were an adult . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sent it back to the editor .
They said no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a comment to frame the results of scientists &apos; eyes , we put in the references and sent it to Biology Letters .
And there it was examined by five independent referees , and it was published . ( Applause ) It took four months for scientific research , two years to publish it . ( Laughter ) Typical of science , actually . This is from Amy and his youngest scientists ever published .
What was the feedback ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times the first day .
It &apos;s among the Science Choice Foreign , among the best scientific journals .
It will always be free on Biology Letters .
It &apos;s the only article that will always be free in this magazine .
Last year it was the second most downloaded article on Biology Letters , with feedback not only from scientists and teachers but also from the public .
I &apos;ll read you one .
&quot; &quot; I read &quot; &quot; Blackawton Bees &quot; &quot; recently . I don &apos;t find the words to explain exactly what I think of it .
What you &apos;ve done is real , real and surprising .
Curiosity , interest , innocence and ze are the most basic and most important things to do science .
Who else can have these qualities if not children ?
Do my compliments to his team of children . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I try it on you ? ( Laughter ) Come on , come on , come on . Come on , come on . Okay .
To do science is to take risks , and this is an incredible risk . ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Okay ? Because we &apos;ve only tried it once so far . ( Laughter ) She loves technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Yeah , but I also love myself .
BL : Here &apos;s the paradigm of technology . Okay .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , okay ?
He has to close his eyes and he has to indicate where my hands are beating . Okay ?
( Clapping ) ( Claps ) How about if everybody on that side scream ? One , two , three .
Audience : ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) All right . Now open your eyes . We do it again .
On that side , shout everybody . ( Screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
We usually spend our lives responding , but if we want to do something different , we need to go into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world with new eyes .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It opens up the possibility to venture into uncertainty through the process of play .
I think the real scientific training should be about giving people voice and allowing them to express that voice , so I asked Amy to be the last voice of this story .
Amy ?
AO : This project was very enthusiastic to me , because it gave birth to the process of discovery , and it showed me that everyone , and I say everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a great discovery .
Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or difficult . Everything depends on how that person is confronted with change .
But changing my view of science was surprisingly easy . After playing and thinking about the puzzle , then I realized that science is not just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
You just have to have an opportunity . My opportunity came into the Beau person , and with the Blackawton Bee project .
Thank you . BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about are the world &apos;s biggest problems .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Sceptical Environment , &quot; &quot; which was published by Bjorn Lomborg , probably would be a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;m going to talk about , what are the biggest problems in the world ?
And I have to say , before I go on , I should ask each of you to take out paper and pen because I &apos;m actually asking you to help me think about how we &apos;re going to do it .
So take paper and pen .
The bottom problem is that there are many problems in the world .
I &apos;m going to mention a few of them .
There are 800 million people dying of starvation .
There &apos;s a billion people without access to drinking water .
Two billion without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
And the list goes on again .
There are two million people who will be hardly affected by climate change — and so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would all solve them , but we don &apos;t .
We actually don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do that , the question I think we have to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why we &apos;re in the economic session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all the things , we really have to start asking ourselves , what are the ones that we should solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had , say , 50 billion dollars to spend in the next four years doing something good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We &apos;ve identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I &apos;ll read you briefly : climate change , transmissible diseases , conflict , education , financial instability , government and corruption , denutriation and hunger , migration of populations , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade walls .
We believe that these in many ways contain the biggest problems in the world .
The obvious question to ask is , what do you think the biggest problems are ?
Where should we start to solve these problems ?
But it &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
It &apos;s actually the problem that was done in Davos in January .
But of course , it &apos;s a problem asking people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
And of course the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve it , right ?
So the point is not to prioritize problems , but to prioritize problems .
And this may be — but of course it becomes a little more complicated .
for climate change that would be like Kyoto .
For contagious diseases , there would be health clinics or bed nets .
For conflict , it would be the U.N. peace forces , etc .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to try to do , it &apos;s only in 30 seconds , and I know that in a way it &apos;s an impossible task — write what you think are probably some of the main priorities .
And also — and it &apos;s of course where the economy gets bad — noticing what the things we shouldn &apos;t do , first .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please take 30 seconds , talk to your neighbor , and determine what the main priorities should be and the bottom line of the solutions that we have to the most severe problems in the world .
The cool part of this process — and of course , I mean , I &apos;d like to — I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you a pretty substantial part of my time , right ?
I &apos;d like to go into detail , and think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we &apos;ve done .
And I &apos;m also frightening to you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll have these arguments later , to hang on , how do we prioritize ?
Of course , you ask yourself , why has never been done before such a list ?
And the reason is that assigning priorities is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do that .
Of course , every organization would like to be on top of a list like this .
But every organization would also hate not to be on top of the list .
And because there are many more &quot; &quot; non-numeriously &quot; &quot; points on the list than numbers one , it &apos;s perfectly sensible not to want to make a list like this .
We have the United Nations for almost 60 years , and we haven &apos;t actually done a fundamental list of all those great things that we can do in the world , and said , what of those should we do before ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not prioritizing — each decision is to assign a priority , so obviously we &apos;re still assigning it even though it &apos;s implicitly — and it &apos;s unlikely that it &apos;s just as functional that if we actually had a priority assignment , and we had come in and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m proposing actually is that we had , for a long period of time , a situation where we had a huge choice .
There are many , many things that we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t know the prices , so much less the size .
We had no idea .
Imagine going to a restaurant and having this big menu , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , take a pizza , you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a dollar , it could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a family pizza . It could be a pizza for a single person , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And what the top of Copenhagen is really trying to do — is to put prices on these problems .
And so , this was the process of the top of Copenhagen .
We have 30 of the best economists in the world , three in every area .
So we have three of the best economists writing about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost ? And what will be the benefit that we will benefit from that ?
The same is true of transmissible diseases .
Three of the best experts in the world who say , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do , what is the recipe going to be ?
And so on .
Then we took some of the best economists in the world , eight of the world &apos;s best economists , including three Nobel laureates , to meet them in Copenhagen in May of 2004 .
We called it the dream team . The Cambridge University Prize decided to call them the Real Madrid of the economy .
This works well in Europe , but not very far down there .
And what they basically did was they popped up with a list of priorities .
So you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy you &apos;ve asked me — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know something about malaria , ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know something about climate , ask a climatologist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should worry about before , you can &apos;t ask any of the two , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That &apos;s what economists do .
They set priorities .
They do it in that task in a kind of disgusting way of saying , what should we do before , and what should we do next ?
So this is the list , and this is what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see it on the site , and we &apos;ll talk more about it , I &apos;m sure , over time .
They basically jumped out with a list where they said there were bad projects — that is , projects where if you put a dollar , you go back less than a dollar .
And then there are discrete projects , good projects and good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the optimistic projects that we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to start from the bottom so that I end up with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you can see at the bottom of the list is climate change .
This offends a lot of people , and it &apos;s probably one of those things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
How is it possible that it &apos;s gone ?
And I &apos;m going to try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of those things that you &apos;re going to disagree with in the list that you wrote .
The reason I came to say that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It doesn &apos;t mean that global warming is not happening .
It doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it means that what we can do about this is very little , at very high cost .
What they basically showed us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everybody agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
It &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
It &apos;s two to three times the help of global development that we give to the Third World every year .
And by the way , it would help very little .
All models show that it &apos;s going to set up warming by about six years in 2100 .
So the guy in Bangladesh who is in an flooding in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
That &apos;s good , but not so much .
So the idea here is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing some good .
And just to give you a word of comparison , the United Nations currently estimates that for half of that sum , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the major problems in the world .
We could make clean water , healthcare , basic health services and education to every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask , do we want to spend a double sum to do very little ?
Or half the sum to make an extraordinary amount of good ?
And that &apos;s because it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do that .
But it &apos;s to say , since we don &apos;t have them , it &apos;s simply not our first priority .
The discrete projects , notice that I &apos;m not going to commit all of them — transmissible diseases , basic health services — I just did that , just because , yes , basic health services are a fantastic thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s still very , very expensive .
Again , what it tells us is that we suddenly begin to think about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , a lot of water and health projects come out .
Again , health and water are incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities that should at least be the first ones that we have to deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the world &apos;s problems .
The fourth best problem is malaria — fighting malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about a couple million people infected every year .
It could even cost up to a percentage of GDP per year per infected country .
If we invest about 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we could halve that incidence .
We could avoid the death of 500,000 people , but more importantly , we could avoid that a billion people are infected every year .
We would significantly increase their ability to fight many of the other problems they have to fight with , of course , in the long run , even to fight global warming .
The third best was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we could make trade free , and in particular cut subsidies in the United States and Europe , we could animate the global economy at the staggering number of about 2.400 billion dollars a year , half of which would come from the Third World .
Again , the point is , we could basically pull out two or three hundred million people out of poverty , very quickly , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way to treat malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
So basically , about half of the world &apos;s population has iron , zinc , ihatred and vitamin A.
If we invested about 12 billion dollars , we could make a huge incursion in that problem .
That would be the second best investment we could do .
And the best project ever would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million new HIV / AIDS cases .
Again , what this does and what it focuses on is to say there are two very different ways that we can fight HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment , the other is prevention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would both do them .
But in a world where we don &apos;t both do them , or we don &apos;t do them very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where we should invest .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
So basically , what this focuses on is saying we can do much more by investing in prevention .
So basically for the amount of money we spend , we could make X amount of good in the treatment , and 10 times as good as prevention .
So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , first of all .
What this really does is it makes us think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like you to look at your priority list and say , have you got it wrong ?
Or did you go close to what happened here ?
Of course , one of the things is still climate change .
I find a lot of people finding very , very unlikely that we should solve it .
We should also solve climate change if not for other reasons , simply because it &apos;s a huge problem .
But of course , we &apos;re not going to solve all the problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure is , if we focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
The ones that we can do very well rather than very little .
And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , put him down really , really good .
One thing that people forget is that in 100 years when we &apos;re talking about what the major impacts of climate change are going to be , people are going to be much , much richer .
Even the most pessimistic scenario of the United Nations .
It estimates that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
Most likely , they &apos;ll be two to four times richer than we are .
And of course , we will be even richer than that .
But the point is , when we &apos;re talking about saving people or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bengalese .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch type .
And so the real point , of course , is we want to spend a lot of money helping a little over 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
Or do we want to help very poor people , right now , in Bangladesh who really need help , and who can we help at a very low cost ?
Or as Schelling says , image of being a rich man — as you &apos;ll be — a rich Chinese man , a rich bureaucrationist , a rich Congolese man , in 2100 , thinking back in 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How bizarre they have been interested in helping me a little bit with climate change , and if they &apos;re so little to help my grandfather and my great-grandfather , that they could help much more and they needed a lot more help , so I think we really need to prioritize it .
Even though I don &apos;t agree with the typical way we see this problem .
Clearly , it &apos;s mainly because climate change has such an accurate picture .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day Afghter Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it sounds great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but I don &apos;t expect Emmerich to be recruited by Brad Pitt in his next film to dig latrines in Tanzania or something like that . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t do that for a movie .
So in many ways , I think at the top of Copenhagen and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense from boring problems .
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not to make us feel good .
It &apos;s not to do things that have media attention , but it &apos;s to create places where we can actually do as well as we can .
The other objections , I think , that are important to say are that I &apos;m somehow — or we &apos;re kind of — posting a false choice .
Of course , we should solve all of this in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
I think we should solve all the things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided that we would spend twice as much as we spent , now , compared to 1970 in the developing world .
Since then , our aid has halved .
So it doesn &apos;t seem like we &apos;re on the path to solving all the big problems immediately .
Similarly , do people also say , and the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars because we don &apos;t spend them doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m certainly nothing else in favor .
If any of you guys can talk to Bush about it , that &apos;s great .
But the point is , if I had another 100 billion dollars , would we still want to spend as much money as possible , or not ?
So the real problem here is to go back and think about what the right priorities are .
Should I say briefly , the list we really have is the right list ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old white men .
And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , good ways of looking at the whole world .
So we invited 80 young people from around the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and talking English .
Most of them came , first of all , from developing countries .
They all had the same material , but they could go largely outside the discussion center , and they certainly did it to get their list .
And what was amazing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and disease on top and climate change at the bottom .
We did this many other times .
There have been many other seminarists and university students , and different things .
They all came to have the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a path in front of us to start thinking about priorities and to say , what is important in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again , we &apos;d like to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t , then can we start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the top of Copenhagen as a process .
We did it in 2004 , and we hope to bring many more people together who have much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
It looks like the right path to the world , but also starting to think about a political choice .
So starting to think about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not do things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the big things where we can make a huge amount of good , at a very low cost , now . At the end of the day , you can be disagree with the discussion of how we prioritize these , but we have to be honest and tired in saying if there &apos;s something we do , there are other things that we don &apos;t do .
If we worry too much about some things , we end up not dealing with other things .
So I hope that this will help us prioritize and think about how we can work best for the world .
Thank you .
The year is 1800 .
It &apos;s about a curious invention .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
It allows you to see tiny lifeforms invisible to the naked eye .
Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms cause terrible human diseases .
Imagine what happened to society when he realized that a British mom in a cup of tea was actually drinking a monstrous soup , not far from here . This happened in London .
Fast forward 200 years .
The monstrous soup is still around , and it &apos;s installed in developing countries around the tropics .
Malaria alone causes a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people have to be examined because at the risk of several species of malarious infections .
It &apos;s very easy to face a lot of these monsters .
They all have a face .
How is it possible that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to diagnosis their disease ?
Most importantly because the diagnosis scalability is absolutely out of reach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem is in the microscope itself .
Even though at the peak of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field analysis .
They &apos;ve never even been designed for diagnosis .
They &apos;re heavy , they &apos;re heavy , they &apos;re hard to maintain , and they cost a lot .
This picture is from Mahatma Gandhi in the 1940s using exactly the same equipment we use today to diagnose tuberculosis in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , have traveled to India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem .
We &apos;ve seen a lot of donated equipment .
We &apos;ve seen mushrooms grow under the lens of a microscope .
And we saw people with functional microscopes who didn &apos;t even know how to turn on .
From that journey and that work came the idea of what we call Foldscope .
What is a Foldscope ?
A Foldscope is an absolutely functional microscope , a microscopic platform , fluorescence , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopies made just by folding a piece of paper .
You &apos;re going to think about how this is possible .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples , and we &apos;re going to see a few of them .
It starts from a single piece of paper .
What you see here are all possible components to build a optical microscope and fluorescence .
There are three steps : there &apos;s the optical phase , the lighting phase and the masking phase .
There are micro-optics in the lower part embedded in the paper itself .
What you do is you take it , and as if it &apos;s a toy , which is , I stunt it , and I break it .
This piece of paper has no instructions , no languages .
It works in color code , which says exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
When it &apos;s done , it &apos;s kind of like this , it has all the functionality of a classic microscope , just like a XY phase , a place to put a sample , for example , here .
We didn &apos;t want to change it , because it &apos;s the optimized standard over the years , and many health workers have gotten used to it .
This is what changes , but standard coloring remains the same for many diseases .
Put this in .
There &apos;s the XY phase , then the focus phase , with a flection mechanism including in the paper itself that allows you to move and focus the lenses with micro-motions .
The interesting thing about this object , and my students hate when I do it , but I &apos;m going to do it anyway , is that these are robust tools .
I can turn it on , throw it on the ground and calm it down .
They &apos;re resistant , even though they &apos;re designed with a very flexible material , like paper .
The other funny thing is — this is what we send as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different folds in different configurations in a single folder .
I &apos;m going to pick one at random .
It turns out that this is designed specifically for malaria , because it contains specific fluorescent filters for malaria diagnosis .
The idea of a very specific diagnostic microscope comes from here .
Until now , you haven &apos;t seen what I see from one of these devices .
What I &apos;d like to do , if we can bring the lights down , please — we find that foldscope is also microscopes for projection .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — this is the section of a composite eye , and I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right here , in the direction of the board z .
You can see how the lenses are cut in this section .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I like to host this , is a mosquito and you see the antenna of a common mosquito .
Right here .
All from a simple disposal I described to you .
My wife tested in the field some of our microscopes washing my clothes every time I forgot them in the tower .
Apparently they &apos;re waterproof and — ( Laughter ) — this is fluorescent water , I don &apos;t know if you can see it .
This also shows how the projection radius works .
You can see the rays and the way it &apos;s projecting and folding .
Can we turn on the lights ?
I &apos;m going to show you very quickly , because it &apos;s running out of time , how much it costs to produce it , the best idea was to make the rotary and roll production , so we built it with 50 cents of components and costs .
( Applause ) And this allows us to think about a new paradigm in microscopic , what we call a microscope and a bicycle .
I &apos;ll give you a quick idea of some of the parts that it &apos;s made of .
Here &apos;s a piece of paper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A4 sheet .
These are the three stages you see .
The optical components , if you look at the inserts on the top right , we had to find a way to produce lenses inserted into the paper itself in large volumes , so it uses a process of self-assembly and superficial tension to insert acromatic lenses into the paper itself .
That &apos;s where the lenses go .
There are sources of light .
Basically , in the end , all the parts align with origami , because origami allows us a micron level of optical alignment .
So even though it looks like a simple toy , the engineering that contains something like this is quite sophisticated .
Here it is , and it survives .
So for us , the next step is to end experimentation on the ground .
Let &apos;s start at the end of summer .
We &apos;re at the stage where we &apos;re going to do thousands of microscopes .
It would be the first time when experimentation on the ground with the highest density of microscopes in a given place .
We started collecting malaria data , Chagas &apos;s disease and Jardiasis from patients themselves .
I want to leave you with this picture .
I didn &apos;t anticipate that before , but an interesting connection is the between scientific education on the field and global health .
What are the tools that we &apos;re providing to the kids that will fight the monstrous soup of tomorrow ?
I &apos;d like them to print a Foldscope to get it into their pocket .
Thank you .
Our world has a lot of superheroes .
But they have the worst superpowers : invisible .
For example , the strips , the workers who live to collect recyclable materials .
Strangers are born from social inequality , unemployment and abundance of solid waste from a diverse deficit collection system .
Strangers do a heavy , honest and essential job to benefit the whole population , but they &apos;re not recognized .
They get to collect over 300 pounds of waste in their bags , carrots , bicycles and carrots .
This is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
I &apos;m a graffiti and an activist , my art is about social , environmental and politics .
In 2007 , I moved my work from the walls to the prisons as a new urban support for my message .
At the same time , I gave voice to the strangers .
They &apos;re now famous for roads , mass media and social media .
I &apos;ve painted over 200 carcasses in many cities , and I &apos;ve been invited to make shows and travels all over the world .
So I realized that the strikes , in their invisibility , are not an exclusive of Brazil .
I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even developed countries like the United States and Japan .
So I realized that I needed more people to come together because it &apos;s a big challenge .
( Applause )
&quot; &quot; System my cart &quot; &quot; is a great collaborative event that helps the strips and their loved ones .
Strangers are witnessed by well-being professionals like doctors , dentists , podologists , parruckers , physical therapists and many others .
They also get security t-shirt , gloves , emmeables and glasses to see the city in high definition , and their carcasses are reneeded by our incredible volunteers .
Finally , they &apos;re painted by street artists and they become part of this great , fantastic exhibition of mobile art .
So now everybody can participate .
Because of their fixed prisons , they &apos;re able to fight prejudice to increase their income and interact with society .
So now I want to challenge you to begin to look at and recognize the strikes and other invisible superheroes in your cities .
Try to see the world as a world without borders or borders .
Believe it or not , there are over 20 million stripes in the world .
So next time you see one , recognize it as a vital part of our society .
Muito obrigado , thank you .

About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler who also talked here at TED in 2007 about Virtual Earth convinced me to become the head of Bing Maps , which is the project of online maps of Microsoft .
In the last two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working hard on redefining how maps work online .
And we &apos;re looking at this in very different terms from the kind of maps and road indications online that we &apos;re used to .
The first thing you might notice about this map online is the fluidity of the zoom in and the panoramic that if you &apos;re familiar with Seadragon , it &apos;s exactly where it came from .
Building maps is , of course , not just a matter of cartography but a matter of image .
So as soon as we zoom in over a certain point , we &apos;re in a virtual vision like Sim City at 45 degrees .
This can be seen from all directions to show you the three-dimensional structure of the city , all facades .
Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment as if it was a canvas on which all kinds of applications can overlap , the road indications are just one of these .
If you click here , you &apos;ll see some that we published , just in the last two months , since we launched it .
So , a couple of days after the Haiti disaster , we had a map of the earthquake showing previous and successive aerial images .
This wonderful application that I don &apos;t have time to show you is actually tracking hyperlocal blogs in real time , and it connects these stories , these blogs interventions with the places that they relate to .
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you a few more .
The images that we see , of course , are not just the images from the top .
These little green dots represent photosynths made out of users .
I &apos;m not going to go into the images , but photosynths is integrated into the map .
Everything that &apos;s shown in blue is an area that we &apos;ve also done a representation from the bottom .
And so , when you come down in a beaten — ( Applause ) Thank you , when you go down to the ground and you see this kind of panoramic representation , the first thing you might notice is that it &apos;s not a simple picture , but it &apos;s rather a redefinitive conception of the environment just like there &apos;s a three-dimensional city out of the top , so if I click on something to get a closer view of the fact that this transition appears as a kind of a three-dimensional design of this whole thing .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you an amusement that we &apos;ve been working on in collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
It takes Flickr &apos;s pictures that have been geo-tagged and it uses a similar process to photosynth to connect their images to our own , and I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s what I really wanted to take , but — ( Laughter ) But look — this , of course , is a rather tourism place , and there &apos;s a lot of pictures around this place , and these pictures have all been done in different times .
So this was done around five .
This is a picture of Flickr . This is our image .
And you can see that this kind of multi-source representation integrates , very deeply into the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is the possibility of traveling over time .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historical images that are out there , but there are some of them with horses and tanks and so on .
But what &apos;s interesting about this is not just the augmented visual representation of the world with contributions coming from users , but it &apos;s also the basis of augmented reality , and this is what I &apos;m going to show you in a second .
Here &apos;s just one step inside . This is interesting as well .
Okay , notice there &apos;s a roof above us right now .
We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
And this is something that we can do with a camera installed in a backpack , so we don &apos;t take photographs just on the street with cameras over the car , but we also do it within the street .
And so , you can do the same kind of &quot; &quot; catch &quot; &quot; not just with static images , but also with videos .
And we go and try it right now for the first time , live , and that really frightenes me , really , really , really .
( Laughter ) Okay .
( Whirring ) Okay , guys are there ?
( Sound ) Okay . I &apos;m doing it . I &apos;m pushing play .
I &apos;m live . There we go . There we go .
These are our friends at Pike Place Market , the lab .
( Applause ) They &apos;re transmitting live .
Okay , George , can you take a view to the corner ?
I want to show you some interesting things .
No , no . On the other hand .
Yes , yes , to the corner . I see the corner .
I don &apos;t want to show you guys yet .
Okay . I touch the corner . I see the corner , towards the corner .
Okay , let it stay .
What I wanted to show you were these interesting points here on the image because it helps you to orient , if you &apos;re right on the spot — you can think about it — this is a step further for augmented reality .
But what the hell do you do — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — Okay , reattack .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is taking the real ...
( Laughter ) Okay , give me just a moment to thank the team .
They did a fantastic job to put all of this together .
( Applause ) Now I &apos;ll leave them and come back .
And as I go out , I tell you that here , we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can use it the same way on the spot , for augmented reality .
When you use it on the spot , it means you can reconnect to all those metadata and information about the world .
So here , let &apos;s take another step further in terms of transmission .
And by the way , we transmitted on a 4G mesh .
OK , and there &apos;s one of the last discussions that Microsoft has done at TED in the last few years .
And this is Curtis Wong , the Planetary Telescope .
We go to the garbage geons , where traditionally , after a long day in the market , you go for a break , but also look at the sky .
This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope in our maps .
( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time , but if we run out of time , we can see how the sky was in different waters , and everything very detailed information about different waters , different days we move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe we change the day .
I &apos;d like to zoom in on the moon .
So this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated directly with the Earth .
Well now , I &apos;ve finished my time , so I &apos;m going to stop here .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about two things today . One , of what we &apos;ve lost , two , of how to bring it back .
I &apos;d like to start with this .
This is my baseline . This is the coast of the Mediterranean without fish , with the nude rocks and many sea urchins of algae .
Something like that is what I saw when I first immersed myself in the Mediterranean off Spain .
If an alien came down on Earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe jumped into a coral reef , it would be a lot of the things that he could see .
It &apos;s very unlikely that Joe can dive into an intact coral reef , a virgin barrier with a lot of corals , sharks , crocodiles , flashes , cernies , turtles , etc .
So , probably , what Joe would see would be here , in the worthy part of the picture .
Here we see the other extreme : dead corals , microorganisms in abundance and jellyfish .
Where the subaquarium is , you know , is probably the most striking place in the world right now , with very few corals , algae that are growing the corals , many bacteria , a place where the large animals have disappeared .
This is what most scientists have seen as well .
This is their reference point . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with underwater diving very long after we started polluting the marine ecosystem .
I &apos;m going to take you all to a time machine , going to the left and go back in time to see what the ocean used to look like .
Let &apos;s start our journey in time from here , the Equatorial Islands , where we conducted a series of expeditions for National Geographic .
This is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati crossing the Equator . It &apos;s made up of different inhabitable islands , not exploited for fishing and contaminate more of the inhabitable islands .
Let &apos;s start with the first one , Ice Christmas : over 5,000 people .
Most of the barriers have died . Most of the corals have died , covered in algae . Most of the fish are smaller than the pencil we use to count them .
Here in 2005 , we did 250 hours of immersion .
We didn &apos;t even see a shark .
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 , and he looked at a huge abundance of sharks that blushed the timons and the rhythms of their little boats as they approached the bank .
Let &apos;s take another little step back in time .
The Fanning Olympic , 2,500 people .
Corals are better here . There are lots of little fish .
This is what many subs would call an paradise .
This is what you can see in almost all the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
Many people think it &apos;s really wonderful , if that &apos;s your starting point .
If we go back to a place like the Palmyra Area , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are better and there are sharks .
You can see them on every single dive .
It &apos;s a pretty unusual thing for coral reefs today .
But if we take the laptops 200 , 500 years back , we &apos;ll find places where the corals are absolutely healthy and disgusting to form spectacular structures and where predators are something easily detectable , where you can see from 25 to 50 sharks in every dive .
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the ecological pyramid .
If we took all the fish from a coral reef and weighed it , that &apos;s what we would expect .
Most of the biomass is at the bottom of the food chain : the herbivores , the pale fish and the historians that eat algae .
Then you have plankton eaters , little damn fish , all the little fish swimming in the water .
Then we have a smaller biomass of carnivores , and a smaller biomass at the top , sharks , big dentists and big cernies .
But this is a consequence .
This worldview is a consequence of studying impoverted barriers .
When we went to uncontacted barriers , we realized that the natural world was underground . This pyramid was inverted .
The top part contains most of the biomass , achieving , in some places , 85 percent : an example is Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
The good news is that , besides being more predators , there &apos;s more than anything .
The size of these boxes is larger .
There are sharks , there &apos;s more dental biomass and even more biomass than herbivores , like pale fish , basically marine goats .
They clean up the barrier : everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat it , they keep the barrier clean and allow the corals to reject .
Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — they host a lot of fish , but they also host other important components of the ecosystem , such as giant slugs , entire slugs of giant slugs in the lagoon , up to 25 , 25 per square meter .
They disappeared from every barrier in the world , but they filter water ; they keep clean water from microbes and pathogens .
Like if that wasn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s global warming now .
If you don &apos;t fish because these barriers are protected by law or their inaccessibility , it &apos;s a great thing .
But if the water gets warmer too long , the corals die .
What help can these fish and these predators give ?
What we noticed is that , in this particular area in the 1997 and &apos; 98 , years of El Nino , water was too hot for too long , and many corals lost color and many died .
On the island of Christmas , where the biomass is impoverished at the extreme , where large animals have disappeared , the corals have not recovered .
Not even on the Fanning island , the corals recovered .
But here you can see a big coral that died and broke .
So the fish have shredded algae , and so the algae manta is slower .
And then we move to the Palmyra atol where the biomass of herbivores is larger , and we see that corals are clean , and they &apos;re increasing again .
When we reach an incontaminated place — have they ever lost color ?
Yes , they suffered , but they recovered faster .
The more intact , the more complex , the more complex the food chain , the higher the resistance , the more likely the system is to recover faster than the short-term impacts of an area warming .
That &apos;s good news . And we need to recover this structure .
We have to make sure that all the pieces of the ecosystem are present so that the system can adapt to the effects of climate change .
We need to reserve the starting point , we need to push the ecosystem to the left of the pattern , and how can we do that ?
Well , there are several ways .
One of the things that &apos;s very clear is marine protected reserves , especially reserves with whole fisheries , which we create to allow the recovery of marine life .
I &apos;d like to go back to the picture of the Mediterranean .
It was my starting point . It was what I saw as a child .
But at the same time I was watching Jaques Cousteau &apos;s show on TV and seeing all that wealth , that abundance , that diversity .
I thought that wealth was exclusive of tropical seas and that the Mediterranean was a normal , poor sea .
Or at least I thought , until I first jumped into a marine reserve .
This is what I saw , millions of fish .
After a few years , pretty much after five , seven years , the fish come back , eat the recipes , and so the algae can grow back .
At first there are only small algae , and in a rectangle of the size of a laptop , you can find more than 100 species of algae , many of which microscopic , and hundreds of fish , of small animals that fish feed on , the ecosystem can recover .
This particular place , the Medes Iands Marine Reserve , covers only 94 acres , but it carries six million Euros in the local home , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the revenues of tourism .
These places not only help the ecosystem but also help people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
I &apos;d like to summarize what protected reserves can do .
When we actually protect these places . When we compare them to unprotected adjacent areas , that &apos;s what happens .
The number of species grows by 21 percent , so if we have 1,000 species , we can expect 200 more in a reserve .
It &apos;s very impressive .
The size of organisms grows by a third . So fish are now this big .
The abundance , the number of fish that are in a square meter , grows by almost 170 percent .
And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — it &apos;s 4.5 times bigger on average , after only five or seven years .
Sometimes you get to a biomass 10 times bigger inside the protected areas .
So we find all these organisms that grow inside the reserve , and what do they do ?
They reproduce . This is biology at the base .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they live longer , they get bigger and they reproduce over and over again .
Same talk for invertebrates . Here &apos;s an example .
These are eggs made from a snail off the coast of Cilena . Here &apos;s how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
Out of the protected area , we can &apos;t find them .
1.3 million eggs per square meter inside the reserve where these snails are abundant .
So organisms breed . Small larvae move , all organisms move , and so people outside the reserve can benefit from it .
This is in the Bahamas , a striped cernia .
We find lots of cernies in the reserves , and the closer we get , the more fish we find .
So fishermen also take more of it .
You can see where the boundaries of reserves are from the aligned boats along them .
So fish are spreading . There are benefits beyond the boundaries of reserves that help people live in the vicinity , and at the same time reserve protects the entire habitat ; it develops recovery skills .
Basically , what we have now in a world with no reserves is like a current account that we take all the time and never make a versation .
The reserves are saving bribes .
We need to put them in our heads not to touch them so that they produce social , economic and ecological outcomes .
And if we think about the growth of biomass within the reserves , we can think of it as a composite interest .
Let me give you two more examples of how reserves come back to human advantage .
This is what fishermen earn every day in Kenya , fishing for a number of years in a place where there &apos;s no protection ; everyone weighs what they want .
When the most harmful fishing gear , the circuit networks were put out , the fishermen were taking more fish .
If you weigh less , you actually take more .
But if we add a protected area to all of this , fishermen earn even more money from fishing around a protected area .
Another example : stripping cernies in Belize on the MesoAmerican platform .
These are mating cernies , the cernies come together in the moonshot times in December and January for a week .
They used to gathered in groups of tens of thousands — 300,000 grouper of these dimensions in a hectare , in one group .
The fishermen knew about these clusters ; they fished and ran out of them .
When I first went there in 2000 , there were only 10,000 cernies left .
Also , fishermen were allowed to fish 30 percent of all the new born every year .
We did a simple analysis , and it &apos;s not very complicated to understand that if you weigh 30 percent per year your fishing activity will collapse very quickly .
And along with that disappears the entire reproductive capacity of the species .
It happened in many different places in the Caribbean .
And there were about 4,000 dollars a year , total , all over the fisheries , with a lot of boats involved .
Now , if we do an economic analysis and make a projection of what would happen if the fish weren &apos;t exterminated , if we just took 20 subs for a month a year , the revenge would be more than 20 times higher , and more importantly it would be sustainable over time .
How many such areas do we have ?
If it &apos;s so beautiful , and if it &apos;s so easy to understand , how many protected areas do we have ?
You &apos;ve heard it already : less than one percent of the ocean is protected .
We &apos;re approaching one percent now because of the protection of the Chagos archipelago , and only a fraction of it is completely viable to fishing .
Scientific studies indicate that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
The estimated percentage is between 20 and 50 percent because they achieved a range of biodiversity targets , development of fish and recovery skills .
Now , is it possible ? People ask , how much would this cost ?
Well , let &apos;s think about how much we &apos;re spending right now for fishing subsidies , 35 billion dollars a year .
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing methods .
There are a couple of estimates of what it would cost to create a network of protected areas to cover 20 percent of the ocean , and it &apos;s estimated that it would only cost a fraction of what we spend now , of what governments regulate to collapse .
People are losing their jobs because fishing zones collapse .
The creation of a network of protected areas would work directly to more than a million people without counting the jobs connected and all the secondary benefits .
How can we do this ?
If it &apos;s so obvious that these short savings rates are a good idea for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t they cover 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
And how can we get there ?
Well , there are two ways to get there .
The obvious solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos archipelago .
The problem is that we can create these huge reserves only in places where there are no people , there are no social conflict , where political costs are very low and it &apos;s also low economic costs .
Some of us , some organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on it .
But how do we do for the rest of the world &apos;s shores , where people live and earn a living with fish ?
There are three main reasons why there are not tens of thousands of small reserves , and the first is that people have no idea what reserves can do , and fishermen tend to be very , very much about defensive when they &apos;re talking about regular or closing a zone , even if they &apos;re small .
Secondly , management is not adequate because almost all the coastal communities in the world don &apos;t have the authority to manage the resources to create the reserve and respect it .
It &apos;s a hierarchical structure at the pyramid where people expect government officials to come . It &apos;s not an efficient method , and governments don &apos;t have enough resources .
And that brings us to the third reason , and the reason we don &apos;t have much more reserves is that funding models are wrong .
NGOs and governments spend a lot of time , energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
So conservation and ocean protection became a public and private money discharge , and that &apos;s not sustainable .
The solutions are in solving these three questions .
First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create completely better protected areas than we have right now .
It &apos;s always the story of the short savings story compared to the current account where we never come .
Secondly , we need to redesign our directive systems so that conservation efforts can be decentralized , and they don &apos;t depend on the work of NGOs or government agencies , and that they can be created by local communities as it happens in the Philippines and some other places .
Third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
Money discharge as one way to create protected areas is not sustainable .
We really need to develop models , financial models , where coastal conservation is an investment . We already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
I &apos;d like to end with a thought , and say that no organization alone will save the ocean .
There &apos;s been a lot of competition in the past , and we have to develop a new really collaborative cooperation model , where we &apos;re going to look for complementary , not replacement .
The stakes are simply too high to keep on the way we are .
We have to act . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
Chris Anderson : A really wonderful job of collecting and exposure .
First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid that shows 85 percent of the biomass composed of predators , seems really impossible .
How can 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
Enric Sala : Well , imagine you have two dental wheels of a watch , a big one and a small one .
The big one moves very slowly , and the little one moves very fast .
That &apos;s basically it .
The animals in the lower layers of the food chain are breeding very quickly , growing very fast , deposing millions of eggs .
And up here are sharks and big fish that live 25 , 30 years old .
They breed very slowly . They have slow metabolism . They basically do nothing but keep their biomass .
At the end , the productive surplus of organisms at the bottom is enough to maintain this biomass that doesn &apos;t move .
I &apos;m sort of a condenser for the system .
Chris Anderson : Very fascinating .
So , in fact , our image of the food pyramid is completely — we have to completely change it .
Enric Sala : Surely in the sea .
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , where there are five lions for every wild animal .
On the ground , this pattern can &apos;t work .
But surely coral reefs are a system where there &apos;s a component at the bottom that has a structure .
And we think it &apos;s universal .
But we started studying uncontacted barriers just recently .
Chris Anderson : The numbers you showed us are amazing .
You say we spend 35 billion dollars right now in subsidies .
It would only cost 16 billion to transform 20 percent of the ocean into protected marine reserves that actually provide new life choices even to fishermen .
If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for less than 19 billion dollars .
We would have 19 billion to spend on health care or something else .
Enric Sala : And we also need to consider the scarce fishing productivity that costs another 50 billion dollars .
Again , one of the great solutions is to persuade the World Trade Organization to shift subsidies to sustainable practice .
Chris Anderson : All right , there are a lot of examples that are being around about how to stop this mad of the subsidies .
Thank you for those numbers .
One last personal question .
Many of the experiences lived by the people in this room , who have been through the oceans for a long time , have been able to degrade , places that used to be wonderful and ruined , have died .
Talk to me about the feeling that you have to feel when you &apos;ve reached those areas that are uncontacted and you &apos;ve seen things come back .
Enric Sala : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We go there trying to understand the ecosystem , trying to measure and count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from what we know .
But the best feeling is this biofilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , when humans experience this sense of admiration and wonder in front of wild nature , in the wild nature .
And there , just there , you really feel like you &apos;re part of a bigger thing , part of a global ecosystem .
And if it wasn &apos;t for these places full of hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this work .
It would be too depressing .
Chris Anderson : Well , Enric , thank you very much for sharing with us a little bit of that spiritual experience . Thank you .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
It &apos;s 1995 , and with a friend of mine , we take a trip from Providence , Rhode Island in Portland , Oregon .
You know what it is , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we take all the secondary streets through regional parks and national forests — basically we take the longest road there is .
And somewhere in the middle of the South Dakota , I turn to my friend and ask her a question that was coming back from over 3,000 miles .
&quot; How about the Chinese character that I keep seeing on the street ? &quot;
My friend looks crazy to me .
Well , there &apos;s a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s imitating it perfectly .
( Laughter ) And I say to her , &quot; &quot; But yes , those signs that we continue to see with that Chinese character . &quot; &quot; She looks at me for a moment , and then she laughs , because she figured out what I &apos;m talking about .
And I &apos;m talking about this .
( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese ideogram that indicates a picnic area . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations like this — about why we sometimes misinterpret the signs around us , how we behave when it happens , and what can tell us all about human nature ?
In other words , as Chris said , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about wrong .
It may sound like a strange choice for my career , but it also has a huge advantage : there is no competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything to avoid thinking about wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we &apos;re wrong .
We just take it aside .
We know that everyone in this room is making mistakes .
In general , the human species makes mistakes — OK .
But when it comes to me , of all I believe in , right now in the present , suddenly this recognition that we &apos;re not infallible ends out of the window — and I struggle to think about something that I &apos;m wrong about .
The fact is that the present time is what we live in .
In the present time , we go to meetings ; we go on vacation with our families ; in the present time we go to the voting polls .
In fact , we place order by traveling through life , trapped in this bubble that makes us feel right compared to everything .
I think it &apos;s a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us , as individuals , in our private and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us from a cultural standpoint .
What I mean to do today , first of all , is to talk about why we &apos;re stuck in this feeling of being in the right place .
And then , because it &apos;s such a problem .
Finally , I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to abandon this attitude and that , if you can do that , you &apos;ve made the single largest , moral , intellectual and creative jump that you can do .
So why are we stuck in this attitude of being right ?
One of the reasons has to do with the idea of being wrong .
Let me ask you a question — or rather , let me ask you a question because you &apos;re here : How do you feel — emotionally — how do you feel when you &apos;re wrong ?
It &apos;s very bad . It &apos;s very hot .
It &apos;s embarrassing . Okay , perfect , right .
Despite , thumb to , it &apos;s embarrassing — thank you , these are perfect answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
You &apos;re responding to me : How do you feel you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) But realizing that torture can make you feel like this and many other ways , right ?
I mean , it can be devastating , or it can be revelatory , or it can be funny , like my stupid mistake on Chinese ideogram .
But getting wrong doesn &apos;t make us feel any way .
Let me give you an example .
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s that pathetic coyote that &apos;s always there chasing and never captures Beep Beep ?
Basically in every episode of this cardboard , there &apos;s a time when the coyote chases Beep Beep and the bird jumps down a cliff , which is okay , it &apos;s a bird , it can fly .
The fact is that the coyote runs behind him and goes down at once .
The thing that makes people laugh — at least if you &apos;re still six years old — is that even coyote doesn &apos;t bend .
He keeps running — until he looks down and realizes he &apos;s in midair .
It &apos;s only then that it falls .
When we get wrong about something — not when we see it , but first — we &apos;re like that coyote after jumping off the cliff but not looking down .
You know , we &apos;ve made the mistake already , we &apos;re already in the shepheres , but we still feel like we &apos;re in an iron bat .
I should actually agree on something I said a little earlier .
You feel something wrong ; you feel right .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s a structural reason why you &apos;re stuck in this attitude of being in the right .
I call it failure blindness .
In most cases , we &apos;re not given any internal clue that allows us to understand when we &apos;re wrong , until it &apos;s too late .
There &apos;s also a second reason why we &apos;re stuck in this Egypt — and it &apos;s cultural nature .
Think for a moment about elementary years .
You &apos;re sitting in the classroom , and the teacher gives you the homework , and one looks like this .
This is not mine , I want to point out .
( Laughter ) So here you are in school , and you know exactly what to think about the child who did that task .
It &apos;s the tuna child , the combina-gai , the one that never does homework .
So when you reach the age of nine , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that the ones who are wrong are lazy and irresponsible tuna — and as a second thing , that in order to succeed in life you never have to make mistakes .
This lesson we learn from perfection .
And many of us — and I suspect , especially many of us here today — face it just by becoming the first of the class , perfectionists , success .
Right , Mr. financial , astrophysicist and ultramaratonet ?
( Laughter ) Now it turns out you &apos;re all financial directors , astrophysics , ultramaratonets .
Okay , perfect .
Except then we go to paranoia to the only chance that we &apos;re wrong .
Because according to this logic , getting wrong about something is about having something wrong with us .
So we persevered to want to be right , because it makes us feel brilliant and accountable virtuous and safe .
Let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , a woman came to Beth Israel Deaconess hospital for an operation .
Beth Israel in Boston .
It &apos;s the Harvard university hospital — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and is brought to the operating room .
They make them anesthesia , the surgeon does what he has to do — the recipe , send it back to reanimation .
Everything seems to have gone for the best .
She wakes up , looks at her , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why did they leave me on the wrong side ? &quot; &quot; Well , they dumped her the wrong part of the body because the surgeon did an operation with the fibers on her left leg rather than on the right .
When the vice president for the quality of the hospital healthcare system told this incident , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; Whatever the reason was , the surgeon believed he was on the right side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The nugget of the story is that trusting too much of feeling on the right side of anything can be dangerous .
This deep feeling of being in the right that so often we all try is not a reliable guide for everything that happens in the real world .
Comporting it as if it were , and by stopping contemplating the possibility that maybe we &apos;re wrong , that &apos;s when we end up doing things like cutting 800 million liters of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or silizzing the global economy .
This is a huge practical problem .
But also with a social flap .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think what you believe perfectly reflects reality .
And when you feel like this , you have a problem to solve , which is how are you going to explain why so many people disagree with you ?
So it turns out that we &apos;re in many people to give us the same explanation , and we rely on a whole series of unfortunate assumptions .
The first thing we do when someone disagree with us is to assume that they are ignorant people .
People who don &apos;t have access to the same information that we have , and that when we share generously with them this information , they will see light and they will deploy on our side .
When the assumption doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out they know exactly what we know and continue not to agree with us , then we go to the second assumption , which is , they &apos;re idiots .
( Laughter ) They have all the pieces of the puzzle , but they &apos;re too cracky to put them together correctly .
And if that doesn &apos;t work too , when it turns out that people who don &apos;t agree with us disagree with our own information and are quite smart people , then we get out the third assumption : that they know the truth , and they deliberately distort it for their own biecko back .
And it &apos;s a catastrophe .
This attachment to feel on the right side doesn &apos;t help us prevent mistakes when we &apos;re going to have an absolute need and drive us to treat each other .
For me , the most staggering and tragic thing about this is that it makes us lose the last sense of being human .
It &apos;s as if we wanted to believe that our minds are perfectly transparent windows through which we look outside and describe reality as it happens .
And we want everyone to look out of this same window and see exactly the same thing .
That doesn &apos;t correspond to truth , and if that were the case , life would be really boring .
The miracle of our mind is not that it allows us to see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that we can see it as it is not .
We can remember the past , we can think about the future , and we can imagine what someone else would be like in some other place .
And each of us does it differently , and that &apos;s why we all look at the same blue at night and see this and this one and also this .
And yes , of course , that &apos;s also why we &apos;re wrong .
1,200 years before Descartes pronounced the famous phrase , &quot; I think so I &apos;m , &quot; &quot; This guy , Saint Augustine , who had been thinking and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; So I &apos;m blank . &quot;
Augustine understood that our ability to combine trouble , is not one of the many embarrassing flaws in the human system , something that can be expanded or overcome .
It &apos;s deeply linked to our identity .
Because unlike God , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s really happening out there .
And unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to understand it .
For me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productive and creative capacity .
Last year , for various reasons , I found myself following many points of radio transmission This American Life .
Imagine , I &apos;m listening and listening , and then at some point , I feel like all the stories are related to being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I drank my brain .
I became the crazy lady of the mistake .
And I see this thing everywhere , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s exactly what happened .
But two months later , I had the opportunity to interview Ira Glass , the conductor of the program .
I present to him this thing , and he says , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s actually true .
In fact , &quot; &quot; Go on , &quot; &quot; among colleagues , we always joke that every single dot in the program has the same secret theme .
And the secret theme is , &quot; &quot; I thought something would happen , and something else happened . &quot; &quot; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; Ira Glass says , &quot; &quot; we need it .
We need these moments of surprise , of inversion and inprecision because these narratives work . &quot; &quot; And all of us , general public , that we &apos;re listeners or readers for this stuff , we &apos;re going crazy .
In stories , we like unintended evidence and finals to surprise .
When it comes to telling stories , we like to make mistakes .
Of course , we know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think something else is going to happen , and something else happens .
George Bush thought he was attacking Iraq , finding a lot of weapons of mass destruction , liberating a people and bringing democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened .
Hosni Mubarak also thought he would be a dictator of Egypt all his life , until he was too old or sick and he would spend all the powers of his son .
And something else happened .
And maybe you thought you &apos;d grow up , you &apos;d be married with your high school boyfriend and you &apos;d be back to your hometown to grow your parks together .
And something else happened .
And I have to tell you that I also thought about the book that I was writing as a failure on a issues that everybody hates and for a public that would never be concretized .
And something else happened .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
In good and bad , we build these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns in another direction and amazes us .
Without offense , but this whole conference is an incredible monument to our ability to fail .
We spent a week talking about innovation , development and improvement , but you know why we need these developmental and improvement innovations ?
Because only half the stuff is really incredible and it &apos;s going to change the world — TED 1998 — hh .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t really work that way , right ? ( Laughter )
Where my backpack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) There we go . We laugh .
Things always go like this .
And we respond to another idea .
Let &apos;s tell another story .
Or take another talk .
The theme of this , as many of you have repeated all millions of times , is the coverage of wonder .
For me , if you really want to marvel you again , you have to decide to go out of the tiny , terrifying space of being in the right and look around you and look at the immense complexity , the mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause )
On November 5 , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair entered a hotel in Manhattan and murdered the Rabbino Meir Kahane , the leader of the League of Ebraic Defense .
Nosair was initially declared not guilty , but while he served a minor accusation , he began planning attacks , along with other men , a dozen nevralic points in New York City , including tunnel , synagogue and the central seats of the United Nations .
Fortunately , those plans were inspired by an FBI informant .
Unfortunately , it wasn &apos;t the case for the World Trade Center in 1993 .
Nosair was convicted of his engagement in the conspiracy .
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , 1983 , my father , an Egyptian engineer , and an loving American mother , elementary school teacher , who together circled in all ways to give me happy childhood .
It was only at the age of seven that in our family , dynamics started to change .
My father introduced me to a side of Islam that a few people , including most Muslims , can see .
I know from experience that when people take time to interact with each other , they quickly realize that , mostly , in life , we &apos;re looking for all the same things .
However , in every religion , in every population , you will find a small percentage of people so ferociously attached to their beliefs that they must be able to use any means necessary to make others live like them .
A few months before his arrest , he sat down and explained to me that , in the last weekends , he and some friends had gone to a portrait polymer in Long Island to practice .
He told me I was going to go with him the next morning .
We got to Calverton &apos;s typeface polymer , which at the beknownst of our group was being watched by the FBI .
When it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me keep the gun on my shoulder and explained how to target the target at about 28 meters away .
That day , the last bullet I shot hit the orange light on top of the target and surprised everyone , but in particular mine , the target caught fire .
My uncle turned to other men , and in Arabic he said , &quot; &quot; ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Tale father , that son .
Everybody seemed to laugh at crabs , after that comment , but only a few years later , I realized what they thought was funny .
They thought they were seeing in me the same destructive that my father was capable of .
Those men were then convicted for putting a van with 700 kilograms of explosion in the basement of a World Trade Center parking lot , causing an explosion that killed six people and stopped 1,000 more .
That was the kind of people I faced .
That was the kind of people I called &quot; &quot; ammu , &quot; &quot; uncle .
At the age of 19 , I had already transferred 20 times in my life , and that instability , during my childhood , was awarded me the opportunity to make real friends .
Every time I started feeling comfortable with someone , it was time for me to do the suitcase and move .
Being the eternal &quot; &quot; new face &quot; &quot; of the class , I was often targeted by the bullets .
I kept my identity secretly from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but apparently , being the new package of the class was already enough .
So I spent most of my time at home , reading books , watching TV or playing video games .
So I was socially charming , to use a euphemism , and growing up in such an intolerant environment , I wasn &apos;t ready for the real world .
I &apos;ve been trained to judge people on the basis of arbitrary parameters , like race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of the first experiences that challenged my thinking about how I lived during the 2000 presidential elections .
Through a university preparation program , I could be part of the National Raduno of Youth in Philadelphia .
The focus of my group was about the violence of young people , and being a victim of bullying for most of my life , I was particularly passionate about this topic .
The members of our group came from different walks of life .
One day , at the end of the convention , I discovered that one of the kids I had done friends with was Jewish .
It took several days for that detail to come to light , and I realized there was no natural hostility between us .
I had never had a Jewish friend , and frankly I was proud to be able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life had led me to believe ininsurmountable .
Another turning point was when I found a summer job at the Busch Gardens , a playground .
There I connected with people of all religion and culture , and that experience turned out to be fundamental in the development of my character .
For most of my life , I was taught that homosexuality was a sin , and that , as a result , all gay people were negative influence .
But at random , I had the opportunity to work with gay artists at a show , and soon I discovered that many of them were among the most good people , and less critical people I &apos;d ever met .
Being a bullying victim created a sense of empathy to other people &apos;s suffering , and now it &apos;s not natural to treat good people differently than I would like to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to counteract the inculcatic stereotypes as a child with real life experiences and interactions .
I don &apos;t know what it means to be gay , but I know what it means to be judged for something that is outside my control .
Then there was &quot; &quot; Daily Show . &quot; &quot; Every night , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself on my intolerance and helped me realize that the race of one person , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of their character .
In a way , it was a father for me when I was desperately searching for one .
The inspiration can often come from unexpected places , and the fact that a Jewish comedian did more , to positively influence the view of the world , of a extremist like my father remained inside me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my view of the world was changing , and she told me something that I will bring in my heart all my life .
He looked at me with the stark eyes of those who tried dogmatism to be enough for a whole life , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy required all that hatred .
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to cut the bridges with my father and start a new life .
Why , then , should I get out of the closet and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I do it in the hope that maybe someone , someday , forced to use violence , can hear my story and realize that there &apos;s a better way to do that , although I &apos;ve been submitted to this violent , intolerant ideology , I haven &apos;t become fanatic .
I chose instead of using my experience to counter terrorism , intolerance .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism imposed them .
For the victims of terrorism , I &apos;m going to speak openly against these insensible acts and I &apos;m going to condense my father &apos;s actions .
With that simple fact , I &apos;m here to prove that violence is not intrinsic to religion or race , and the child is not held to follow the father &apos;s footprints .
I &apos;m not my father .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
I &apos;m honored with the invitation , thank you .
I &apos;d like to talk about interesting things for me , but unfortunately , I &apos;m afraid what interests me is not a lot of other people .
First of all , my little card says I &apos;m an astronomer .
I &apos;d like to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people interested in radiative transport in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in the high atmosphere of Jupiter corresponds to the number of people who can be under a bus retirement .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about this .
( Laughter ) And it would be just as funny to talk about things that happened in 1986 or 1987 , when a hacker was infiltrating into our systems at the Lawrence Berkeley Laborators .
I captured the guy , and it turns out he worked for the time , KGB Soviet , stole information and sell it back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about this — it would be fun — but 20 years later ...
I find computer security quite a bit boring .
That &apos;s a real achievement .
I — the first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second one is engineering .
The third is just being a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do one thing , I do another one .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about this .
And I &apos;m not even going to talk about the statements that I think are obvious from my first book Silicon Snake Oil , or my second book , I &apos;m going to talk about why I think computers don &apos;t have to go into schools .
I think there &apos;s a curious and widespread belief that you need to bring more computers into schools .
My idea is : No ! No !
Get them out of schools and leave them out .
And I &apos;d like to talk about this , but I think the topic is totally obvious to anyone who &apos;s been in a fourth grade and that you don &apos;t need to talk about it again — I think I might have come back , and a lot of that , and all I just said .
Then don &apos;t go and read my dissertation .
It probably includes lies .
And with that , I &apos;ve been disappointed my talk five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And if you look right here , the most important thing I wrote on my thumb is the future .
I should talk about the future , right ?
Well , my feeling is that it &apos;s strange to ask me to talk about the future , because I have gray hair , then it seems silly to me that I talk about the future .
In fact , if you really want to know what the future will look like , if you really want to know something about the future , don &apos;t ask a technician , to a scientist , to a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask anyone who writes programming code .
No , if you want to know what social society will look like in 20 years , ask the asylum teachers .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask one of the teachers , ask one who has experience .
They know what social society will be like in the next generation .
I don &apos;t know . And even , I suspect , everyone who talks about what the future will lead to us .
Of course , anyone can imagine all those beautiful things that will be there .
But for me , things are not the future .
What I &apos;m asking is what society will be like when today &apos;s children are phenomenal with messengers and they &apos;re for very long time in front of a screen , but they &apos;ve never played bowling in the company .
The change is happening , and the change that happens is not what &apos;s happening in software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d like to talk about it , it would be fun , but I want to talk about what I currently do . What am I doing right now ?
Oh — the other thing I &apos;d like to talk about is right here . Right here .
Can you see ? What I &apos;d like to talk about are objects on one surface .
I really want to talk about things that only have one surface .
Because I like Mobius &apos;s rings . I don &apos;t just love Mobius &apos;s rings , but I &apos;m one of the few , if not the only one in the world , building Klein &apos;s bottles .
So here , I hope you &apos;re all pissed .
This is a bottle of Klein .
For those in the audience who already know , raise your eyes on the sky and say SI , I know everything .
It has one side . It &apos;s a bottle in which it &apos;s its outer .
It has zero volume . It &apos;s not orientable .
It has amazing properties .
If you take two rings of Mobius and climb the edge that they have in common , you &apos;ll get one of these , and I made them out of glass .
And I &apos;d like to talk a lot about it , but I don &apos;t have a lot of — things to say why — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I have a cold . ) Anyway , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; TED &quot; &quot; is obviously for design .
Just two weeks ago , I built — you know , I made bottles of Klein small , middle and big enough to trade .
But what I built — and I &apos;m pleased to present it here for the first time in public .
This is a bottle of Klein for wine , which , despite four dimensions and doesn &apos;t have to be able to hold a fluid , is perfectly capable of doing it because our universe only has three dimensions of space .
And because our universe has only three dimensions of space , it &apos;s able to contain fluid .
So it &apos;s mostly — this is the best one .
It &apos;s a month of my life .
Even if I really want to talk to you about topology , I won &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to remember my mom , who was missing last summer .
He would collect my pictures , like my moms do .
Could anybody turn on this thing ?
I saw her album last year and I found a picture of me standing up — well , sitting in 1969 , in front of a group of diamonds .
I looked at it and I said , my God ! This is me when I was working at the electronic music studio !
I worked as a technician , repair and maintenance the electronic music studio at the SUNY of Buffalo . Wow !
ancient Machine . And I said , &quot; &quot; I !
And it sent me back in time .
Right after that , I found another photograph in her album , a picture of me .
This guy here is clearly me .
This is Robert Moog , the inventor of Moog &apos;s synthesizer , who came to eat last August .
Robert Moog was a generous , gentle man , an extraordinarily competent engineer .
A musician who took his life to teach me , a second-year student , a new student arrived at the SUNY of Buffalo .
It came from Trumnansburg to teach me not just Moog &apos;s synthesizer , but we were sitting there — I studied physics then . It &apos;s 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a great thing .
Don &apos;t take you from the electronic music if you &apos;re studying physics . &quot; &quot; He would mentor me . He would come and spend hours and hours with me .
He wrote for me a letter of recommendation for college admission .
On the background , my bicycle .
I realize that this picture was made in the living room of a friend of mine .
Bob Moog came there with a lot of material just to explain to Greg Flint and to me things like this .
In the living room , we were talking about Fourier transformations , Bessel &apos;s function , modulation transfer functions , things like that .
Bob &apos;s death last summer was a loss for all of us .
There &apos;s no musician who has not been deeply influenced by Robert Moog .
( Applause ) Now I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . What I &apos;m going to do — I hope you can recognize a distorted sine wave , a almost triangular wave on this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
Great . Now I can go to this , right ?
Children . Children are what I &apos;m going to talk about . Right ?
Here &apos;s children written , here &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
I decided that , at least for me , I don &apos;t have a big head .
And so I think locally and I act locally .
I think the best way to put a hand in anything is to do it very locally .
So the Ph.D. here , graduation , and all the escape .
I was talking about it with a group of teachers about a year ago .
And one of them , many of them turned to me and said , &quot; How come you never teach ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I taught graduate students — I had graduate students , I also taught high school classes . &quot; &quot; &quot; No , they said , if you &apos;re so taken by children , how come you &apos;re not here in the front line ?
It goes from the words to the facts . &quot; &quot; Right . Right . I now teach science to third-grade students four days a week .
And I don &apos;t just show myself every now and then .
No , no , no , no , no . There are always .
Even at lunch . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , it &apos;s not for your applause .
I &apos;m convinced that this is a great thing to do for each of you .
You don &apos;t just get into the classroom every now and then .
You teach the whole week . Okay , I do it for three quarters of the week , but that &apos;s enough .
One of the things I did for my science students was to say , &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;m going to teach you physics that teaches you at college .
No calculation , we jump .
You don &apos;t need to know trigonometry .
But you have to know the algebra that is in the third grade , and so we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
Nothing like &quot; &quot; aprite-al-capitol-sevente-by-by-by-by-five &quot; &quot; problem .
We &apos;re going to do real physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m going to try to do now .
( Singing ) Oh , before we even turned on this tool , one of the things we did in the classroom three weeks ago — this is because of the lenses , and one of the things we did with the lens was to measure the speed of light .
My students at El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a chorot of oscilloscope , measured the speed of light .
With a 25 percent approximation . How many third-grade students do you know capable of measuring the speed of light ?
In addition to that , we measured the speed of sound .
I &apos;d like to measure the speed of light right here .
I had organized myself to do this here and I thought , &quot; &quot; Great , &quot; &quot; I was about to impose my presence to the constituted powers , and measure the speed of light .
I was so organized , organized to actually do it , but then it turns out that to scale the equipment is only 10 minutes .
And there &apos;s no time to do that .
So next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light .
But meanwhile , we measure the speed of sound !
Well , the obvious method of measuring the speed of sound is to make sound bounce on something and measure the echo .
But probably — one of my students , Ariel , asked , &quot; Can we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
And you all know that the wave equation is : the multiplied frequency for wavelengths , of any wave .
It &apos;s a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelengths go down . The wavelength goes up , the frequency goes down . So we have a wave here — there it is , this is interesting — as the amplitude goes up , the waves go up , the amplitude goes down , the waves go away .
Right ? This is simple physics .
You all know this from the third grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you about physics — third-grade physics — but they should have — and I wish they had — is that if you multiply the frequency by the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
So , to measure the speed of sound , all you need to know is frequency . It &apos;s simple .
I have a frequency measure here .
Impose it on a third one . It &apos;s a La , more or less .
Now I know the frequency .
It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I &apos;m now measuring the wavelength .
All I need is add another signal , this signal down here is me talking , right ?
Every time I speak , you see it on the screen .
Now I &apos;m going to put it here , and as I get further from the source , notice the spiral .
The sinuous movement . We &apos;re going through various nodes of the survey , and we &apos;re going to get rid of it this way .
For the physicists among you , I hear you &apos;re raising your eyes up to the sky , but take your patience . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I have to do is measure the distance from here , an entire wave , up to here .
From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
So , by putting a meter here , I &apos;m going to step back here .
I moved from here to here about 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here to here , 20 centimeters .
Okay , back to Mr. Elmo .
Let &apos;s say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s calculate how much it does .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 per 0.2 is 352 meters per second .
If you look at the textbooks , the speed is 343 .
But here with some slippery material and some slicky stuff — we were able to measure the speed of sound with a proximation — not bad . Very good .
And that leads to what I wanted to say .
Let &apos;s go back to this picture of a million years ago .
It was 1971 , there was the Vietnam War , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I study physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
I &apos;m coming home , half-course vacation . There &apos;s a riot on campus .
There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , we ended up with Elmo . Sorry .
There &apos;s a riot on campus , and the police are following me , right ?
I &apos;m walking around the campus . The police comes in and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Get out a rifle . And &quot; &quot; buum &quot; &quot; !
A tear the size of a Pepsi can grab my head . Woosh !
I &apos;m breathing a gas mat , and I can &apos;t breathe anymore .
The policeman follows me with a rifle .
He wants to hit me on his head !
And I say , &quot; &quot; I have to run away from here ! &quot; &quot; I run through the fastest campus I can . I walk into the Hayes Hall .
It &apos;s one of those buildings with the bell tower .
The policeman is following me .
He follows me to the first floor , then the second floor , then to the third floor .
He follows me in this room .
It &apos;s the entrance of the bell tower .
I close the door behind me and I start going up , beyond this place where there &apos;s a pendulum swinging .
And I think , right , the square root of the length is proportional to the time . ( Laughter ) I keep going , I take a step back .
I come to this place where a loser jumps .
There &apos;s a clock , watch , watch , watch , watch .
Time is going back because they &apos;re inside .
I &apos;m thinking about the Lorenz contraction and Einstein &apos;s relativity .
I keep going up , and I get to this place , right at the bottom , where you go up with a timber scale .
I come over and I find a dome .
A cousin , one of those 10 feet tall .
I look out and I see the policemen stopping the students on their head , and they shoot tears and I look at the students pulling bricks .
And I wonder , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; And then I get to mind what my English professor told me in high school .
And that is that when you merge the bells , you make encryptions .
So I take the pigeon &apos;s excrement out of one of the bells and I look .
I wonder , why am I here ? So now I want to tell you what words were engraved in the Hayes Hall Tower bells : &quot; &quot; The truth is one .
In this light , they can be science and religion here to caste for the constant evolution of humankind , from the darkness to light , from closing to openness of minds , from prejudice to tolerance .
It &apos;s the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
And while I was on the verge , breaking in my pockets , I found that I didn &apos;t have keys .
In fact , I could see them from the window , on the dining room table , where I &apos;d left them .
I went around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were all closed .
I thought I &apos;d call a manufacturer , at least I had a cell phone , but at midnight , it would take a while before he got there , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t go home to Jeff and stay for the night because the next morning I had a flight to Europe and I needed the passport and the suitcase .
It would have cost a lot , but probably not more than a manufacturer in the middle of the night , so I thought , given the circumstances , I would have gone there .
I have a neuroscientist training , and I know how the brain works when it &apos;s under stress .
It releases cortisol , which increases heart rate , regulates adrenaline levels and anneys reasoning .
So the next morning , when I woke up after too little sleep , worried about the hole in the window , with a mental note that I had to call the veil and the cold temperature and the meetings I had in Europe and with all that cracks in the brain , my mind was annebated , but I didn &apos;t know it was , because the mind was annebated .
( Laughter ) And only when I got to the check-in airport , I found I didn &apos;t have the passport . ( Laughter )
So , I ran home , with snow and ice , 40 minutes , took my passport and went back to the airport , and I arrived just in time , but they had given my place to somebody else , so I found myself in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in an unreclinable seat , on an eight-hour flight .
I had a lot of time to think in those eight hours and without sleep .
( Laughter ) I started asking myself , are there things that I can do , methods that I can apply , that prevent bad things happening ?
Or at least , if bad things happen , to minimize the possibility of becoming a total catastrophe .
So , I started thinking about it , but the idea didn &apos;t become clear to me until a month later .
I was at dinner with my colleague , the Nobel Prize Danny Kahneman and a little embarrassed to tell him about when I broke the window , and I forgot the passport , and Danny told me that he was practicing something called the after-anticipated senn .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he took from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written a few years earlier , which is also called the pre-mortem .
We all know what a post-mortem is .
When disaster happens , experts come in and try to figure out what happened , right ?
Well , according to Danny , in pre-mortem , you &apos;re looking forward and trying to figure out what might go wrong , and then you &apos;re trying to figure out what you can do to avoid these things happening , or to minimize the damage .
So , what I want to talk to you about today is some of the things that we can do in pre-mortem .
Some are obvious , some are not so obvious .
I &apos;m going to start with those obvious ones .
In your home , you assign a place to the things that are easily lost .
Now , it sounds good , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science supporting it , based on how our spatial memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , which has evolved over tens of thousands of years , which keeps track of the place of important things — where the well is , where you can find the fish , where the fruit trees are , where the friendly and the enemies live .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in the polymer pockets , it gets bigger .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows the squirrels to find the peanuts .
If you were to ask , it was an experiment where you took off the squirrels the sense of smell , but they found food the same .
They didn &apos;t use the smell , they used the hippocampus , that mechanism in the brain that was well developed to find things .
It &apos;s very good for the things that don &apos;t move very well , not so good for the things that move .
That &apos;s why we lose the keys of the car , the glasses and the passports .
So , at home , you assign a place for the keys , a kangaroo next to the door , or a mobile phone .
For the passport , a particular drawer .
For glasses , a particular table .
If you assign a place and you &apos;re meticolis , things will always be there when you look for them .
What about the journey ?
With the phone you photograph credit cards , the driver , the passport , send them to an email so they &apos;re on the web .
If these things are lost or stolen , it &apos;s easier to do than new things .
Now , these are pretty obvious things .
Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
Corstisol is toxic and causes the annebition of the mind .
So , part of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not the best of shape and you should have a method .
And maybe there &apos;s no more striking situation than when you &apos;re faced with a medical decision to make .
And at some point , all of us are in the situation where we have to make an important decision , about our future health care , or those of us care or help them decide .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a particular medical condition .
But it &apos;s an example for all sorts of medical decisions and also for financial and social decisions and for every decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of facts .
Suppose we go to the doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I &apos;ve just had the test results , his cholesterol is a little high . &quot;
We all know that high cholesterol is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease , heart disease , stroke .
The number needs subjects to deal with .
And this , the NNT , what is it ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to hire a drug or do surgery or other medical procedures before a subject benefits .
And you think , what kind of statistic is this ?
It should be one .
The doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe me anything if it doesn &apos;t help me .
But in fact , medicine doesn &apos;t work that way .
And it &apos;s not because of doctors . If it &apos;s somebody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s scientists like me .
We didn &apos;t understand the basic mechanism enough .
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs only work on 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number you need to treat for the most common statina , what do you think it is ?
How many people have to take it before it &apos;s useful ?
300 .
This is according to the study of the researchers , Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband , confirmed independently by Bloomberg.com.
I also studied numbers .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they prevent a heart attack , a stroke or other unpleasant events .
You probably think , OK , one in 300 chance to lower your cholesterol .
&quot; &quot; Dr. , why not ? I &apos;ll give it the same . &quot; &quot; But at this point you should ask another statistic , which is , &quot; &quot; tell me about side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
For this particular drug , the side effects occur on five percent of the patients .
You &apos;re 15 times at risk that the drug is going to hurt you more than it can help you .
Now , I &apos;m not telling you to take the drug or not .
I just say you should have this conversation with the doctor .
Medical ethics requires that , it &apos;s part of the principle of informed consent .
You have the right to have access to this kind of information , to begin to say whether you want to run the risk or not .
Now you might think I &apos;ve invented the number to create effect , but in fact , this number is quite typical .
For the most common operation on men over 50 years , prostate removal for cancer , the number you need is 49 .
That &apos;s right . 49 operations are done before one person benefits .
And the side effects in this case are 50 percent of the patients .
They include : impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
And if you &apos;re lucky and you &apos;re one of the 50 who has them , they only last for a year or two .
So the idea of pre-mortem is to think ahead of the questions that you might ask , that they &apos;re going to keep the conversation going .
You don &apos;t want to create this on the moment .
And you want to think of things like quality of life .
Because often , you have the choice : Do I want to live less but without pain , or live more , but maybe with a lot of pain towards the end ?
That &apos;s what you have to talk about and think now , with family and loved ones .
You might change your mind right now , but at least , you &apos;ve practiced with this kind of thinking .
If you run a predator , the digestive system doesn &apos;t need , you don &apos;t need the libid or the immune system , because if the body consumed metabolism for these things , and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion lunch , and then none of those things will drive .
Unfortunately , one of the things that disappears when you &apos;re under stress is the logical and rational thought , as Danny Kahneman demonstrated and his colleagues .
We need to teach ourselves to think ahead of these kinds of situations .
I think the important point is to recognize that we &apos;re not perfect .
Every now and then we all fail .
The idea is to think ahead of what failures might be , to have a method that helps minimize damage or prevent bad things happening .
Going back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I came back from the journey , I put a blackboard with openness next to the door , with the key to the door , an easy combination to remember .
And I have to admit , I still have lots of mail that I have to put together and stacks of email that I still have to read .
So I &apos;m not totally organized , but I see organization as a gradual process and I &apos;m getting there .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning !
Are you all surprised ?
I no longer have a sign with my name , but I wanted to ask you — did anyone write their name in Arabic on the sign ?
Right ? All right , there &apos;s no problem .
Once upon a time , not long ago , I was at a restaurant with a friend and we were ordering .
I looked at the waiter and I asked him , &quot; Do you have a menu ? ( Arabic )
He looked me wrong , thinking I felt bad .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; So I repeated , &quot; &quot; The menu , please . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know how you say it ? &quot; &quot; Of course it does . &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; French pronunciation is correct ?
The waiter said , &quot; Come here ! Give this one ! &quot;
It seemed disgusted to talk to me , as though he himself and himself thought , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t even look at it if it was the last girl in the world ! &quot;
But what does it mean to say &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
At a young Libanese , it took two words to tag a girl like a simpletball and an ignorant .
But how does it speak like this ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It made me angry .
He had really hurt me !
Don &apos;t I have the right to speak my language in my country ?
But what country do we live in ?
How did we get here ?
While we are here , there are many people like me who at some point in their life , without wanting to , leave everything that happened to them in the past , just to say that they are modern and civilized .
Should I even forget all my culture , my thoughts , my intellect and my memories ?
The stories of when we were little are the best memories we have of war !
Do I have to forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform me ?
To become one of them ?
What &apos;s the point ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand that waiter .
I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty he had judged me .
The Arab language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language that &apos;s suitable to science , research , it &apos;s not a language that we &apos;re used to in universities or in jobs , a language that we rely on to lead cutting-edge research projects , and it &apos;s not even a language we use at the airport .
If we tried it , they would make us stay in pants .
So where can we use it ? It &apos;s a question that we could all ask ourselves !
You want us to use Arabic . Where can we use it ?
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another , more important one , that we should consider .
Arabic is our native speaker .
Research has shown that , in order to master other languages , you have to master your own .
Playing your tongue is a prerequisite to express itself creatively in another .
But how ?
Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he approached writing , was using Arabic .
All of his ideas , his imagination and his philosophy were inspired by this child , in the village where he grew up , breathing certain odors , feeling certain voices , and thinking about certain things .
So when he started writing in English , he already had a big bath .
Even when he wrote in English , when we read his work in English , we breathe the the same smell , we feel the same feeling .
We can imagine it &apos;s him writing in English , the same kid coming from mountains , from a village in Lebanon Mont .
This is an example that you can &apos;t beat .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that to eradicate a nation , the only way to get a nation to get rid of it is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that all developed societies are aware of .
Tedeschi , French , Japanese , Chinese : they &apos;re all aware of it .
That &apos;s why there are laws for language conservation .
They do something sacred about it .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
Do we know more about them ?
All right , we don &apos;t come from the developed world , these innovative visions from us have not yet arrived , and we &apos;d like to share with the civilized world .
Countries that used to be in the same situation , but they decided to engage in development , they devote to research and they peer with those countries : countries like Turkey , Malaysia and others , have brought their tongue into the development race , protected it as a diamond .
They kept it tightly .
Because if you buy a Turkish product , or another country , and the label is not in Turkish , then it &apos;s not a local product .
You would never believe it &apos;s a local product .
They would come back to being consumers , simple naive consumers , as we are most of the time .
So to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Liberty , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; what do you think ?
Sounds familiar , right ?
Regardless of who , how and why .
A language doesn &apos;t just need to communicate , it &apos;s not just words .
Language represents specific stages of our life , terminology tied to our emotions .
So when I say &quot; &quot; Liberty , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each of us creates a different mental image , which connects specific feelings of a specific day , at a specific moment in history .
Language is not one , two or three words or letters combined .
It &apos;s an inner idea tied to our thinking , how we see others and how others see us .
What is our intellect ?
How do I know if someone understood me or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Liberty , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your child asks you , &quot; Dad , did you have when people were walking around saying &quot; freedom &quot; &quot; ?
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see anything weird about it , maybe it &apos;s better for me to go away and stop talking empty .
The point is that these expressions remind us of something specific .
I have a francofona friend who married a French man .
I once asked her how she was going .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s fine , but once I spent all night wondering and trying to translate the meaning of the word &quot; &quot; toqborne &quot; &quot; because he understood it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That poor woman had used &quot; &quot; toqborne &quot; &quot; without thinking about it , and then he spent the night trying to explain it .
He didn &apos;t understand , &quot; &quot; How do you get so cruel ?
Will she not want to commit suicide ?
&apos;Oxpelliscimi ? &apos; ( In English ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just an example .
But we realized that he can &apos;t use that word with his husband , because he doesn &apos;t understand it , and he &apos;s not wrong ; he has a different way of thinking .
My friend told me , &quot; &quot; Listen Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate it to him , because it could prove what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; And the poor woman tried to translate a song that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve extended my hand and I stole you ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And here they start the problems : &quot; And because you belong to them , I dropped my hand . &quot; ( Laughter )
Just pull it off , if you can .
( Applause ) And what did we do to protect the Arab language ?
We turned it into a civil society problem , and we launched a campaign to safeguard Arabic .
And yet many people said to me , &quot; &quot; What do you care about ?
Never go out and have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arab conservation campaign uses a slogan that says , &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but I &apos;m responding to the west . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because otherwise we would be misunderstood .
And when someone talks like this to me , it makes me hate Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that enables our dreams , aspirations and everyday life .
It &apos;s a way that goes like us and you think like us .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re responding to the west , &quot; &quot; he did a center .
It &apos;s very simple , but at the same time creative and compelling .
Then after that , we launched another campaign with letters on the ground .
You saw one example out there , the image of a letter surrounded by a yellow and white ribbon with the written &quot; Don &apos;t kill your tongue ! &quot;
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
It &apos;s something we shouldn &apos;t really do .
If we kill our language , we should find another identity .
We should find another life .
We should start again .
It would go far beyond losing the opportunity to become modern and civilized .
We also published pictures of boys and girls with an Arab letter .
I have millions of boys and girls who are cool .
We &apos;re really cool !
And everyone who says to me , &quot; &quot; Ah ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve adopted the word &quot; &quot; cool . &quot; &quot; Let me protest , until they give me a better word and respects reality better .
I &apos;ll keep saying , &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; I would never say , &quot; &quot; I go to the world wide web ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t sound good ! Let &apos;s not turn around .
But to get to this point , you have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t afford any bigger than us or that they think they have some power on us when it comes to language , to control us or to think about them and to feel what they want .
The key is creativity .
Maybe we can &apos;t go into space , build a rocket and so forth , but we can always be creative .
At this very moment , each of you is a creative project .
What we need to pursue is creativity in our native speaker .
Let &apos;s start right now .
We write a novel or we produce a courtytrage .
It could take a single novel to make us global again .
to bring the Arab language back to the top of the ranks .
So it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; the solution is ecology !
But we need to be aware of it and be convinced that the solution exists that we need to be part of this solution .
To conclude , what can you do today ?
Let &apos;s see , tweet , who &apos;s tweeting ?
Please ask you , I &apos;m asking you in your knees , even though my time is already down , they &apos;re okay Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with figures of figures !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! Not a language .
You would enter a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from a place like this and boil back .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
But we can do many more .
We &apos;re not here to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to point out the reflectors about the need to preserve this language .
Let me tell you a secret .
A baby recognizes his father through his tongue .
When my daughter &apos;s born , I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Honey , this is your father . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say to her , &quot; &quot; Honey , this is your dad . &quot; &quot; And at the supermarket , I promise to my daughter Noor who says , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Come on , Maman , &quot; &quot; hope nobody &apos;s heard that .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this form of cultural humiliation . ( Applause )
Sustainability is the thing , where and how it &apos;s been taken .
Who and why they are what matters to me .
I want to know the people behind my culinary choices .
I want to know my impact on them .
And I want to know their impact on me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on what they find in the water for their livelihood .
Understanding all of this allows us to shift our perception of seawater products from looking at a commodity to consider them an opportunity to fix our ecosystem .
It also allows us to celebrate the products of the sea that we are so lucky that we can eat .
How do we call this ?
We could call it regenerative fish .
If sustainability is the ability to resist and maintain , regenerativity is the ability to fill and progress .
Rgenerative fish supports a dynamic system in evolution and recognizes our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we can do an effort to reclaim the ocean and encourage its resistance .
It &apos;s a way that gives hope , it &apos;s a more human way , it &apos;s a more useful way to understand our environment .
Depliant informational — a standard tool for many in the world of marine protection — are very comfortable , a wonderful tool .
Green , yellow and red list species .
The association is very simple : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , on the yellow , think about it twice .
But to me , it &apos;s not enough to eat just what &apos;s in the green list .
We can &apos;t support it without measuring our success in actually changing the fate of species in yellow and red lists .
What if we really ate just from the green list ?
There &apos;s the bluefin tuna fished with the tuna — it comes from sustainable reserves .
Part with the rope , there &apos;s no bycatch .
Very good for fishermen . A lot of money . You incentivize local economies .
But it &apos;s a sea lion . It &apos;s a fundamental predator .
What is the context of this meal ?
Do I sit at the restaurant with a half-kilogram transit ?
Do I do it three times a week ?
I &apos;m probably still on the green list , but I &apos;m not favor myself , to you , or at least to the ocean .
The point is that you have to have a context , a measure unit for our actions in this field .
Example : I heard red wine is wonderful for health — antioxidants and minerals — great for heart .
Fantastic ! I love red wine !
I &apos;ll start to drink a lot . I &apos;ll be in perfect health .
So how many bottles do I have to drink before somebody tells me I have a problem ?
Ladies , we have a protein problem .
We &apos;ve lost that judgment capacity when it comes to our food , and we &apos;re paying the price for it .
The problem is that we &apos;re hiding that price under the waves .
We &apos;re hiding that price behind social acceptance of expanding wetlands .
And we &apos;re hiding that price behind monstrous profits .
The first feature of this idea of regenerative fish is that it really holds our needs into account .
The regenerative fish may be best represented not by the Squalo , by Flipper , or Capitan Findus , but perhaps from the ninth of Valfruit advertising .
The vegetables : they can still save the oceans .
Sylvia says the blue is the new green .
I &apos;d like to respectfully suggest that green is the new blue .
We have to keep eating as much fish as we can , if we really have to .
But we also have to eat it with a ton of vegetables .
The best part of the regenerative fish is that it gets into its shell with a little bit of Tabasco and a little bit of limone .
You get in portions of two rooftilapia that occurs in Digion and pangratted mostat , accompanied by a resin with quinoa and nuts and grilled broccoli , all beautifully delicate , sweet , frozen and sinked outward with just a tip of backpacking .
Whooo !
It &apos;s easy to sell it .
And the best part is that all of these ingredients are available for every family in the supermarket behind the house .
Jamie Oliver is doing a campaign to save America from the way they eat .
Sylvia is fighting to save the oceans from the way we eat .
You see the pattern .
Forget nuclear holocaust ; we have to worry about pools .
We sacred the land and then use the food that we collected to make us sick in more than one way .
I think all the way we eat is wrong .
And I also think it &apos;s time for us to change our expectations of food .
Sustainability is complicated , but dinner is a reality that we all understand pretty well .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s a lot of movement recently to make our food green green .
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are driving Delicious Revolution passionately .
But vegetables often represent a way for us to transcend our responsibilities as consumers .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with enough in the dish .
There are eco-compatible shrimp .
We can do it ; we have technology .
But there &apos;s never going to be a one-on-one , one-size-to-eat buffet of eco-compatible shrimp .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
The healthy food for the heart is an important part of the regenerative fish .
While we &apos;re trying to preserve marine populations in decline , the media recommend that we increase our consumption of fish .
Studies say that tens of thousands of grandmothers , grandparents , mothers and fathers in the United States could earn many years of life if we included more fish .
It &apos;s a result that I don &apos;t want to let go .
But it &apos;s not just fish .
It &apos;s also the way we look at our dishes .
As a chef , I realize that the easiest thing to do is to reduce the size of ports .
A couple of things happened .
I made more money .
The clients started ordering antibodies and salads because they knew they weren &apos;t just going to be satiated with the main plate .
People started spending more time at the table , spending more time together during the meals .
People basically got more than what they wanted to get , even though they got less proteins .
They got more calories in the course of a diversified meal .
They &apos;re healthier . I make more money .
It &apos;s fantastic .
Environmental conservation is served with every plate , but it &apos;s served with a huge amount of protection for human interests at the same time .
Another thing we did was to diversify the species that were served : small , blue fish , tears , tears , sardine , became common .
Mollusses , coaches , oysters , vonges , tilapia , saline , all very widespread species .
We were directing gazes towards greater resistance , towards more sustainable options .
That &apos;s what we need to encourage .
This is what the green list says .
But it &apos;s also the way we can begin to regenerate our ecosystem .
But what happens to great predators ? What about fashionable species ? And that tuna in the green list that I talked about earlier ?
Well , if you have to , I have a recipe for you .
It works pretty much the same way for every big ocean fish , there it is .
Take your half-kilogram transit .
Take a knife and cut it in four parts .
Put them on four plates .
You fill those four dishes of vegetables , stack the best bottle of wine you have , turn on the candles and celebrate that fish .
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat it .
Invest friends and neighbors and do it every year , maybe .
I look a lot like food .
I expect health , joy , family , community .
I expect to produce ingredients , prepare dishes and consume meals are all part of the community of human interests .
I was lucky enough to have a great chef like father .
He made me realize very early on that privilege is to be able to eat .
I remember the food of my childhood very well .
There were reasonable portions of proteins , accompanied by large amounts of vegetables and small doses of starch , usually rice .
I still eat in the same way .
I feel bad when I enter a steakhouse .
I get cold sweats .
It &apos;s like a protein sock .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But of all the bad news that you &apos;ll hear and that you &apos;ve already heard about the ocean conditions , I take the unfortunate burden of having to give you perhaps the worst of all , and that is that your mother always was right .
You eat vegetables .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
What do you look for in a meal ?
For health , I look for complete ingredients that are good for my body .
For joy , I look for butter and salt or other exotic things that take away from my food the flavor of penalty .
For my family , I look for recipes that honor my personal stories .
For the community , we said it from the beginning .
You can &apos;t avoid the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
So try to know the best possible possible what this impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our global bank .
But it &apos;s more than just a resource deposit ; it &apos;s also the global geography of that sharing that we call food .
If we all just take what we need , we can start to share the rest , we can start to celebrate , we can start to regenerate .
We have to taste vegetables .
We have to taste smaller portions of fish .
And we have to save dinner .
Thank you .

Good morning , I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world that builds buildings with paper , like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using cardboard tubes .
1986 , very , very long before people started talking about environmental and environmental issues , I started testing cardboard tube to be able to use it as a construction facility .
It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for buildings , but this is much more resistant than I expected , and it &apos;s also impermeable . Also , being an industrial material , it &apos;s also resistant to fire .
Then I built a temporary structure in 1990 .
This is the first temporary building of paper .
It &apos;s made of 330 pipes , five inches of diameter , only 12 pipes in a diameter of 120 centimeters .
As you see in the picture , there &apos;s the toilet inside .
If you &apos;ve finished toilet paper , you can break it off the wall . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s very useful .
In 2000 , there was a great exhibition in Germany .
I was asked to design the building , because the theme of exhibition was environmental issues .
So I was chosen to build the pavilion with cardboard pipes , recycled paper .
The goal of my creation was not to complete it .
My goal was to demolish the building , because all countries make lots of pavilions , but after six months , a lot of industrial waste is created , so my building had to be reused or recycled .
In the end , the building was recycled .
This was the goal of my project .
Then , I was fortunate enough to win the competition for building the second Pompidou Center in France in Metz City .
Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to take my students to Paris to build an office at the top of the Pompidou Center in Paris all alone .
We brought cardboard tubes and wooden joints to complete this 35-foot office .
We stayed there for six years without paying the rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you ! I had a big problem .
We were part of the exhibition , so even though my friends wanted to see me , they should have paid the ticket .
That was the problem .
And then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
Now it &apos;s a very popular museum , and I &apos;ve created a great monument for the government .
But I was deeply disappointed by my architect profession , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society . We work for the privileged , the rich , the governments , the developers .
They have money and power .
These are things that are invisible .
So they take us to visualize their power and their money by creating imponent architectures .
This is our profession , even historically , is the same , even now we &apos;re doing the same .
So I was very disappointed not to work for society , even though there are many people who lose their home because of natural disasters .
But I have to say that they &apos;re no longer natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes never kill people , it &apos;s the collapse of buildings that kill people .
This is the responsibility of architects .
Then people need temporary housing , but there are no architects working on it because we &apos;re too busy working for the privileged .
So I thought that even as architects , you can be involved in rebuilding temporary housing .
We can make them better .
That &apos;s why I started working in disastrous areas .
In 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda in Africa .
Two tribes , the Hutu and the Tutsi , fought .
More than two million people have become refugee .
But I was surprised to see the refugee camp organized by the United Nations .
They &apos;re so poor , people frozen under the covers in the rains season . In the refugee built by the United Nations , they only provided a plastic canvas , and the refugees had to cut the trees .
But more than two million people cut trees .
It &apos;s turned into a huge deforestation and an environmental problem .
That &apos;s why they started providing tubes , &#91; unclear &#93; , boats .
Very expensive , money thrown , and they cut other trees .
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using cardboard tubes because they &apos;re cheap and resilient , but my budget is only 50 dollars per unit .
We built 50 units to do a humidity resistance test and termites and so on .
Then , a year later , in 1995 in Kobe in Japan , there was a huge earthquake .
They &apos;ve been killed more than 7,000 people , and in cities like this Nagata district , the whole city is burned in a fire after the heat .
I also found that many Vietnamese refugees gathered in a Catholic church — the building was completely destroyed .
So I went there and proposed to the prizes , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church with cardboard pipes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , are you mad ?
After a fire , what do you offer me ? &quot; &quot; He never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t resign .
I started traveling back and forth to Kobe , and I met the Vietnamese community .
They lived this way under very poor plastic canvas in the park .
So I proposed to rebuild . I raised money .
I created a cardboard shelter for them , and I made it easy to build for the students and even easy to demolish , I used beer boxes for the foundation .
I asked the manufacturer of the Kirin beer , because at the time , the manufacturer of the Asashi beer was making red beer boxes , which doesn &apos;t fit into the color of cardboard pipes .
The color match is very important .
I still remember waiting for beer in plastic boxes , but they got empty . ( Laughter ) I remember being disappointed .
During the summer with my students , we built over 50 shelters .
At the end of the priest , he finally trusted me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you raise money on your own , you take your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; We spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
He should have stood for three years , and he actually stood for 10 years because people liked it .
Then , in Taiwan , there was a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate the church , so we dismantled it , we sent it to make it volunteer .
It &apos;s in Taiwan yet as a permanent church .
This building became a permanent building .
So I wonder , what distinguishes a permanent building from a temporary building ?
Even a paper building can be permanent until people like it .
Even a concrete building can be temporary if it &apos;s done to make money .
In 1999 , in Turkey , the great earthquake , I went there to use local materials to build a shelter .
2001 , Western India , I also built a bomb shelter there .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the earthquake of Sumatra and the tsunami , I reconstructed the villages of Islamic fishermen .
And in 2008 , in Chengdu , in the Sichuan area in China , more than 70,000 people were killed , and in particular many schools were destroyed because of the corruption between authorities and the contractors .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with Chinese students .
In a month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
It &apos;s still in use , even after the recent earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in The Aquila , Italy there was also a big earthquake there .
This is a very interesting picture : the former British Prime Minister Berlusconi and the former , former Japanese Prime Minister Mr Asa — you know , we have to change prime minister every year .
They &apos;re nice motorcycles to support my model .
I proposed a great reconstruction , a temporary concert hall , because the Aquila is very famous for music , and all the concert halls were destroyed , so the musicians moved .
So I proposed to the mayor to rebuild a temporary auditorium .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you put money on it , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was lucky .
Berlusconi brought G8 , and our former prime minister came , and they helped us raise money . I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly . So I went to Santo Domingo , the next country , and I drove six hours to get to Haiti with the students of Domingo , to build 50 shelters with local cardboard tubes .
This is what happened in Japan two years ago in North Japan .
After the earthquake and tusher , people had been evacuated in a great hall , a gym .
But look here . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
So we went there to build a divide with all the volunteer students , with cardboard pipes , a simple shelter from a pipe structure and tents .
However , some authorities didn &apos;t want us to intervene , because according to them , they become difficult to control .
But you really need to do that .
They don &apos;t have enough planning areas to build regional housing at a plan like this .
Look at this . The government also makes temporary housing so poor , so dense and so chaotic because there &apos;s no room , there &apos;s no water loss , so I thought we had to make buildings more plans because there &apos;s no land and it &apos;s not even very convenient .
So I proposed it to the mayor while I was doing the dividend .
Finally , I met this very nice mayor in the village in Onagawa in Miyagi .
He asked me to build a three-story housing on a baseball field .
I used shipping containers , and the students also helped us do housing to make them comfortable . I went back into the government budget and using exactly the same area , but in a much more convenient way .
A lot of people want to stay here forever .
I &apos;m happy to know that .
I &apos;m now working in New Zealand in Christchurch .
About a dozen days before the earthquake in Japan , they also had an earthquake , and many Japanese students were killed , and the most important cathedral in the city , Christchurch &apos;s symbol , was completely destroyed .
I was asked to rebuild a temporary cathedral .
This is in construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that people love .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What happens in this child &apos;s mind ?
If you had asked this question 30 years ago , many , including psychologists , would have said that this child was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t see with the eyes of another person or understand the causes and effect mechanisms .
In the last 20 years , behavioral science has shocked this picture .
Somehow , we believe that the thoughts of this child are like the thoughts of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you an example .
One thing that might think of this child , which might pass it through his mind , is to try to figure out what &apos;s going on in another child &apos;s mind .
After all , one of the hardest things for us is to understand what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the hardest thing about all is understanding that what they think and feel other people is not really what we think and feel about ourselves .
Anyone who has followed policy can report how hard it is for some people to get there .
We wanted to know whether babies and children can understand this profound thing about other people .
The question is , how can we ask them ?
Babies , after all , don &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what they think , what you &apos;re going to get is a conscious monologue that &apos;s stuck on bridges and birthdays and things like that .
So how do you ask the question ?
It turns out the secret is broccoli .
What we did — Betty Rapacholi , a student of mine , and I — gave children two food plates : a plate of simple broccoli and a plate of delicious cookies in the form of fish .
All the kids , even in Berkley , love cookies and hire broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was he tasted some food from every dish .
And he &apos;d pretend to love him or to hire him .
Half the time , it was as if they liked biscuits and didn &apos;t like broccoli — like a child or any normal person .
But the other half of the time , he took some broccoli and he said , &quot; &quot; Mmmm , broccoli .
I &apos;d taste broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then he &apos;d take some biscuits , and he &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Puah , cookie .
I tasted the biscuits . Puah . &quot; &quot; He did as if he wanted the exact opposite of what kids want .
We did it with 15-month-old kids and 18 months .
And then he would just put his hand out and say , &quot; Do you give me some ? &quot;
The question is , what will the baby give her , what does she like to him or what she likes ?
And the odd thing is that 18-month-old babies , who barely walk and talk , give her cookies if they like cookies , but give her broccoli if they like broccoli .
On the other hand , 15-month-old babies were staring at it long if they were acting like broccoli , as if they couldn &apos;t figure out why .
But after staring at her for a long time , they gave her the cookies , what they thought would like everyone .
There are two really remarkable things .
The first is that these 18-month-old children have already discovered this very profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same things .
And also , they felt they had to do something to help others get what they want .
And even more remarkable , the fact that a 15-month-old child does not suggest that these 18-month children have learned this profound fact about human nature in those three months from 15 to 18 months .
So kids know more and learn more about what we can think .
And this is just one of the hundreds and hundreds of studies done in the last 20 years that demonstrate this .
The question you might ask is , why do children learn so much ?
And how do they learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at children in a superficial way , they look pretty useless .
And in fact , in some ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put time and energy just to keep them alive .
But when you look at evolution looking for an answer to this mystery of why we spend so much time taking care of useless children , it turns out that actually an answer exists .
When you look at a lot , a lot of different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupial animals like canoes and vombatids , you find that there &apos;s a relationship between the length of childhood of a species and the size of their brain compared to the body and how smart and adaptable they are .
And for this idea , these birds are representative .
On the one hand , there &apos;s a rope from New Caledonia .
And the ropes and other ropes , ropes , cornacks and so on , are incredibly clever birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some cases .
And this is a bird on the cover of Science that learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our domestic chicken friends .
And the chickens , the ducks , the geese and the tacks are essentially very stupid .
So they &apos;re very , very good at picking seeds , and they &apos;re not very good at doing anything else .
And it turns out that the puppets , the little boys in the New Caledonia Court , are birds .
They depend on their mom who drops their worms into the open beak for two years , which represents a very long time in a bird &apos;s life .
Whereas chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason that chords end up on the cover of Science and chickens end up in the soup .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
What kind of explanation could we have ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem to be suitable to do one thing very well .
So it seems that they &apos;re absolutely suitable to catch the feed in one environment .
Other creatures , like ropes , are not very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning the laws that govern different environments .
And of course , we humans are at the end of the distribution curve like ropes .
We have bigger brains in proportion to the bodies much larger than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more adaptable , we can learn more , we live in more different environments , we migrated around the world and we &apos;ve also gone into space .
And our babies and children depend on us for much longer than the young of any other species .
My son is 23 years old .
( Laughter ) And at least up to 23 years , we still lay worms in those little open mouths .
Why do we see this correlation ?
One idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is extremely powerful , great strategy to move forward in the world , but it has a big disadvantage .
And the big disadvantage is that , until you end all that learning , you &apos;re impotent .
So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon that charges you when you say to yourself , &quot; A catapult or maybe a tosses might work . What &apos;s the best solution ? &quot;
You want to know everything before the mastodon shows up .
And the way evolution seems to have solved the problem is with a kind of task division .
The idea is that in this first time when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all of these things that we &apos;ve learned from infants and children and put them as a function to go out there in the world .
One way of seeing it is that babies and children are like division and development of the human species .
It &apos;s the protected scientists who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we are production and marketing .
We have to take all of these ideas that we &apos;ve learned as a child and implement them .
Another way of looking at it is , instead of thinking about babies and children as defective adults , we should look at them as humans of the same species in a different phase of development — like with bruchi and butterflies — except that they are actually the wonderful butterflies that go around in the garden and explore , and we are the bruchi that plain forward along the narrow path of adults .
If this is true , if these children are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story tells us that children are made to learn , they &apos;re made for this — we might expect them to have powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the children &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful computer capable of learning on earth .
But real computers are getting better .
And there was recently a revolution in our understanding of machine learning .
And it depends on all the ideas of this man , the Revering Thomas Bayes , a statistic and mathematician in the 18th century .
And basically what Bayes did was he provided a mathematical method that uses probability theory to characterize and describe the way scientists discover the world .
What scientists do is they start with a hypothesis that they think is a starting point .
They test it .
The evidence makes them change their assumptions .
Then they test these new hypotheses and so on .
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical tool to do this .
And that mathematics is at the heart of the best machine learning programs we have today .
And a decade ago , I suggested that children could do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on behind those beautiful beaver beekeepers , I think it looks like this .
These are the notes from Revering Bayes .
I think these kids are actually doing complicated calculations with parole probabilities that are coming back to understand how the world works .
Well , it might seem a much harder process to prove .
Because after all , even if you ask adults about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How can children be good at statistic ?
To test this , we used a machine called the Blicket Rilevator .
It &apos;s a box that &apos;s lit up and playing on some things and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done a dozen studies that show how good kids are to learn things about the world .
I &apos;ll just tell you one that we did with Tumar Kushner , a student of mine .
If I showed you this detector , it &apos;s likely that you would think , to begin with , that the way to do it would be to put a block on top of the detector .
But actually , this detector works a little bit strange .
Because if you pass a block at the top of the detector , something you would never have thought of starting with , actually , the detector will be twice as big as three .
Whereas if you do the same thing , put the block on the detector , it &apos;s only going to happen twice on six .
So the most unlikely hypothesis actually has more evidence for it .
It seems that shaking the object is a more effective strategy than the other .
We just did this : we gave a four-year-old this series of evidence , and we asked him to make it work .
And in fact , the four-year-old has used the evidence to agitate the object on the detector .
There are two very interesting things about this .
The first , again , remember , these are four-year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these pretty complicated calculations that will give them a measure of the probability conditioning .
And the other interesting thing is that they use the evidence to get an idea , to get to a world hypothesis , which seems to be very unlikely .
And in the studies that we &apos;ve just done in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve shown that four-year-olds are better at coming up with an improbable hypothesis than adults that we do exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , children use statistic to discover the world , but after all , scientists do experiments , and we wanted to see if kids do experiments .
When kids do experiments , we call it &quot; &quot; try everything , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And recently there was a series of interesting studies that showed that play is really a kind of experimental research program .
This is one from the lab in Cristine Legare .
What Christine did was use the Blicket Rilevator .
And what he did was he showed the kids that the yellow made him go and the red didn &apos;t , and then he showed an anomaly .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this kid will experience five hypotheses within two minutes .
( Video ) Child : What do you think about this ?
Like on the other side .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , his first hypothesis was contradicted .
Child : Nothing . ( Laughter ) Child : This is on , and this is not .
AG : Okay , he took out the block of experiments .
Child : What makes it light ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : All scientists recognize that expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
AG : Okay , second hypothesis .
Child : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG : So here &apos;s the next idea .
He told the experimenter to do it , to try to put it in the other place .
It doesn &apos;t even work that way .
Child : Oh , because light is just here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electric current , this one doesn &apos;t have it .
AG : Okay , this is a fourth hypothesis .
Child : You turn on .
So it &apos;s when you put four of them .
So you put four on this to make it light and two on this to make it light .
AG : Okay , this is the fifth guess .
This is a child — it &apos;s a particularly lovely and eloquent child , but what Christine discovered is that it &apos;s actually quite characteristic .
If you look at how kids play , when you ask them to explain something , what they &apos;re actually doing is a series of experiments .
It &apos;s pretty typical of the four-year-old .
Well , what does it mean to be this kind of creature ?
What does it mean to be one of these brilliant butterflies that can experience five hypotheses in two minutes ?
If you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , many of them said that baby babies and baby children are barely conscious if not entirely conscious .
And I think that &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we adults .
Here &apos;s what we know about how consciousness of adults works .
And the attention and consciousness of adults are a little bit like a reflector .
What happens in adults is that if we decide that something is relevant or important , we should be paying attention .
Our consciousness of that thing that we witness becomes extremely vivid and brilliant , and everything else is dark .
And we also know something about how the brain operates this way .
What happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the part that goes out in our brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain a little bit more flexible , more plastic , more adapted to learning , and turns off activity throughout our brain .
So we have a very focused , driven attention from purpose .
If we look at the babies and the young children , we see something very different .
I think baby babies and baby children have more a lantern of consciousness than a reflector of consciousness .
So babies and baby babies are really bad at focusing on one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at recovering a lot of information from a lot of different sources in one time .
If you look inside their brain , you can see that they &apos;re invaded by these neurotransmitters that are very good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the parts that inhibit them are still not there .
So when we say that babies and children are not good at being careful , what we actually mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
They &apos;re not able to get rid of all the interesting things that might mean something to them and just look at what &apos;s important .
It &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies that are designed to learn .
Well , if we want to think about a way to have an idea of consciousness of a child as an adult , I think the best thing to do is to think about cases where we &apos;re in a new situation we &apos;ve never seen before — when we fall in love with somebody , when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem much more full of awareness and experience of all the months spent walking , talking , presuming meetings like zombie and coming home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you drink at the bottom floor , actually simulates the effect of children &apos;s neurotransmitters .
So what does it mean to be a child ?
It &apos;s like having fallen in love in Paris for the first time after drinking three broad expressions .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a fantastic way of being , but it doesn &apos;t usually get you up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s nice to be an adult .
I don &apos;t mean too much about how wonderful children are .
It &apos;s nice to be an adult .
We can do things like chasing shoes and crossing the street alone .
And it makes a lot of effort to make kids think of as adults .
But if what we want to be like these butterflies , having open mindset , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe sometimes we should push adults to start thinking about how babies are .

I &apos;m going to share with you the story of how I became an activist for the fight against HIV / AIDS .
This is the name of my campaign , SING .
In November 2003 , I was invited to participate in the opening of the 4664 Foundation of Nelson Mandela , and that &apos;s his foundation for the fight against HIV / AIDS .
Whereas 4664 is the number of Mandela &apos;s identifications during his prison in Robben Island .
That &apos;s me , with Youssou N&apos; Dour on the stage , having a fun time to die .
The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a world press conference in front of the cell where he was held .
You see the bars in the window .
It was for all an epocal moment .
At that moment Mandela said to the world &apos;s press that a virtual genocide was going on in his country , in that Rainbow Nation of the after apartheid , and he said that a thousand people dying a day , and that the victims in the front lines , the most vulnerable , were women and children .
The impact on me was huge , because I &apos;m a woman and a mother , and I didn &apos;t realize that HIV / AIDS pandemic affected women in such a way .
It was then that I committed to — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; This is a topic that I have to talk about .
I have to give my contribution . &quot; &quot; And since then , I &apos;ve been part of every event of 4664 that I could participate in , giving press conferences , releasing interviews , talking and using my space of musician , with my commitment to Mandela , held by respect to the astonishing , incredible work that he did .
In the world , everyone respects Nelson Mandela . Everybody admires Nelson Mandela .
But are they all aware of what &apos;s happening in South Africa , in its country , the country that has had one of the highest transmission rates of the virus ?
If I went down the street , now , telling people what was going on there , they would all be shocked .
I think I &apos;m very lucky to meet , a couple of years later , Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an activist and an incredible campaigner .
I met him at a 4664 event .
He wore a t-shirt like the one I have now .
This is a tool . It tells you that I am sympathetic with HIV people , living with HIV .
And so , despite the stigma , wearing this t-shirt , I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about it .
It doesn &apos;t have to be a taboo . &quot; &quot; I became a member of the Treatment Action Campaign , and I &apos;m very proud to be part of that beautiful organization .
This is a popular movement , and 80 percent of the members are women , most of which are HIV-positive .
These women work in camps .
And they have the great opportunity to reach people who directly feed the effects of the virus .
They have education programs .
They took the stigma issue .
What they do is extraordinary .
And yes , my SING Campaign supported Treatment Action Campaign to try to increase consciousness and also try to raise funds .
Many of the funds I &apos;ve been able to raise have gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and incredible work they do , and they continue to do in South Africa .
So , this is my SING Campaign .
Basically SING Campaign is me and about three or four wonderful people supporting me .
I &apos;ve traveled all over the world over the last two and a half years , and I &apos;ve visited about 12 different countries .
Here I &apos;m in Norway , A Oslo , and I get a beautiful check . Here I sing in Hong Kong , to support fundraising .
In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play for an audience mostly of white people in the South African middle class who found themselves in tears because I showed them movies that touched their heart , and the real nature of this terrible tragedy that &apos;s happening , that people tend to avoid because it &apos;s tired , and they don &apos;t know what the solutions can be .
Aaron Motsoaldi , the minister of current health , participated in the concert , and I met him , and he confirmed me the total commitment to try to bring about change , which is absolutely necessary .
This is in Scottish Parliament .
And then I became an invitation for Scotland and HIV .
And I told them my experiences , looking , again , to address them .
And again , in Edinburgh , with the wonderful African Childrenn &apos;s Choir , which I love .
And it &apos;s children like them , many of them remain orphan because of the families affected by the AIDS virus .
Here I am in New York with Michael Sidibe , the director of UNAIDS .
I &apos;m very honored that Michel invited me , just a few months ago , to become UNAIDS ambassador .
So I reinforced my platform and expanded my boundaries .
The message that UNAIDS is currently sending to the world says that we would like to see the potential elimination of the transmission of the virus from mom to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we believe it &apos;s achievable with political will .
It can be done .
Here I am with a pregnant woman , HIV-positive , and we both smile because we are very confident , because we know that that young woman is getting the care she needs to extend her life so she can take care of the child she &apos;s about to be born .
And his baby will get PMTCT , and that means that that child will not be born with the virus .
This is prevention from the beginning of life .
And it &apos;s a way to start interacting with the pandemic of AIDS .
Now I want to conclude by telling you the short story of Avelile .
This is Avelile . It &apos;s with me everywhere I go .
I tell all of her story because she represents one of the millions of orphans of HIV / AIDS .
Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV viron , and she died of AIDS related diseases .
Avelile was infected with the virus . She was born with the virus .
Here we see it at age seven . It doesn &apos;t weigh more than a one-year-old .
At this point in his life , he &apos;s hungry for AIDS , and he has pneumonia .
We met him at Eastern Cape hospital and spent the entire afternoon with this lovely little girl .
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
There they submitted it to a very particular nutritional diet , and they took care of her .
And when we left the hospital — because we filmed his story — we didn &apos;t know if he was going to survive .
And of course — it was a very emotional encounter , and it was very touched to us , because of the direct experience with this little girl , you know , with her story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
And I feel — I have the brivids — I don &apos;t know if you can see my goose skin .
I have goosebumps because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transformation that happened .
Isn &apos;t that amazing ?
( Applause ) These applause are actually for doctors and nurses in the hospital who took care of Avelile .
And I think you realize that you approved this transformation .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , every single one of you in the audience , if you consider that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good health care , and if you consider that the Millennium Development Goals in particular five and six , they absolutely must have the commitment of all governments in the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa , you might stand up .
I think it &apos;s fair to say that they &apos;re almost all in the room .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago , in the former Soviet Union , a team of engineers secretly moved a big object through a desolate campaign .
With that object , they were hoping to capture the attention of the world by conquering space for the first .
The rocket was huge .
And slammed into his nose was a silver ball with two radio antennae , and in his nose there was a silver ball with two radio antennae .
On October 4th of 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote , at the time , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to create a new planet , which we &apos;re going to call Sputnik . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to create a new planet , which we &apos;re going to call Sputnik .
In the past , explorers like Vasco de Gama or Cristoforo Colombo in the past , explorers like Vasco de Gama or Cristoforo Colombo were fortunate enough to discover the Earth &apos;s globe .
We now have the fortune of conquering space , and in the future they will send us .
Now we have the fortune of conquering space , and in the future they will send us . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re seeing Sputnik images , my fifth documentary , which is practically completed . It tells the story of &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; and what I &apos;m going to give you .
It &apos;s basically completed . It tells the story of &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; and what you &apos;ll get from it , which is basically completed . It tells the story of &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; and what I &apos;ll get from it .
For days and days after the launch , Sputnik was a fantastic curiosity . For days and days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
An artificial moon , visible by ordinary citizens , who inspired pride and fear for the fact that humans had finally launched an object in space .
But only three days later , one day called the Thursday Red , the media and politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was the demonstration of media and politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was the demonstration that our enemy had beat us in science and technology that our enemies had beat us into science and technology and now they could attack us with a modern-day omb , using a modernist .
It was a moment of general panic .
Sputnik soon became one of the three great shock that hit America — historians compare it to Pearl Harbor and 9 / 11 .
It stimulated the production of missiles , the race to space , and the weapons .
It stimulated the production of missiles , the race to space , and the weapons .
It stimulated the production of missiles , the race to space , and the weapons .
Within a year , Congress greatly increased the funding for weapons and went from 1200 to 20,000 nuclear weapons , and we went from 1200 to 20,000 nuclear weapons .
But Sputnik &apos;s reactions went much further .
For example , some of you may remember this day , June 1958 , for example , some of you may remember this day , June 1958 , the day of the national defense practice when tens of millions of people in 78 cities fell underground .
Or the Gallup poll that showed that seven out of 10 Americans believe that a nuclear war would happen , and at least 50 percent of our population would be killed , and at least 50 percent of our population would have been killed .
But Sputnik also promoted a lot of positive changes .
Some of us got an education through Sputnik , some of us got an education through Sputnik .
The support of engineering , mathematics and science , and education in general , exploded .
Vint Cerf emphasizes how Sputnik directly led to ARPA , and the Internet , and of course NASA directly led to ARPA , and to the Internet , and of course to NASA .
My documentary shows how media agreement can install fear in a free society , my documentary shows how media agreement can install fear in a free society .
But it also shows how we can transform what seems like a negative beginning into something that was overall positive for America .
&quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will come out soon .
In closing , I &apos;d like to take advantage of it to thank one of my investors , in closing , I &apos;d like to take advantage of it to thank one of my investors , the long-lived TEDster Jay Walker .

Good morning . Magic is a beautiful way to stand above the curve of reality , to make possible today what science will actually transform tomorrow .
As a cyber magician , they combine elements of illusion and science to give us a sense of what future technologies will make us feel .
You &apos;ve probably all heard about the glasses of the Google Glass project .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look at it through and the world that you see is integrated by data : names of places , monuments , buildings , someday even the names of strangers you meet on the street .
These are my illusions &apos; glasses .
They &apos;re a little bit bigger . It &apos;s a prototype .
When you look at it through , look into the mind of a cyberillusionist .
Let me show you what I mean .
We just need a game card . Whatever paper is fine .
Like this . I teach it so that we can recognize it when we see it again .
All right . A very visible sign .
We put it back in the deck , somewhere in the middle , and we start .
( Music ) Voice : The system is ready . Acquisition is going on .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made of four seeds : hearts , flowers , paintings and spades .
These cards are among the oldest symbols , and they &apos;ve been played in many different ways .
Some people say the four seeds represent the four seasons .
There &apos;s spring , summer , fall and — Voice : My favorite season is winter . MT : Well , yes , even mine .
The winter is magic . It &apos;s a period of change , when the heat turns cold , the water turns into snow , and then everything goes away .
There are 13 cards for every seed . ( Music ) Voice : Every card represents one of the 13 stages of the long cycle .
MT : Here we have the low tide , and here &apos;s the high tide , and there &apos;s the moon in the middle .
Voice : The moon is one of the strongest symbols of magic .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
There &apos;s the red color and the black color that represent the constant change from day to night .
Voice : Marco , I didn &apos;t know I could do something like this . ( Laughter ) MT : And it &apos;s a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you add all the points into a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in one year , the number of days in one birthday and another .
Get a wish . ( Ball noises ) Voice : Don &apos;t unveil it otherwise doesn &apos;t happen .
MT : Well , I actually got my first piece of cards on the day of my sixth birthday , and from that day , I traveled around the world doing magic for children and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even king and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : So who are these ? MT : Ah , a twitch . Look .
Wake up .
Jolly : Uau . MT : Are you ready for the party ?
Jolly : Hello ! MT : Let &apos;s see what you can do .
Jolly : I &apos;m going to introduce you to my stick . MT : Ah . Listen .
Jolly : Uah , uah , uah , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I &apos;m exposing myself for a different kind of audience .
I &apos;m exhausting for you .
Voice : Taxed Carta . MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how to get magical . Is it a full-time job ?
Absolutely not ! You have to practice 24 hours , seven days on 7 .
I don &apos;t mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
It &apos;s a little exaggeration , but it takes practice . Somebody will say that magic has to be a job for some kind of diabolic , supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Uah .
Well , I say no , no .
In fact , in Germany it &apos;s called nein , nein . ( Laughter ) The magic is not that challenging . I have to warn you , though , if you play cards with someone who &apos;s handling cards like this , don &apos;t play money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? It &apos;s a good hand .
The odds of having it are 4165 to one .
MT : Yeah , but I think my hand is better . We &apos;re paying probabilities .
Voice : I think you &apos;ve made your wish . MT : And that leaves me the last and most important paper : the one with this very significant sign .
And contrary to everything we just saw , virtual or less . Voice : Instructed Carta .
Digital MT : This is definitely true .
MT : Hi , hi . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I worked at MIT for 44 years . I attended the first TED building .
The third issue is a little bit obvious .
Are they all agreed ? No , not entirely .
I buy . I have a lot of that money .
I have so much money that would take me forever to spend them .
I grew up in Bihar , the poorest state in India , and I remember when I was six years old , I came home one day and found a cart on the door full of sweaty shirts .
My brother and I got thrown , and then my father came home .
It was furious , I still remember how much we cried when the cart with sweet for half eaten was taken away .
I later realized why my father was angry .
Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor trying to push my father to assign him a state contract .
My father was building roads in Bihar , and he was constantly opposed to corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
It was a solitary battle , because Bihar was also the state of the most corrupt India , where official public got richer , instead of serving the poor who had no means to express their angst if their children had no food or education .
I lived it viscerally , traveling to remote villages to study poverty .
Going from village to village , I remember one day , I was hungry and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing under a tree in a warm tortodo , and right at that moment , one of the poorest men in the village invited me to his poo and kindly gave me food .
Only after that , I realized that what she gave me was two days &apos; food for her whole family .
This deep generosity challenged me and changed the purpose of my life .
I decided to give back .
Later , I joined the World Bank , trying to fight this poverty by transferring aid from rich countries to poor countries .
I first worked in Uganda , where I focused on reform negotiation with the Minister of Finance of Uganda to get access to our loans .
But after giving loans , I remember a trip to Uganda where he found recently building schools without text books and professors , new clinics without drugs , and the poor still once without voice and aid .
It was again like in Bihar .
Bihar is the development challenge : miserable poverty surrounded by corruption .
On a global level , 1.3 billion people live under 1.25 dollars a day and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that have been implemented since 1944 , when World War II winners , 500 founding fathers , and a single founding mother , came together in the New Hampshire , the United States , to fuse the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
And that traditional approach to development had three key elements : First , the transfer of resources from the wealthy countries to the poorest countries in South , accompanied by reform indications .
Secondly , the development institutions that brought these transfers were opaque , untransparent about what they funded or what they achieved .
And third , engagement in the developing world ran out of a small government elite with little interaction with citizens , which are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
Today , each of these elements is opening up because of radical changes in the global environment .
Open knowledge , open aid , open authority , and together , represent the key changes that are transforming development and giving great hope to the problems that I &apos;ve seen in Uganda and Bihar .
The first key change is open knowledge .
The developing world today will not simply accept second-hand solutions from the United States , Europe or the World Bank .
They take inspiration , hope , and practical skills , from the emerging economies of South Africa .
They want to know how China has bothered 500 million people in 30 years , like the Oportunidades program in Mexico has improved schooling and nutrition of millions of children .
This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows , not just from North to South , but from South to South , even from South to North , with the Mexican Oportunidades program that now inspires the city of New York .
And just like these transfers from North to South are opening up , the same is the development institutions that deliver these transfers .
This is the second change : open aid .
Recently , the World Bank opened its public use bank , publishing 8,000 economic and social indicators of 200 countries over 50 years and launched a global competition to collect via crowdsourcing innovative applications using this data .
The institutions of development today are also opening up public examination the projects that fund .
Take GeoMapping . In this map of Kenya , the red dots show the position of schools funded by donors , and the more green the green area is , the more children who finished school .
This simple combination reveals that donors have not funded schools in areas with the most number of children without access to school , generating new questions . Development assistance is addressed to those who need help ?
In this way , the World Bank has now mapped 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and donors use a common platform to map their projects .
This is a tremendous step forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
From my point of view , this leads to the third and most significant change in development : open authorities . Today governments are opening up as much as citizens require listening and responsibility .
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , they use cell phones and social media not only for political reasons but also for development responsibilities .
Governments are providing services to citizens ?
For example , different governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening up their budget to the public .
But there &apos;s a big difference between a public budget and a affordable budget .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) As you can see , it &apos;s not really affordable or understandable for a normal citizen trying to figure out how government spends its resources .
To address this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget in a more understandable way to the public .
In this map of Moldova , green color shows those regions that have limited spending in schools but good school results and red color shows the opposite .
Struments like this help transform a shelf full of incomprehensible documents into a publicly understandable view , and what &apos;s great is that with this openness , there are now new opportunities for citizens to give back government feedback and engage .
Today in the Philippines , parents and students can give real time feedback on the site Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , if at school they &apos;re in textbooks and professors , the same problems I &apos;ve seen in Uganda and Bihar .
The government is receptive . For example , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairments had stopped because of corruption , the Department of Philippines Education immediately acted .
And you know what &apos;s great about this : this innovation is spreading from South to South , from Philippines to Indonesia , to Kenya , to Moldova and beyond .
In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even a very poor community has been able to use these tools to voice their desires .
This is the map of Tandal in August 2011 , but within a few weeks , university students were able to use cell phones and an open platform to completely map the entire infrastructure of the community .
What &apos;s wonderful is that citizens were then able to report on water points or health that didn &apos;t work , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , that together provide a graphic visualization of the collective voices of poverty .
Today , even the Bihar is changing and opening up with a dedicated leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and reactive to the poor .
But in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or serving the poor and it &apos;s a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are solitary warriors like my father and many others and a key frontier of work on development is to help these solitary warriors bring together efforts so that they can overcome adversity .
For example , today in Ghana of the brave civil society reformers , parliament and government , have created a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector and galvanized by this , the reformers in parliament are now investigating suspicious contracts .
These examples give a new hope , new possibilities to the problems I &apos;ve seen in Uganda or my father confronted in Bihar .
Two years ago , on April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was late at night , and at 80 , he was writing a reverse of public interest in 70 pages against corruption on a road project .
Even though he wasn &apos;t a lawyer , he supported the case alone in court the next day , and the judge said right , but that same night , he fell and died .
It turned out until the end , increasingly convinced that to fight corruption and poverty , not only should government be honest , but citizens had to come together to make their voices heard .
These became the two columns of his life , and the journey he made in the middle reflected the change in the landscape of development .
Today , I &apos;m enlightened by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we &apos;re taking these new directions , a significant distance from my work in Uganda by 20 years .
We have to radically open development so that knowledge flows in different directions , whether it &apos;s inspiration for professionals , so that aid becomes transparent , responsible and effective , so that governments open up and citizens are engaged and responsible for reformers in governments .
We need to accelerate these changes .
If we do that , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , Uganda and beyond .
We will find that textbooks and teachers will be present in school for their children .
We &apos;ll find that these children also have a real chance to get out of poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Imagine a plane that &apos;s about to crash with 250 kids and children , and if you knew how to stop it , would you do it ?
Imagine 60 planes full of children under five years crashing every day .
It &apos;s the number of children who don &apos;t get to the fifth birthday .
Sixty-six million children don &apos;t get to five .
Most of these deaths are preventable , and this is not only makes me sad , it makes me angry and it makes me determined .
Diarrhea and pneumonia are the two main causes of death in children under five years , and we can avoid these diseases not through some new intelligent technology .
But through one of the oldest inventions : soap .
Working with soap , a granted habit , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by a third .
Working with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , tracoma , SARS , and recently in the case of cholera and Ebola epidemic , one of the key interventions is washing your hands with soap .
Working with soap keeps kids in school .
It teaches children to die .
Working with soap is one of the cheapest ways to save children &apos;s lives .
It can save over 600 children a year .
It &apos;s the equivalent of preventing 10 jumbo a day full of babies to crash .
I guess you &apos;ll agree that this is a useful public health intervention .
Take a minute .
I think you have to know the person next to you .
Because you don &apos;t shake your hand .
Shake your hand out .
Well , you know .
It &apos;s really cute .
All right .
And if I told you that the person you just shake your hand didn &apos;t wash your hands after you went to the bathroom ? ( Laughter ) It &apos;s no longer that cute , right ?
What a hell , you &apos;ll agree with me .
The statistics show that four out of five people don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the bathroom , globally .
Similarly , we don &apos;t do it in beautiful bathrooms , with current water , soap at the disposal , it &apos;s the same in countries where child mortality is very high .
What is it ? Isn &apos;t there soap ?
Actually , the soap is there .
In 90 percent of homes in India , 94 percent of homes in Kenya , you will find soap .
Even in countries where there &apos;s little soap , like in Ethiopia , we &apos;re 50 percent .
So why ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
Why Mayank , the guy I met in India , don &apos;t you wash your hands ?
In Mayank &apos;s family , the soap is used to bathe , to make the laundry , the soap is used to wash the dishes .
Parents sometimes think it &apos;s a valuable asset , so they keep it in the closet .
They keep it out of its grasp because it &apos;s not wasted .
On average , in Mayank &apos;s family , they use soap to wash their hands once a day in the best guess , and sometimes even once a week .
What are the consequences ?
Children take diseases where the more they should be loved and protected at home .
Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn at school ?
I think behavior experts will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change behavior as kids .
However , we copy everybody else &apos;s doing , and local cultural norms affect our behavior , and that &apos;s where private sector comes in .
In Asia and Africa , every second 111 mothers buy this soap to protect their family .
Many women in India will tell you that they learned everything about hygiene , disease , from this Lifebuoy sail .
The representative brands have the responsibility to do good in places where they sell their products .
It &apos;s this belief , plus the Unilever dimension , that allows us to continue to talk about washing their hands with soap and hygiene for these mothers .
Big companies and brands can change , change these social norms and make a difference for these very resilient habits .
Think about it : marketing is constantly trying to get us from one brand to another .
And it knows how to turn science and facts into compelling messages .
Just for a minute , imagine when they pull out the force behind a strong message as washing their hands with soap .
The profit driver turns health into this world .
It happened for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 during Victorian England to counter cholera .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the Minister of Health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s an epidemic of cholera in Ghana right now .
118 years later , the solution is exactly the same : it &apos;s about ensure that they have access to this soap and they use it , because it &apos;s the first solution to stop the spread of cholera .
I think the profit movement is very strong , sometimes stronger than the most committed charity or the government .
Government does what it can , especially for pandemics and epidemics like cholera , or Ebola right now , but with priorities in conflict .
The budgets are not always there .
Think about what it takes to wash your hands becomes a daily habit , you need continuous funds to match behavior .
In short , those who struggle for public health depend on soap companies to keep promoting washing their hands with soap .
We have friends like USAID , Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing of Soap , London of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , Plan , WaterAid , who all believe in a winning collaboration for everyone .
It &apos;s winning for the public sector , because we help it achieve the goals .
It &apos;s winning for the private sector , because we build new generations of future cleaned hands .
And most importantly , it &apos;s winning for the most vulnerable .
On October 15th , we will celebrate the national day of clean hands .
Scubes , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — and on that day even our competitors — we &apos;ll all join together to celebrate the most important public health intervention in the world .
What we need , and again , where the private sector can make a huge difference , is to pull out the creative thinking that leads to support .
If you take our Help campaign in Child Reach 5 , we made big videos that would bring the message of washing their hands with soap to ordinary people intuitively .
We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
Most of the arguments are still going on .
I invite you to spend five minutes watching these films .
I come from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
I grew up in a family where every conversation at the table was about social justice .
I grew up in primary European schools for public health .
I think I &apos;m one of the few women in my country with this qualification and the only one with a Ph.D. in washing their hands with soap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , with a public health career in training , I decided I could have a significant impact , selling and promoting the best invention of the world for public health : soap .
Today we run the largest hand washing program in the world according to any standard of public health .
We &apos;ve reached 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambition to reach a billion by 2020 .
Over the last four years , the industry has grown at double-digit , whereas child mortality has reduced to all the places where soap use has increased .
It might sound bad for some people to feel the growth of the industry and lives saved resonating in the same sentence , but it &apos;s that growth that allows us to do more .
Without it , and without talking about it , we can &apos;t make the changes necessary .
Last week , my team and I went to visit mothers who all lived the same thing : the death of a baby .
I &apos;m a mom , I can &apos;t imagine anything stronger and more painful .
This is from Myanmar .
She had the best smile , the smile , I think , of life when she gives you a second chance .
His son , Myo , is his second son .
He had a three-week daughter , and we know that most of the children who die , die during the first month of life , and we know that by giving a soap to every ostetric , and if soap is used before we touch children , we can reduce those numbers .
This is what inspires me , it drives me to continue on this mission , to know that I can provide them with what they need to do the best job in the world : grow a baby .
Next time you think about a gift for a mama and her family , don &apos;t look far away : buy a soap .
It &apos;s the best invention of public health .
I hope you &apos;ll join us because washing your hands becomes part of your everyday life and our daily life and helping other kids like Myo reach five .
Thank you .

These are simple things : orologists , keys , bribes , glass .
These are things that the victims of the genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
We all know these mundane things well .
The fact that some victims brought personal objects like toothpaste and toothbrush is a clear signal that they had no idea what was going to happen to them .
Usually , they were told they were going to be exchanged with prisoners of war .
These objects have been retrieved by several common threats all over the globe , and right now , forensic physicians are exhuming bodies from a common discovery , 20 years after the war .
And it &apos;s probably the biggest thing that &apos;s ever been discovered .
During the four years of the conflict that devastated Bosnia in the early 1990s , about 30,000 citizens , mostly civilians , disappeared , were supposed to be killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat .
Most of them were killed in the early days of war or the end of hostility , when the secure parts of the United Nations like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serbian army .
The international criminal court emitted many sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
genocide is the systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
Genocide means killing .
It &apos;s about destroying property , cultural heritage , and basically the proof of their existence .
Genocide doesn &apos;t just mean killing ; it means denying identity .
There are always traces , perfect crime doesn &apos;t exist .
There are always remains of the dead who are more enduring than their fragile bodies and our selective and evanescent memory .
These objects are retrieved by several commons , and the main goal of this collection of objects is a unique accomplishment of those who have disappeared in those homicides , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust time .
All bodies have to be discovered and identified .
Once they recover , these objects that the victims brought with them on the way of the execution are carefully repulsed , analyzed , cataloged and conserved .
Thousands of waste are replaced in plastic bags like the ones you see in CSI .
These objects are used as forged tools for visual detection of victims , but they &apos;re also used as a precious forensic trial in the trial for war crimes .
The survivors are occasionally called to try to physically identify objects , but physical research is an extremely difficult , ineffective and painful process .
Once legal doctors and lawyers ended up with these things , they become orphans of the story .
Many are destroyed , believe it or not , or they &apos;re just archived , far from the eyes , far from the heart .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single object that was recreated to create a visual archive that survivors could easily access .
As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
I like to go beyond consciousness .
In this case , someone might recognize these objects or at least photographs will resist as permanent , unbiased and accurate memories of what happened .
Photography is empathy , and the familiarity of these objects guarantees empathy .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a forensic physician , if you will , and the result is just as close as possible to a document .
Once you identify all the missing people , they will only remain the bodies in decomposition in their tombs and these everyday objects .
In their simplicity , these objects are the last test of victims &apos;s identity , the last permanent memory that these people have existed .
Thank you very much .

It can &apos;t be good .
I prefer chocolate chocolate chambers .
So I &apos;d like to show you something that I &apos;m working on .
There are some things that I learned when I was trying to challenge these 30 days .
This is part of the goal of taking a picture a day for a month .
I would never have been so adventurous to do such a business .
It &apos;s bad .
In fact , I &apos;m a big deal of life .
( Applause )
Hi . I &apos;d like to talk to you today about some work that we carry forward .
Because they &apos;re still working on this , we &apos;re still moving into the limits of intuition and mystery .
I &apos;m going to try to explain to you some of the experiences that we would like to do through every work .
The first job is called the Imperial Monocronomes .
A spectator enters almost unexpectedly in the room , and he sees that he escapes these panels arranged unorderly on the wall .
After a few seconds , as if the panels had noticed the presence of the visitor , they seem to act and try to compose a perfect symmetry .
( Laughter ) This is the draft of the two situations .
One is complete chaos . The other one is perfect order .
And we were interested in seeing how a small change could lead from one state to another .
This also reminds us of two very different political traditions .
On the one hand , the altar pale of the 20th century , and the other one goes back about 100 years ago , the abstract compositions of Malevich .
I &apos;d like to show you a video .
To give you an idea of scale , the largest panel is about two meters .
That &apos;s about the size of it . And the smallest is like an A4 sheet .
The visitor reaches that area , and they take the attention .
And after a while , if the visitor continues to stay in the area , the panels become more or less immunized to the presence of the visitor and become again independent and disactive , until they feel a presence in the room or a movement , coming back to the attention .
( Laughter ) It seems to be the visitor to submit the order impression between the panels , but it might also be the opposite , which is that the panels are trapped in their loyed behaviors and attributed to the viewer the role of the shot .
This brings me to a quieter and smaller job called Handled .
The viewer sees a piece of paper set on a wall at the bottom , but when you approach it , you find that it &apos;s a white sheet A4 or a letter , smiled on both sides of two small hands that seem to be sculpted by a strain of wood with a lot of carefully and precision .
Even the visitor noticed that the entire sculpture is moving very slowly , as if these two hands were trying to hold the sheet up for a long time , and somehow they &apos;re not succeeding .
So this precariousness in motion looks a lot like the unstable nature of the images seen through a hand-held camera .
I &apos;m going to show you two videos in parallel .
One through a fixed camera and the other through a handheld camera .
You &apos;ll quickly notice how the unstable nature of the video implies the presence of a viewer and a subjective perspective .
So we removed the car and transferred the movement to the panel .
This is the video .
You have to imagine the other hand . There &apos;s no more .
As far as we are , we try to reproduce a self-exclusion attitude , as if there was a small person with arms held behind this huge piece of paper .
It &apos;s as if we compare it to the amount of effort to the viewer &apos;s service and delicately present this piece of paper to the visitor , in front of him .
The next job is Decoy .
It &apos;s a cardboard model , so the object is as high as I am .
It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very high antenna like head , and its only purpose is to attract attention to itself .
When a visitor passes in front of him , he prizes himself on one side to the other , and he shakes his hands faster and faster as the person approaches .
Here &apos;s the first environment to test it .
You see the two integrated movements , and the object seems to use all of its being to express despair .
But the idea is that once it attracted attention , it &apos;s no longer interested and it &apos;s already looking for the attention of another person .
( Laughter ) This is the final structure of Decoy .
It seems to be produced in a series like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
Because we always work within a very personal space , we like the way the consumer aesthetics customize the object by giving us , at least in appearance , a little bit away .
So for us , this is kind of a threatening thing that tries to distract you from the things that you really should focus on , but it can also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
The next job is an object , which is also a kind of musical instrument .
It &apos;s reduced to the size of anphycliff that the audience is seen by the people on the stage .
Where I am , every one of you looks this big , and the audience somehow occupies all my visual field .
Sitting in the audience is 996 little sagoon .
They &apos;re designed to mechanically applaud their will .
It means that each one of them can decide whether and when they applaud , intensity , duration , how much to influence others or how to influence them once and their eventual contribution to innovation .
When the viewer is in front of the audience , there will be a reaction .
They can be bright applause or fires , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage and there will be a reaction again from the audience .
It could be anything , like weak applause of some public members , or even a relentless ovation .
As far as it comes to us , we have an audience in front of as an object or organism that also has quality of music , as a tool .
The viewer can process , through complex production , sound models or evanescent musical models , but he can &apos;t submit in the audience a true kind of reaction .
We find a certain sense of judgment , of unpredictability and agitation .
It also has an attractive , almost deceptive quality .
As you can see , we &apos;re all excited about these heads separating in two parts , forming hands .
Here &apos;s a little visual animation , as if the two parts of the brain coded against each other to create the sense of duality and tension .
Here &apos;s the prototype .
We can &apos;t wait to be invited by 996 specimens .
This is the last job . This is called the Framerunners .
It comes from the idea of the window .
This is a real window in our office , and as you can see , it &apos;s made out of three different pieces of wood sections .
We used the same vocabulary of the window to build our canvas or our reticle that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be seen from both sides .
This knife is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
These are three different measures to give you a sense of perspective or landscape on one plane .
Every figure can go back and forth along the rail and hide behind two adjacent binaries .
Unlike this rectangle so narrow , we wanted to give these figures a very comic and funny sense , as if he moved them a puppeteer that physically drives them along the way .
We like the idea of these figures jumping up as if they were unaware and disguised and pleasant , until they understand a movement of the viewer and hide behind the nearest wall .
So for us , this work also presents a contradiction .
These figures appear to be trapped inside this rigid knife , which looks like a prison , but also a fortress because it allows them to be unaware , effectiveness , dispersed and isolated from the outside world .
All these qualities of real life that I &apos;m talking about are transferred to a particular technical configuration , and we were lucky to collaborate with the ETH of Zurich to develop the first prototype .
As you can see , they extracted the moving gear from our animations and created a movement that integrated the head movement up and down and forth and forth .
It &apos;s really small .
You can see it can be in the palm of my hand .
Imagine our joy when we actually saw it in the studio , and there it is .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
And I wanted to work this way .
This was the plan .
I was all ready . But then , actually , the deadline came up and I did this .
( Laughter ) And it happened every single time .
Then , the moment of the 90 page thesis came along , which you should work on a year .
I knew that for thesis , my usual rhythm wasn &apos;t right .
The project was too long .
This year would have passed like this .
How hard can it be to scale ?
Those early months ?
So , I made a beautiful new plan .
( Laughter ) But then — ( Laughter ) Even those intermediate months went by , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and so I found myself here .
Then , two months became one , which became two weeks old .
I thought it was over there .
They say , &quot; &quot; I talk to Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And they say , we have to talk about his thesis . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; That &apos;s the best we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s not true . ( Laughter )
The argument was really bad . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy that moment when you all thought , &quot; This guy is great ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was really bad .
Anyway , I &apos;m a writer and blogger today .
I write on the Wait and Why blog .
And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
My theory was that the procrastinator brain was actually different from other people &apos;s brains .
To test it , I found a laboratory in RM that allowed me to examine both my brain , both a real non-procrastinator , so that I could compare it .
I took them here to show you today .
I &apos;m asking you to look at them carefully to see if you notice the difference .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) A difference is there .
Both have a rational decision , but the procrastinator brain also has an immediate gratification monkey .
What does this mean for a procrastinator ?
It means everything is fine , until this happens .
&#91; Now it &apos;s the best time to work a little bit . &#93; &#91; No . &#93; So the decision will make a rational decision to do something productive , but the monkey doesn &apos;t like it , so he takes control and he says , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s just read the whole page of Wikipedia on the scandal Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding , just because I just remembered it .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to take a while , &quot; &quot; so , there &apos;s really no time to work today .
Except . &quot; &quot; ( Screaming ) What &apos;s going on ?
The monkey doesn &apos;t seem to be the guy you want to be a rudder .
She lives entirely in the present .
It has no memory of the past and no conception of the future , and they only care about two things : the easy and the fun .
In the animal world , that &apos;s fine .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend all your life doing just easy and fun things , you &apos;re a success story .
( Laughter ) And for Scimmy , humans are just an animal species .
You have to feed you , sleep and reproduce yourself in a new generation . That could be good at the time of tribes .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed that , we &apos;re not at the time of tribes .
We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , but the monkey doesn &apos;t know what it is .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s someone else in the brain : the rational decision , with which we do things that other animals can &apos;t do .
We can imagine the future .
We can see the big picture .
We need to make long-term plans .
And he wants to be aware of this .
And it just wants us to do what makes sense to do right now .
Sometimes , it makes sense to do something easy and funny , like when you &apos;re at dinner or you go to sleep , or enjoy your free time .
And there &apos;s a overlap .
Sometimes the two agree .
But sometimes , it makes a lot more sense to do things that are harder and less pleasant , because of the overall picture .
And that &apos;s where we have a conflict .
And for the procrastinator , that conflict always ends up in a way , spending a lot of time in this orange area , an easy and fun place outside the circle of what makes sense .
I call it the dark playground .
( Laughter ) The dark playground is a place that all of you procrastinators know very well .
It &apos;s where you do the lake activities in those moments where you shouldn &apos;t do it .
The fun in the playground is not just fun , because it &apos;s not earned . There &apos;s a sense of guilt , fear , anxiety , hate yourself — all feelings of good procrastinator .
And the question is , in this situation , with the rudder monkey , how does the procrastinator move here , in the blue area , much less pleasant place , but where do you do the important things ?
Well , you have to know that the procrastinator has a janitor angel , somebody who looks at it from above and protects it in the hardest moments — somebody called the panic monster .
( Laughter ) For most of the time , the monster of the sleeping panic but wakes up all of a sudden , every time you get a deadline , or there &apos;s a danger of a public embarrassment , a disaster on work or some scary consequence .
In my life , the monster showed up , quite recently , because about six months ago , TED staff contacted me and invited me to do a presentation .
( Laughter ) Of course I said yes .
I &apos;ve always dreamed of doing a TED Talk before .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of the frenzy , the decision seemed to think about something else .
He said , &quot; &quot; Are we sure what we accepted ?
Did we understand what &apos;s going to happen in the future one day ?
We have to sit down and work on it now , and the monkey says , &quot; &quot; Completely agree , but we open Google Earth , and we zoom in south of India , 60 meters above the surface , and we flip the page for two and a half hours until we get to the top of the country so we get an idea of India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
Six months became four , then two and then one , and the TED staff decided to publish the names of the speakers .
I opened the site and there , there was my face looking at me .
And guess who woke up ?
( Laughter ) The panic monster starts to lose its head , and a few seconds later , the whole system is chaos . ( Laughter )
And the monkey — remember it &apos;s afraid of the monster — go , go to the tree !
And finally , finally , the decisor takes the command and and I can start working .
Now , the monster explains all sorts of strange behaviors of the procrastinator , like , like one like me can spend two weeks unable to write the initial sentence of a relationship , and then miraculously finds the incredible working ethic to spend the night in white writing eight pages .
And all of this with the three characters — this is the procrastinator system .
It &apos;s not beautiful , but it works .
That &apos;s what I wanted to write about blog a couple of years ago .
When I did that , I was surprised by the reaction .
I literally got thousands of emails from all sorts of people , from all over the world , doing different things .
What struck me was the contrast between the happy pitch of the article and the serious email .
I thought about it and I said , well , if the system works , then where &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all miserable ?
The fact is that there are two kinds of procrastrination .
All the examples I &apos;ve done today , they have deadlines , and if there are deadlines .
If you want a career , where you &apos;re enterprising , for example in the arts , or being an entrepreneur , at first , there &apos;s no deadlines , because nothing is happening , not until you &apos;ve moved to get things started .
Now , if for the procrastinator , the only way to do things is the monster , then there &apos;s a problem , because in all these situations without deadline , the monster is not shown .
And it &apos;s this kind of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and much less discussed than the funniest , short-term , related to deadlines .
It &apos;s usually done silently and private .
And it can be the source of a great long-term granted , and regret .
And I thought , that &apos;s why all these people write me down and that &apos;s why they &apos;re unhappy .
It &apos;s not that I &apos;m late with projects .
It &apos;s that long-term procrastination makes them feel like spectators , their lives , sometimes .
They weren &apos;t frustrated because they didn &apos;t realize their dreams , but because they weren &apos;t even able to follow them .
So , I read the email and I had a little lighting — I mean , I don &apos;t think the non-procrastinators exist .
Right . I think all of you are a procrastinator .
You may not all be helpless , as some of us are , ( Laughter ) and some of you may even have a healthy relationship with deadlines , but remember , the most subtle joke in the monkey happens when there are no deadlines .
I want to show you one last thing .
I call it the calendar of life .
A box for every week of a life of 90 years .
It &apos;s not that many boxes , especially because we &apos;ve already used several of them .
I think we have to look carefully and long at this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastination , because in life , each one of us procrastination on something .
This is a task for all of us .
And since there aren &apos;t so many boxes , it &apos;s a task that maybe it should start today .
Well , maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) But ...
Soon .
Thank you .

There &apos;s a man named Captain William Swenson who was recently joined by the Onor Institute of Congress for his conduct on 9 / 11 , 2009 .
That day , a column of American troops and Afghanistan were going through a region of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials who should have met with some elderly in the village .
The column submitted a lump , and it was surrounded on three sides , and among other things , Captain Swenson was rewarded for running in the open fire to save the wounds and recover the dead .
And the amazing thing about that day is that , by pure coincidence , one of the two doctors on the helicopter had a GoPro camera on the helmet and photographed the whole scene .
It shows Captain Swenson and his commiliton to take a helicopter a wounded soldier who had shot the neck .
They put it on the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend forward and give them a kiss before they turn around and go and save other lives .
I saw the movie and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; Where do people come from ?
Why do they do that ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very , very profound emotion that drives one person to act like this .
There &apos;s love , and I wanted to know why people I work with are not like this .
You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice for the good of others .
In the company , you give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others to benefit from them .
It works backwards . Right ?
So I asked myself , where do people come from this ?
And my initial conclusion was this .
These people are drawn to the notion of service .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
What I &apos;ve learned is that it depends on the environment , and if you find the right environment , each of us has the ability to do these remarkable things , and most importantly , other people have it .
I had the great honor of knowing some of these people that we call heroes , who have risked themselves and their lives to save others &apos;s lives , and I asked them , &quot; Why would you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And everybody says the same thing : &quot; Because they would do it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s the deep sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are really important .
The problem with the concepts of trust and collaboration is that they are sensations , not instructions .
I can &apos;t just tell you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
I can &apos;t just teach two people to cooperate , and they will .
That &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years at the age of Paleolithic , until the early years of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was full of dangers , the whole nature put it all together to kill us .
Not personal .
Whether it was time , the lack of resources , maybe a sabe tiger , all these natural elements were there to reduce the duration of our lives .
And so we evolved in social animals , living together and working together in what I call the security cycle , in the tribe , where we felt good .
And when we felt safe among our peers , the natural response was trust and collaboration .
They are benefits that characterize this condition .
It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that some of my tribe will guard me .
If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , it means you &apos;re not going to be guard .
Pretty good survival system .
The modern age works exactly the same way .
The world is full of dangers , things that try to overcome us and stop us from being successful , reducing our chances of making it happen .
They can be the highs and lows of the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
It can be a new technology that makes your business model obsolete from day to day .
Or it could be the competition that sometimes tries to kill you .
Sometimes it tries to exclude you from the business world , but as a minimum it tries instantly to stop you from growing and trying to steal your business .
We can &apos;t control these forces .
They &apos;re a constant and they &apos;re never going to disappear .
The only variable is conditions inside an organization , and that &apos;s where leadership finds its importance because it &apos;s the leader who decides .
When a leader makes a choice to prioritize security and people &apos;s lives in the organization to sacrifice their convenience in favor of tangible results , so that people remain secure and feel accepted , remarkable things happen .
I had to travel on the plane , and I witnessed a scene where a passenger had tried to embarrass himself before his number had been called , and I watched the gate agent that treated that man as if he had broken the law , like a criminal .
She was blamed for trying to embark on a group before her .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you treat us as animals ?
Why don &apos;t you treat us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And the agent answered me exactly like this .
He said , &quot; &quot; Lord , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could end up in trouble or lose the work . &quot; &quot; All he was communicating was that he didn &apos;t feel secure . Everything he was communicating to me .
It &apos;s that he doesn &apos;t trust his leaders .
The reason we fly with Southwest Airlines is not because they hire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
You see , if conditions are wrong , we are forced to expand our time and our energy to protect ourselves from others , and that in itself makes the organization weak .
When we feel safe in the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our forces and we will work instantly to cope with dangers outside and cheat opportunity .
The most pervasive analogy that comes to mind for a great leader , is a parent .
If you think about what it means to be a good parent , what do you want ? What does a good parent do ?
Our children want to give opportunities , education , shout them if they need to , all to make them grow and achieve important milestones than we &apos;ve achieved .
Great leaders want exactly the same things .
They want to give opportunities , education , test if you need to , claim self-esteem , give the opportunity to try and fail , all to get better outcomes than the ones you imagine for yourself .
Charlie Kim , the CEO of the Next Jump company in New York , a technology company , argues that if you spent hard time in your family , would you ever consider the idea of licking one of your children ?
You would never do that .
So why do we take into account the idea of licensing the staff in the company ?
Charlie implemented a life job policy .
If you &apos;re hired in Next Jump , you can &apos;t be fired for return issues .
In fact , if you have problems , they &apos;ll teach you and they &apos;ll give you support , just like we would do if one of our children brings home a bad school vote .
It &apos;s the exact opposite .
That &apos;s why so many people experience visceral hatred , anger , to bankers who have wages and bonus disproportionate .
It &apos;s not numbers .
It &apos;s the fact that we &apos;ve violated the definition of leadership itself .
They violated this root contract in society .
We know that they have allowed their people to be sacrifice so that they can protect their interests , or worse , they sacrifice their people to protect their interests .
That &apos;s what offers us so much , not the numbers .
Would anyone offend if we gave a 150 million dollar prize to Gandhi ?
And one of 250 million to Mother Teresa ?
Do we have any problems ? Nothing at all . Nothing at all .
Big leaders would never sacrifice .
People to save numbers .
They like to sacrifice numbers to save people .
Bob Chapman , who runs a great manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 , was hit hard by the recession , and the company lost 30 percent of the orders from one day to another .
Now , in a big manufacturing company , it &apos;s a hard hit , and they couldn &apos;t afford their employees &apos; team anymore .
They had to save 10 million dollars , like so many other companies today , the advice came together and talked about licensing .
And Bob refused .
See , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in the number of people .
Bob believes in the number of hearts , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce the number of hearts .
And so they came up with a license program .
Every employee , from the secretary to the CEO , had to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
They could take them when they wanted to , and they didn &apos;t have to take all four together .
But it was like Bob announced the program that matters .
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s better that we all suffer a little bit rather than allowing some of us to suffer a lot , &quot; &quot; and the moral has bothered .
They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as they expected , when people feel secure and protected from leadership in society , the natural reaction is to trust and collaborate .
And almost spontaneously , no one would say that , people started to agree with each other .
Those who could afford more would trade with those who could afford less .
Some took five weeks so someone else could just take three of them .
Leadership is a choice . It &apos;s not a rang .
I know a lot of people in the executives of companies who are not for any leader .
They &apos;re authority , and we do what they say because they have an authority on us , but we would never follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are at the lowest corporate levels who have no authority but who are leaders all over and over , because they chose to take care of the person on their left , and they chose to take care of the person on their right .
That &apos;s who a leader is .
I heard a story about some Marines who were in theater and what the Marines consumerism wants , the officer eaten for the last , and he let his men eat first , and when they ended up , he had no food for him .
And when they came back to the battlefield , his men brought him his food so that he could eat , because that &apos;s how things go .
We call them leaders because they go first .
We call them leaders because they take risks before anybody else .
They will give us blood , sweat and tears to see their vision of leaders becoming reality , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why from blood , sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; And everybody said , &quot; Why would they do the same thing for me ? &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the kind of company that we all want to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The most complex problems of our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we &apos;re able to dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to switching from dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee who established in the heart of the Andes .
I grew up like this : encouraged to see beyond any limit .
Part of my education involved helping her in remote indigenous communities .
I love those memories because they helped me understand life out of the city ; a life with many possibilities , without barriers , like language or culture .
During those trips , my grandmother used to play a poem by Kipling : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
It goes and looks beyond the mountains .
Something lost beyond mountains .
Things waiting for you . Okay ! &quot; &quot; I became a medical student over the years .
One in a hundred children in the world are born with some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem that I think I can solve — the part of the problem that I &apos;ve been working on for a life .
The problem begins with pregnancy .
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
The survival depends on the communication between systemic and lung blood .
At the moment of birth , this communication has to be interrupted .
If you don &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
It &apos;s caused by genetic conditions and prematurities .
But what we know today is that one of the causes is also the lack of oxygen .
As you can see in the table , the frequency of this kind of hole increases dramatically with altitude .
Video : ( A child crying ) When you look at patients with this disease , they seem to be desperately trying to breathe .
To close the hole , the only solution was high surgery .
One night , my friend Malte and I were camping in the Amazon .
The only thing that didn &apos;t burn in the fire was a green branch of avocado .
Then , an inspiration came .
We used branch as a model for our first invention .
The holes in the hearts of children can be locked with that .
The spiral is a piece of wire wrapped on itself .
You may not seem like a big deal now , but that was our first attempt to create a device for this serious problem .
In this video , we can see how a very small catheter brings the spiral to the heart .
Then the spiral closes the hole .
After the moment of inspiration , a very long period of attempts to develop a prototype .
Research in vitro and alive took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
The spiral , if it works , can save lives .
I went back to Bolivia from Germany , thinking that everywhere we go we have the opportunity to make a difference .
After successfully using our spiral on patients , we were really excited .
But we live in a place at 3,600 meters high .
And patients need a special device to solve their condition .
A ovo in patients on the share is different , because the orphanium between arteries is wider .
Many patients don &apos;t get treated in time and die .
The first spiral was able to solve this problem only half the patients in Bolivia .
The research started again .
We were dot and boss .
After a lot of evidence , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends on the mountains , we got a new device .
We took this traditional textbook method and created a design made of a special material that memorizes shape .
This time it seems like you have to allow us to create a device without joints that doesn &apos;t ruin because it &apos;s made of just one piece .
You can change it alone in very complex structures through a process that &apos;s been developed for decades .
As you can see , the device enters the body through natural channels .
Doctors just have to insert the catheter through the hole .
Our device expands , it positions and closes the hole .
We have this delivery system that &apos;s so simple to use because it works on its own .
You didn &apos;t need to open and operate .
( Applause ) We doctors fight pathologies that require time and commitment to heal — if they heal .
This is the first child , after the procedure .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is embedded , the patient is 100 percent healed .
At the beginning of the end , the whole procedure only takes 30 minutes .
It &apos;s very appealing from a medical and human perspective .
We are so proud that some of our old patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to the narrow interaction with patients working with us .
We all have the same idea : the solution has to be simple .
We &apos;ve lost the fear of creating something new .
The road is not easy .
Many obstacles emerge all the time .
But we get the strength from our patients .
Their resilience and their courage inspires our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not for the cost or for remoteness .
So we need to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
We &apos;re going to give a free device to make sure that every child is treated .
We &apos;re now in many countries , but we need to be everywhere .
All of this started with an impossible idea and will continue , be sure of it . No child will be left behind .
Muchas gracias .

I grew up in the Limpopo , on the border between Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a small country called Motetema .
The water supply and electricity are unpredictable like time , and growing up in this difficult situation , at 17 years old , I was relaxing with a couple of friends during the winter , and we were taking the sun .
The Sun of the Limpopo is very hot in winter .
While we were taking the sun , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t somebody invent something to put on their skin so that they shouldn &apos;t wash up ? &quot; &quot; I was sitting there and I said , &quot; &quot; I would buy it , you know ? &quot; &quot; I went home and did some research , and I found some astonishing statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people around the world don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
450 million are in Africa , and five million are in South Africa .
Several proliferating diseases in this environment , the most drastic one is called tracoma .
The trome is an infection of the eye due to the dirt that goes into the eye . Ripad tracoma infections can make you blind .
These diseases permanently blind eight million people a year , and the shocking thing is that in order to avoid being infected with tracoma , you just wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injection .
So , after seeing these stunning statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , although I don &apos;t do it for me and the fact that I don &apos;t want to go into the bathroom , I have to at least try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , with my own destrian fiber , my Nokia 6234 — I didn &apos;t have a computer and I didn &apos;t have the Internet , I just had a 20-horror Internet now — I did a piece of Google composition .
It looked like the secret spices of KFC , you know ?
I said , perfect , the formula is ready .
Now you have to practice it .
Fast-forward four years , after writing a business plan for 40 pages on the cellphone , after writing my patent on the cellphone , I &apos;m the youngest patent owner in the country , and — ( Nothing more toilet ! ) — I can &apos;t tell you more . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the first loan in the world that replaced the toilet .
You literally put it on your skin and you don &apos;t have to bathe anymore .
( Laughter ) After trying to make it work in high school with limited resources , I went to university , I met a few people , we did some evidence , and we had a product that was ready , perfectly functional to put on the market . Now it &apos;s available on the market .
We learned some lessons in the marketplace , making DryBath available .
One of the things we &apos;ve learned is that poor communities don &apos;t buy in large quantities .
They buy products based on the question . A person like Alex doesn &apos;t buy a cigarette box , buy a cigarette a day , even if it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged DryBath into these little , innovative packets .
They bend in two , they crush .
And the nice thing is that a little bag replaces a toilet for five cops .
By creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of manufacturing .
We realized that even the rich kids in the peripheral neighborhoods wanted absolutely DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million gallons of water every time they replaced a bathroom , and for a kid in rural areas , they were also saving two hours more to spend on school , two hours more to devote their homework , two hours to be just a kid .
After seeing the global impact , we reduced everything to the main value proposal , which is cleaning and convenience .
DryBath is a convenience for rich men and saves life to poor people .
As we &apos;ve experienced the product , we &apos;re now on the verge of selling it to multinational corporations to bring it to the retail to the detail , and one question I &apos;d like to ask the public today is , on the wrong streets of the Limpopo , with a 50-pound paycheck a week , I discovered a way to avoid the world of doing the bathroom .
And you ? What keeps you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
Another key element that I learned in all this process : last year Google selected me among the brilliant young minds in the world .
I &apos;m also the best entrepreneur in the world right now , the first African to get that honoreficiency , and the thing that makes me perplexed is that I did everything because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .

Five years ago , I went to Sabbatical congebra , and I went back to medical school where I studied .
I visited patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , actually , since I became a corporate consultant .
Two things surprised me in that month .
The first was that the common theme of discussions was hospital budgets and cost cuts , and the second thing , which really bothered me , was that many colleagues I met , former medical faculty , which I knew was one of the brightest , most motivated , involved and passionate ones I &apos;d ever met , had become cynical , disgusted , and had taken distances from the hospital administration .
With this attention to cutting costs , I wondered if we weren &apos;t forgetting the patient .
Many of the countries that you represent and where I come from are struggling with health costs .
They represent a big slice of national budgets .
And many different reforms among them are sometimes limiting this increase .
In some countries , there &apos;s a long time of waiting for surgery .
In other countries , new drugs are not repaid , so they don &apos;t get to patients .
In many countries , doctors and nurses are , in a way , the target of governments .
After all , health spending decisions are made by doctors and nurses .
You pick an expensive test , you choose to operate a fragile and old patient .
So limiting the degree of freedom of physicians is a way to contain costs .
Finally , today some doctors will say that they have no freedom of choice about what is best for their patients .
So it &apos;s not surprising that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
In Boston Consulting Group , we looked at this situation , and we said , this couldn &apos;t be the right way to deal with health .
So we took a step back and asked ourselves , &quot; What are we trying to achieve ? &quot;
Finally , in the healthcare system , we aim to improve patient health , and we need to do that at a limited or sustainable cost .
We call it value-based healthcare .
On the screen behind me , you can see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients in relation to money spent .
This concept was well explained in a 2006 book by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
In this image , you see my mother-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
When we started our research at the BCG , we decided not to look too much at the cost , and to look at the quality , and in research , one of the things that we were most fascinated about was the variations we saw .
When you compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find that some are good , but there are many that are far worse .
The difference was brown .
Erik , my mother-in-law , suffers from prostate cancer , and probably needs surgery .
By living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany where the health care system is very high .
If he goes to Germany and chooses a hospital in the media , he will run a 50 percent risk of becoming incontinent , so he should start using the baby diaper .
Forget a coin . 50 percent risk . That &apos;s a lot .
If he went to Amburgh , in a clinic called Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only 20 percent .
Or you throw a coin , or you run 20 percent risk .
There &apos;s a big difference , seven times as much .
When you look at a lot of hospitals for different diseases , you see huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
Often , the data doesn &apos;t even exist .
Nobody knows .
Going to the hospital is a lottery .
But it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There &apos;s hope .
At the end of the 1970s , a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons came together for the usual annual encounter , to discuss the different procedures they used in hip surgery .
On the left of this slide , you see an assortment of metal , also artificial , used for people who need a new hip .
Each one realized it had its own way to operate .
Everybody argued that their technique was the best , but actually nobody was sure of it , and they loved it .
So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably have to measure the quality so that we know and learn from the best . &quot; &quot; So they spent two years discussing , &quot; What is the quality of hip surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
And eventually they agreed .
Once they agreed , they began to measure and share the data .
Very quickly , they found that by putting concrete in the patient &apos;s bone before they put the head of the metal femur , that would last longer , and many patients would never have to be reoperated in their lives .
They published the data , and it really changed the surgical practice in the country .
Everybody saw that it made a lot of sense .
Since then , they do a publication a year .
Once a year , they post the classic : Who &apos;s the best , who &apos;s the worst ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , so it &apos;s a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , the Swedish surgeons of the hip had the best results in the world , at least those who measured them , and many didn &apos;t .
I found this very passionate principle .
Surgeons come together , agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find out who &apos;s the best , and from that they learn .
I carry on and on .
This is not the only exciting part .
It &apos;s exciting for itself .
But if you put the costs back into the equation , and you look at them , it turns out that those who focused on quality also had the lowest cost , even though initially the goal wasn &apos;t that .
If we look back at the history of hip surgery , a study was done a couple of years ago in which the United States and Sweden were put together .
They tested how many patients needed to be reoperated seven years after the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than Sweden .
So many unnecessary interventions , and a lot of unnecessary suffering for all the patients who had been operating over the course of those seven years .
You can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at the OECD data .
OECD , every once in a while , analyzes the quality of care where it can find data about member countries .
The United States , for many diseases , actually have a quality under the average of the OECD countries .
If the U.S. healthcare system focused more on quality measurement , and increased quality at the OECD average level , it would save Americans 500 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the country &apos;s health care budget .
Some people will say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it doable ?
It would be a paradigm shift for health , and I &apos;m convinced not only that you can do it , but that you have to do .
The change agents are doctors and nurses in the health care system .
During my consulting work , I meet maybe a hundred or more doctors and nurses and other health professionals every year .
The only thing they have in common is that they have a lot of heart what they do in terms of quality for their patients .
Like many of you in the audience , doctors are very competitive .
They were always the best of the class .
We were always the best of the class .
And if someone can prove to them that the outcome they reach for their patients is no better than others , they will do everything they need to improve .
Many of them don &apos;t know .
But doctors have another feature .
They make progress through colleagues &apos; recognition .
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discuss why the other hospital has better outcomes , it &apos;s about sharing .
They &apos;re going to share information about how to improve .
So , it &apos;s measuring and creating transparency , which is a continuous cycle of improvement , which is what this slide shows .
You might say it &apos;s a good idea , but that &apos;s not just an idea .
It actually happens .
We &apos;re creating a global community , a large global community , where we will be able to measure and compare what we do .
Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , the BCG has given birth to what we call ICHOM .
The name sounds like a sneezer , but it &apos;s not . It &apos;s an acronym .
It &apos;s for the International Consortium for the Mission of Sanitary Rights .
We recombine the best doctors and patients to discuss , illness by disease , what quality really is , what should we measure , to create global standards .
They &apos;ve been working — four work groups have been operating in this last year : cataract , back pain , coronaropathy , which is , for example , heart disease and prostate cancer .
The four groups will publish the data in November this year .
It &apos;s the first time we &apos;re going to compare apples with apples , not just within a country , but in different countries .
Next year , we &apos;re predicting to look at eight diseases , next year , 16 .
In three years , we &apos;re predicting to cover 40 percent of the disease .
Compare the apple with the apple . Who &apos;s better ?
Why ?
Five months ago , I held a workshop in the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , who has a vision : to focus the management of my great institution much more on quality , the results that matter to patients .
That particular day , we gathered in a workshop with doctors and nurses and all the staff , discussing leukemia in children .
The group talked about how to measure quality today .
Can we measure it better than how we do it ?
We &apos;ve talked about how we treat these children , what are the important improvements .
We &apos;ve talked about what the costs of these patients are , can we treat them more effectively ?
There was a huge amount of energy in the room .
There have been so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the president of the ward stood up .
He looked at the group and he said — I forgot , first he raised his hand — he raised his hand , punch closed , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . We &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital is doing right now . &quot; &quot; By measuring the value in health , which is not just the costs but the important results for patients , hospitals &apos; staff and the rest of the health care system are no longer going to be a problem , but a big part of the solution .
I think measuring the value of health will lead to a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Ippocrates , which always puts the patient in the middle , would smile from the grave .
Thank you .

I &apos;m excited to share with you some discoveries that really surprised me about what enables companies to be more successful , what are the most important factors for the success of a startup .
You get them to do incredible things .
That &apos;s what I wanted to discover .
I wanted to find out what matters most for the success .
And I wanted to be systematic in my attempt to avoid some of my instincts and perceptions distorted by the many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
I wanted to know this because it &apos;s since I was 12 years old that I started businesses , I sold sweet at the bus stop at high school , solar power devices at college , when I was a speaker .
And after graduation .
We learned a lot from failures .
And I followed these five .
The first one , the idea .
I thought the idea was everything .
My company is called Idealab as much as I love the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; where you get the idea .
And yet , then I started to think that maybe the team , the execution , the adaptability matter even more than the idea .
The customer is the tough reality .
And so I thought maybe the team is the most important thing .
And then I started looking at the business model .
Does the company have a clear path to produce customers &apos; revenue ?
It started to take over my thoughts as an element that determines success .
Then I looked at the funding .
Sometimes companies get big funding .
Is that the most important thing ?
And then , of course , the temple .
Is it too early for an idea and the world is not ready ?
Then , for non-Idealab companies , I looked at the great successes , like Airbnb , Instagram and Uber , YouTube and LinkedIn .
That company came to the culmination of the recession when people needed money , and that maybe pushed people to overcome the fear of renting home to strangers .
But the temple was so perfect for their need for drivers .
The drivers were looking for extra money ; it was very important .
Go.To.com that we announced at TED in 1998 , was at the time when companies were looking for business visits to make traffic .
It was hard to watch online videos , you had to put codec in the browser and a lot of things , and eventually the company closed in 2003 .
However , YouTube didn &apos;t have a business model at the beginning .
They weren &apos;t sure it would work .
So in summary , I would say , execution matters a lot .
The idea matters a lot .
But the timing matters even more .
And the best way to evaluate time is to see if consumers are ready for what you have to offer .
Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a fantastic audience .

I went to school . My expectations were high , I was gently entering the student &apos;s vision made of lectures , parties and wrinkles of road cones .
Under that , I was deeply unhappy , unsafe and essentially terrified — terrified by other people , from the future , from failure and void inside me .
I was leaving a seminar when it started , I was dying and smuggling with the bag like I &apos;d done hundreds of times , when I suddenly heard a voice watching quietly , &quot; He &apos;s leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one , but the clarity and the half of the comment was unambiguous .
&quot; He &apos;s opening the door . &quot;
It was just the beginning . The voice had arrived .
And the voice persisted , days and weeks later , it kept telling everything I was doing in third person .
&quot; He &apos;s going to class . &quot;
It was neutral , it was dough , and after a while , even strangely friendly and reassuring , although I noticed that sometimes it would escape the external calm and occasionally reflected my inexpressive emotions .
For example , if I was angry and I had to hide it , which I often did , as an expert in hiding my feelings , then the voice seemed frustrated .
A subjective process had begun : the implication that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I felt it meant something was wrong at all .
For a while , I told the doctor at the university .
To be honest , I was desperately searching for interest and help , and I started telling my strange commenter .
For example , I was part of a student television emitter who was transmitting news on campus , and during a sitting that she was doing late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry doctor , I have to go .
At this point , events began to take over .
He followed a hospital recession , the first of many , followed the diagnosis of schizophrenia , and then , the worst thing , a tremendous sense of mistrust , humiliation and desperation for myself and my perspectives .
But being encouraged to see the voice not as an experience , but as a symptom , fear and resistance intensified .
Basically , it meant having an aggressive attitude towards my mind , a kind of psychological civil war , and that caused an increase in the number of voices that progressively became hostile and threatening .
Do you see that glass of water ?
He had established a vicious cycle of fear , elusion , mistrust and inunderstanding , and it &apos;s a battle where I let myself engage , impotent and unable to establish any kind of peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , deterioration was dramatic .
At that point , I had all the repertoire of the delusion : terrifying voices , cave visions , bizarre illusions , uncurable illusions .
When you think about the disaster and the despair of those years , it &apos;s as if someone had died in that place , while someone else was saving .
A weak and spectral person started that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would become a person I was destined to be .
Many people wound me in life , and I remember them all , but the memories become tender and blurry compared to the people who helped me .
I think Eleanor can overcome this .
Sometimes it snows until the month of May , but last summer or then it always comes . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes are not enough to express recognition to all those good , generous people who fought next to me and for me and waited to see me coming back from that lonely and agony place .
At first , it was hard to believe , not least because voices seemed so hostile and threatening , so in this sense , a first vital step was to learn to separate a metaphorical meaning from what I had previously interpreted as truth in literal sense .
So for example , the voices that threatened to attack my home , I learned to interpret them as my sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than being real , endangered .
At first , I believed it .
I remember , for example , I was sitting at a cutting-edge night outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a real threat of voices .
I would say things like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give me a shot .
I have a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Taptic .
It was armed with this awareness that I eventually reconstructed my being fragmented , every piece represented by a different voice , I gradually removed all the medicines , and I returned to the psychiatrist , but this time on the other side .
Now I &apos;m proud to be part of Intervoice , the organizing body of the International Committee Movement of Voice , an initiative inspired by Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , who identifies voices as a survival strategy , a healthy reaction to crazy circumstances ; not as a horror of schizophrenia to bear , but a meaningful experience to explore .
This kind of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already beginning to happen .
To paraphrase Chavez , once it started , social change is not reversible .
You can &apos;t humiliate people who feel proud .
You can &apos;t oppress people who are no longer afraid .
Over the last 20 years , the Movement of Voice Udators has introduced a network of auditors of voices in 26 countries of five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity , and empowerment for individuals with mental problems , to create a new language and to convey hope , which , in deep , has a tremendous faith in the power of individuals .
As Peter Levine says , the human animal is one that has an intact capacity to treat and spirit of exploitation of this innate capacity .
In that sense , for the members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege of facilitating this process of healing someone , to testify , to hold their hand , to share the weight of somebody &apos;s suffering , and to keep the hope of recovery alive .
We &apos;re unique . We &apos;re unreplaceable .
What we have inside can never really be colonized , counted , or taken away .
Light never turns off .
As a wonderful doctor once said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people say to you .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photograph .
But is it photography ?
I ask this because , of course , it &apos;s not a photograph you can do with a camera .
My interest in photography was born with my first digital machine at the age of 15 .
He crossed my previous passion for drawing , but it was a little different because using the camera , the key process was in planning .
And when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up pressing the shot button .
It made me feel like photography was more a matter of being in the right place at the right time .
I felt like anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process started at the moment of the shot .
Foto like this : working in a busy street .
But it has something unexpected .
And yet , it keeps a dose of realism .
Or pictures like this , both dark and colorful , but all with the common goal to maintain a dose of realism .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually photograph , but I always want them to feel like they &apos;re kind of like real boxes .
I &apos;m going to take you a few moments to understand the trick .
So it &apos;s more a way to capture an idea than to capture a moment .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes them look realistic ?
Is it something in detail or colors ?
Something about light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes illusion is perspective .
But ultimately , everything depends on how we interpret the world and how we can represent it on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what &apos;s realistic , but what we think it looks like realistic .
I think the basics are pretty simple .
For me , it &apos;s just like a puzzle of reality that you can take different texts and combine them to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something that we can all associate with a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a way , they can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brain because this simply cannot accept that actually the object doesn &apos;t make any sense .
I see the same process in combining photographs .
It &apos;s always about combining different reality .
The things that give the picture a realistic aspect , I think , are the things that we don &apos;t even think of , the things that are around us all the time .
But when you combine the pictures , it &apos;s very important to see , because otherwise it seems like something doesn &apos;t square .
I would say there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic result .
As you can see , these pictures are nothing special .
But combine can create something like this .
The first rule is that combinations should have the same perspective .
The second , photos should have the same kind of light .
And these two pictures have these two requirements , taken from the same height and with the same light .
The third rule is to make it impossible to tell where the different images start and end , making it fluid .
It makes it impossible to understand how the image was made .
Armonizing color , contrast and brightness where the different images come together , adding photographic flaws as depth of field , desibrated colors and noise , we can erase the edges between the different images and make it look like a single one , despite the fact that an image can hold hundreds of levels in practice .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) You might think it &apos;s just a picture of a landscape and that manipulation is the lower part .
But this picture is actually made up of different places .
And I personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place to excavate it , so you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas that we have in mind .
But you need accurate planning .
Having had this idea during the winter , I knew I had many months to organize , to find the different location for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was photographed while I was fishing .
Rives come from different locations .
The underwater part was photographed in a stone oven .
And yes , I even colored the house on the island of red to give her a more Swedish look .
So , to get a realistic result , it &apos;s all about planning .
It always starts with a drawing , an idea .
And then it &apos;s about combining the different pictures .
And here every piece is very well-planned .
If you do a good job taking pictures , the result can be very beautiful and also remarkably realistic .
Now , shipping tools are available , the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

&#91; On April 3 , 2016 , there was the biggest news escape in history &#93; &#91; The Panama Papers showed rich , powerful people &#93; &#91; to hide large , offshore accounts &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness &#93; This week , there was a real , true valangue of stories unleashed by a 11 million papers from a legal study by Mossom named Fossom .
The spread of these documents reveals only a small piece of the secret world of offshore accounts .
We can see how private customers , banks and lawyers go from studies like Mossack Fonseca and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we want an anonymous company , can you give them one ? &quot; &quot; You can actually read email , text exchanges , the mechanics behind that , how this works .
Now , there have been some pretty immediate repercussion already .
The Icelandic Prime Minister gave missions .
We &apos;ve come to know that even a brutal dictator Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has offshore societies .
It was mentioned by a two-billion-dollar track that led to the Russian President Vladimir Putin through his dear childhood friend , who is also a famous cello .
And out there , there will be a lot of rich individuals and others who will be agitated thinking about the next set of stories and the next flight of documents .
Well , it looks like the plot of a spy thriller or a novel by John Grisham .
It looks very far from normal people like you and me .
Why should we care ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful characters can hide their money overseas , without paying taxes that show them , it means there will be less money for basic public services like health , education , street maintenance .
And this is about all of us .
Now , for my organization Global Witness , this revelation was phenomenal .
We hear global media and political leaders talk about how some individuals can use offshore accounts to hide and masking their goods , a problem we &apos;ve been talking about and show for 10 years .
It seems to me that a lot of people consider this disconcerting world and can &apos;t figure out how this kind of offshore world works .
I like to describe it as a kind of matrioska .
So you can imagine a society locked inside another society locked inside another society again , so that it becomes almost impossible to understand who &apos;s behind these structures .
It can be very difficult for the sculpture , or the whistle , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
It also seems interesting to me that there &apos;s been less media coverage in the United States .
And maybe it &apos;s because there hasn &apos;t been a lot of American personalities in these revelations , in this scandal .
Now , that doesn &apos;t mean that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their foreign goods .
Rather , because of how the offshore system works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers .
If it was a news escape from the Cayman Islands , or even from Delaware , from Wyoming or Nevada , you would hear a lot more cases and examples related to Americans .
In fact , in various American states , they require less information , you have to provide less information to establish a society than to make a library card .
This reservation in the United States has allowed school employees to derubate their kids .
It allowed fraudsters to derubate vulnerable investors .
This kind of practice affects all of us .
And here in Global Witness , we wanted to see how this happens in reality .
How does it work ?
What we did was we sent an investigator from 13 legal studies in Manhattan .
Our investigator ended up with an African minister who wanted to transfer suspicious funds to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
Now , the really shocking thing is that all those lawyers except one gave advice to our investigator to transfer those suspicious funds .
They were all preliminary meetings , we didn &apos;t hibit any of those lawyers , and of course there was no money around it , but already from here you see the problem of this system .
Also , it &apos;s important not to look at these as isolated cases .
It &apos;s not about a single lawyer who talked to our investigator by giving them suggestions .
It &apos;s not about a political leader in particular at the center of a scandal .
We talk about how a system works , which strengthen corruption , tax evasion , poverty , instability .
And to counter that , we have to change the game .
We need to change the rules of play to make these practices harder .
The situation may seem hopeless to you because there &apos;s nothing you can do , because nothing has ever changed , because there will always be rich and powerful characters .
But I &apos;m optimistic , and I see that there &apos;s some change going on .
In the last two years , we &apos;ve seen a real drive towards greater transparency in the constitution of society .
The question was added to the political agenda by the first British minister David Cameron to a G8 summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union has decided to create central registries at the national level of those who have and control societies in Europe .
What &apos;s sad is that the United States has remained behind .
There &apos;s a bipartisan law , which was introduced to the House and the Senate , but it &apos;s not giving the results we hoped .
And we &apos;d really like the Panama Papers , this great beer inside the offshore world , to be used to step up in the United States and around the world .
For us of Global Witness , this is the moment of change .
We need normal people to arrive for the way people can hide their identity behind secret societies .
We need entrepreneurs to stand up and say , &quot; This reservation is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and they &apos;re committed to changing the law to break this recklessness .
Together , we can change the recklessness that is allowing fiscal evasion to corruption , money laundering to thrive .
Chris Anderson : Welcome Julian .
It &apos;s said that Wikileaks , your creature , has — over the last few years made more media documents classified than the whole world combined .
Is that possible that &apos;s true ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , how does it actually be ?
It &apos;s troubling — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the media around the world is working so bad that a small group of activists can publish a lot more information than this kind of the rest of the world &apos;s press put together .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people distribute documents ?
And how do you ensure that privacy ?
JA : These are — for what we understand — classic &quot; &quot; blow . &quot; &quot; And we have various ways to get information there .
We use state-of-the-art cryptography to make the material bounce on the Internet , cover traces , go through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to heal these legal protections .
We get the information through the mail the ordinary , cryptography or not , we verify how regional information agencies do , we train them what is sometimes very difficult to do , when it comes to gigantic databases of information — we distribute them to the public and then defend against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
CA : So you try to ensure that documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know the source identity .
JA : Yeah , yeah . Very rarely we know , and if we come to know it , we destroy that information as soon as possible .
( Plumps ) . Disease .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the CIA that asks what the code is to associate with TED . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s take a real example .
This is something you drill a few years ago .
If we can have the document on the screen ...
This was a story a few years ago in Kenya .
Can you tell us what you revealed and what happened ?
JA : It &apos;s the Kroll report .
A secret services report on demand for the Kenyota government after the election of 2004 .
Before 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for 18 years .
He was a blinding dictator in Kenya .
And when Kibaki went to power — mediating a coalition of forces trying to clear Kenya from corruption — ordered this inquest , two million pounds on this and on other related inks .
And then the government put it aside and used it to influence politically Moi , which was the richest man — and it &apos;s still in Kenia .
It &apos;s the Sacro Graal of Kenyan journalism .
So I went to Kenya in 2007 , and I was able to get the documents just before the election — the national elections of December 28 .
When we published the inquiry , we did it three days after the new president Kibaki decided to become a friend of the man who was about to heal , Daniel arap Moi , so this inquest became a mortal burden for President Kibaki .
CA : And to cut a long story short — the news of the inquiry drove into Kenya , not from official media , but indirectly . And , you know , he actually broke the voting .
JA : Yeah , it was the first page of the Guardian , and then it was published in the surrounding countries of Kenya , the printing press in Tanzania and South Africa .
And so he came from the outside .
And this , after a few days , made the Kenyan press feel secure to be able to speak about it .
And he talked about Kenyan TV for 20 nights in a row , and he moved the vote 10 percent , depending on a Kenyan service report , which changed the electoral result .
CA : Wow , so your breath really changed the world ?
Ja : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : Here we go — let me show you a short excerpt from this video of an airborne incursion on Baghdad .
The video is longer . But here &apos;s a short excerpt .
It &apos;s — I warn you — very strong material .
Radio : ... very good , when you &apos;re up there , you fake it out .
I see your element , ah , I have four Humvees , ah , along the way .
Go . Good . Fire .
Let me know when you caught them . Fire .
You make it all out .
Come on , fire !
( Thumping ends ) It keeps shooting . It keeps shooting . ( Breaking ends ) It keeps shooting .
Hotel — Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six .
We have to move now !
Well , we just cheated all eight individuals .
Yes , you see two of them , and we &apos;re still shooting .
Got it . Got it .
Two-Six , here Two- Six , we &apos;re moving .
Oops , sorry . What happened ?
Maledition , Kyle . Well , hahaha . I struck them .
CA : How did this impact ?
JA : The impact on people who worked on it was heavy .
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to do more research on this story .
This is just the first of three attacks that happened on this scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right ? including two Reuters employees ?
JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two small children were injured .
There have been between 18 and 26 people killed in total .
CA : And the publication of this movie caused a lot of outrage .
What was the key element that actually caused the outrage , in your opinion ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I guess people are able to see the enormous inequality of forces .
There are people walking peacefully on the street , and then an Apache helicopter hidden in a corner shooting bullets from 30 millimeters on everyone — looking for any excuse to do that — and killing people who see injuries .
And two journalists were involved that were clearly not surprising , because that &apos;s a full-time job .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. service analyst , Bradley Manning , who &apos;s been arrested , and it &apos;s said he confessed in a &quot; &quot; chat &quot; &quot; net that he &apos;d filmed this video at Wikileaks along with 280,000 U.S. Embassy communications .
I mean , did he do that ?
JA : So we denied getting those messages .
It was accused , about five days ago , of getting 150,000 communications and posted 50 .
Now , we published in the beginning of the year a U.S. Embassy communication in Reykjavk , but there &apos;s not necessarily a link .
I mean , I was a well-known visitor of that Embassy .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve received thousands of diplomatic communications from the U.S. Embassy ...
JA : We would make it public . ( CA : Really ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) JA : Well , why do these things reveal the reality of , say , what are Arab governments , and the real abuses of human rights in this government ?
If you look at the communications that are declassified , this is the kind of material that they have .
CA : Let &apos;s talk more generally about that .
I mean , in general , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it fair to encourage people to suffer from secret information ?
JA : Well , the question is what kind of information is important for the world what kind of information is able to achieve reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So the information for which organizations make financial efforts to keep them hidden indicates very clearly that when that information comes out , there &apos;s hope that it &apos;s good , because organizations who know it , that everyone knows everything is spending on to keep it secret .
And this is what we found in practice , and this is the story of journalism .
CA : But isn &apos;t there any risk that , for direct stakeholders or even for society in its together , can suffers really have unintended consequences ?
JA : Never seen anything like that with the material that we published .
I mean , we have a badly immunization policy .
We have a way of treating information that has something personal — information that can identify a person .
But there are legitimate secrets — let &apos;s say , medical data , this is a legitimate secret , but we treat with those who pass through the ceiling who are really motivated .
CA : So they &apos;re very motivated .
And what would you say , for example , to a parent — whose son is serving in the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you published something that has a second end .
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing in front of people who die .
This is from the impression that — it impression millions of people around the world that the U.S. military are divine people .
But that &apos;s not the case . My son is not like this . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say ?
JA : Yeah , we have a lot of these examples .
But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So the video is not going to change their opinion , it &apos;s not going to change their perception .
This is what they see every day .
It &apos;s going to change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you &apos;ve found a way to put light into what you see as all of these inconfessable secrets in companies and governments .
Light is good .
But don &apos;t you see the irony that , to get that light shining , should you also create secrecy on your sources ?
JA : Not really . I mean , we haven &apos;t had any dissidents in Wikileaks yet .
We don &apos;t have sources that are dissident about other sources .
If this happened , it would be a very complicated situation for us , but presumably , we act so that people feel morally compelled to continue the mission , not compromise it .
CA : I would actually be interested , based only on what I &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious to have the TED audience &apos;s opinion .
You know , there can be a couple of views on Wikileaks and Julian .
You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — carrying this important light .
Periculous fomentator , agitator .
Who sees it as a hero ?
Who like a dangerous agitator ?
JA : Come on . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a mite audience , Julian , a mite audience .
We need to try better . Let &apos;s put them in front of another example .
Here &apos;s something you haven &apos;t published yet , but you &apos;re about to publish for TED .
I mean , it &apos;s an intriguing story that just happened , right ?
What is this about ?
JA : This is an example of what we do , pretty much every day .
At the end of last year — last November — there were a series of wells in Albania like the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we got an inquest — sort of a technical analysis of what happened — that said that the jurred oil companies and competitors actually park trucks and had them jump .
And that part of the Dutch government was implicated , etc .
And the technical relationship had no title or intestation , and it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t test it because we didn &apos;t know who made it and what it was .
So we were skeptical , and we thought maybe a rival oil company was doing its games .
With this assumption , we made it public , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical compared to this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , the sensation is that it &apos;s good but we can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And so we got a letter just this week from the company that made it successful , who wants to go back to the bloodline — ( Laughter ) which says , &quot; &quot; Hei , we want to track the source . &quot; &quot; So we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is that ?
Can you prove that you have legal authority on that document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screenshot with the author and his identity to Microsoft Word .
Yeah .
( Applause ) So many things happen .
This is one of our methods to identify — to test what material it is , let &apos;s try to make sure that they write a letter to us .
CA : Yeah . Have you had information from the inside of the BP ?
JA : Yeah , a lot , but , let &apos;s say , at the moment , we &apos;re doing some kind of fundraising effort and technology .
So the publishing rate in the last few months has been said to be reduced to the minimum as we retrofit our feedback systems because of the phenomenal interest in the public .
It &apos;s a problem .
That is , like any organization at the exorts that &apos;s growing up , we &apos;re kind of overwhelmed by our own growth , and that means that there are huge amounts of soft and revelations of very high calibro , but we don &apos;t have enough personal enough to examine and to wash that information .
CA : So here &apos;s the main bottleneck in simple words : voluntary journalists and / or the funding for journalists ?
JA : Yeah . Of course , and trust people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s not easy to grow up fast for the kind of material that we treat , so we need to rebuild in order to have people who manage the national security stuff at the highest level , and then the lower security cases .
CA : Help us understand something about you , your person and how you got to this .
And I think I &apos;ve read that you as a child have been in 37 different schools .
Is that possible ?
JA : So my parents worked in the movies and then they were out of a sword , and so the whole set of two things ...
( Laughter ) CA : A psychologist might say it &apos;s a formula for paranoid .
JA : What , the movie industry ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you &apos;ve also been — you &apos;ve also been a very young hacker , and you &apos;ve had to deal with authority as a young man .
JA : I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young activist journalist at a very early age .
I wrote a magazine , I was processed for that magazine when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with the term &quot; hackers &quot; &quot; expression .
I mean , it &apos;s a method — there &apos;s a method that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately at the moment , it &apos;s mainly used by the Russian mafia to steal the bank account of grandmothers .
So expression is not — it &apos;s not as pleasant as it was time .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing from the bank of any nonnetworking , but what about your fundamental values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe an episode of your life that has contributed to determining them ?
JA : I couldn &apos;t point out a particular event .
But the fundamental values , the capable , generous men don &apos;t create victims ; they care about victims .
And this is something that comes to me from my father and other capable and generous men who have been part of my life .
CA : Happy , generous men don &apos;t create victims ; do they kill victims ?
JA : Yeah . And , you know , I &apos;m a fighter person , so I &apos;m not very good when it comes to acknowledging , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of noticing the victims , which is vigilating the accountants of the crime .
And so this is something that &apos;s been part of my personality for a long time .
CA : Tell us now , very quickly in the last minute , the story of what happened in Iceland ?
You basically published something there , there were problems with a bank , and then the information services there had the union of not publishing .
On the contrary , they gave visibility to your side .
It made you a character of spicy in Iceland . And then what ?
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s a great case , you know .
Iceland crossed this financial crisis .
It was hit harder than any other country in the world .
The banking industry was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
So , we publish this question in July last year .
And on national television comes the junction five minutes before the transmission . As in a movie , the junction came to the desk of the editor and the journalist says something like , &quot; Never happened . What to do ? &quot;
Well , let &apos;s show you the image of the website , instead of the news all the time , as reemptive . And so we became very famous in Iceland , and we went to Iceland and and talked about the issue .
And there was a sense in the community that these things never had to happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and other international experts , we put together a kind of legislative package for Iceland that became a kind of a White press harbor with the most powerful journalists in the world , with a Nobel Prize for freedom of press .
Iceland is a North country , and so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to access the system .
And just a month ago , it was approved by the Icelandic parliament to unanimity .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) One last question , Julian .
When you think about the future , then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be the advent of a Big Brother that has more control , more secrecy , or do we see on the Great Brother , or is it all to play ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure how it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there are huge pressures to harmonize legislation in fact of freedom of expression and legislation of transparency in the world — within the European Union , between China and the United States .
Where are you going ? It &apos;s hard to understand .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s very interesting to live right now , because in striving a little bit , we can move things from one side or another .
CA : Well , I think I can interpret the public &apos;s opinion by saying , Julian , you &apos;re careful and you can do it .
JA : Thank you Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel incredibly lucky to belong to a general country as the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven , women in Iceland did a strike .
They didn &apos;t work that day , whether they were a professional or a housewife .
They marched all the way to the center of Reykjavk , and he Partecuted 90 percent of the women , peacefully and with the spirit of solidarity they asked equality .
Everything stopped that day in Iceland , because nothing works when women are not at work .
( Applause ) Five years later , Icelandic had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratically elect a woman as president .
I will never forget that day , in which President Vigdesss as we know her with her name of battling , rushed from her house balcony , single mother with a daughter next to her as an election winner .
( Applause ) This woman was a role model for me , and for all those who grew up at that time , including males .
She often tells the story of when she was approached by a kid after a couple of mandates and asked her , &quot; &quot; Can boys really grow up to become president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So behavior models are really important , but despite these very strong models that I am grateful for , when I was encouraged to run as president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I going to run as president ?
Who am I to be president ? apparently , women are less likely to run for men .
A U.S. study conducted in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men thought they were going into politics against 45 percent of women .
This is a 16-percentile gap , and it &apos;s the same gap that existed a decade before .
And it &apos;s really a shame , because I &apos;m really convinced that the world needs women leaders and more leadership based on principles in general .
So my decision to run is fundamentally derived from having felt that I had to give my contribution despite having no political experience , to keep me going and be part of creating a world that made sense and was sustainable for our children , a world where we can allow our kids and girls to be anything they can be .
And this was the journey of my life .
It was wonderful .
The journey started with about 20 candidates .
He reduced to nine qualified candidates , and eventually we ran in four , three men and I .
( Applause ) But the drama doesn &apos;t stop there .
You think the real drama is in America , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can assure you that we had our drama in Iceland .
The then chairman in charge for 20 years announced initially that he wouldn &apos;t be recharged , which perhaps started a lot of candidates .
Later he changed his mind , when our prime minister gave the missions because of the case &quot; &quot; Panama Papers &quot; &quot; where he and his family were involved .
There was a popular protest in Iceland , and the office president thought that you needed a reliable candidate .
A few days later , relationships on his wife and family companies came out in the Panama Papers , and so he decided to retreat his candidates again .
Before he did that , he said he would do it because now there were two qualified male candidates who estimated how possible successors to his charge .
So May 9 , 45 days before the election , there was no good prospect for me .
I didn &apos;t even appear on the newspaper graph .
The polls gave me one percent , but that was the best candidate woman had ever gotten .
So it &apos;s a tone statement to say that I had to work really hard to find my place and have access to television , because the network decided to only include those with 2.5 percent or more in polls in the first television debate .
I found in the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate alone with three men , and I found it on a television show that I had reached 2.5 percent the day of the television debate .
( Applause ) So , the challenges .
The biggest challenges I &apos;ve faced and overlooked on this journey have been to do with media , muscles and money .
Let &apos;s start with media .
Some people say that gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I don &apos;t think I agree .
I had more difficulty getting access and time available in the media .
There &apos;s evidence that the leader candidate appeared in transmissions 87 times in the next few months in the elections , and I appeared 31 times .
And I &apos;m not saying that media makes it consciously .
I think it &apos;s often an unconscious bias , because in media , like elsewhere , you can find conscious and unconscious bias , and we have to find the courage to talk about it if we want to change it .
When I finally got access to TV , the first question they asked me was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to leave ? &quot; &quot; It was a difficult question .
But of course , with polls from one percent to 2.5 percent , maybe it &apos;s understandable .
But media is important , and every time I showed up on TV , we saw our consensus rise in the polls , so I know for direct experience how important it is and why we need to talk about it .
I was the only person in the four candidates who hadn &apos;t had an interview on the front page .
Sometimes I &apos;ve been asked about questions asked by all other candidates and outside of the media attention .
I faced this , but I still have to complain to the Icelandic media .
I had almost no comment on my packaging and dress .
( Applause ) So glory to them .
But there &apos;s another experience that &apos;s just as important .
I ran as an independent , without any party or political force on my side .
This lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably had its own weight on our campaign , but it allowed us to innovate and make policy differently .
We did a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of elections for others .
A possible reason why I had less space on television , because I wanted to show you respect for other candidates .
After confirming how hard access to the media was , we used our own .
I made live sessions on Facebook where I got questions about every topic and responded directly to .
We put all the questions and answers to Facebook because we thought transparency was important if you want to create trust .
And when it turned out to be complicated to reach younger voters , I became a Snapchatter .
I took young people who taught me , and I used all the Snapchat filters during the last part of the campaign .
And I had to use a lot of humor and humility , because I was really bad .
Because of that , we grew consent among young people .
So you can run a different election campaign .
But unfortunately , we can &apos;t talk about politics without mention money .
I &apos;m sorry that &apos;s the case , but it &apos;s the truth , and we &apos;ve had less economic resources than other candidates .
This may be partly because I think I &apos;ve had more difficulty requesting financial support .
And maybe even because I had the ambition that I could do more with less .
Some people will say that it &apos;s my typically feminine thing .
But even with a third of the media , a third of the financial resources , and a team of only entrepreneurial but wonderful , we were able to surprising all night of the election , when the first data came .
I surprised myself , as you can see from the picture .
( Laughter ) Here are the first numbers . I was head with the main candidate .
( Cheers ) Well , too early , but I didn &apos;t do it . I got to second . We had come a long way from that one percent to about a third of the votes , and we broke the polls with an unprecedented margin : 10 percentage points compared to the last polls .
So some people called me the true elections winner , and many people encouraged me to run again .
The thing that makes me more proud is to know that I &apos;ve achieved a percentage of greater consensus from young people and many people have asked my daughter to present in 2040 .
( Applause ) She &apos;s 13 years old , and she &apos;s never been on TV before .
The election day , I watched it on TV repeatedly . She was awake and confident of herself , sincere and supporting her mother .
This was perhaps the culmination of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
Audience : Oh !
This image was basically a victory for me .
What we see is what we can be .
It educates fear and challenges .
( Applause ) It &apos;s important that women are willing to do and run for a pole , whether it &apos;s Amministrator Delegata or the presidential office .
I &apos;ve also managed to leave a sign on your &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve earned a new title , &quot; &quot; a living emoji of sincerity . &quot; &quot; ( Cheering ) It &apos;s perhaps the title I &apos;m most proud of right now , and the reason is that women are too often penalized because they use what I call their emotional capital , but I know for the experience that we become really good at when we use it .
( Applause ) And we need more .
We celebrated as if we won the election night , because that &apos;s how we felt .
So you don &apos;t necessarily have to get to that office .
But you have to try to conquer it . And you , your family , your friends , and anyone who works with you , if you seriously do , will grow beyond any other past experience .
We &apos;ve had fun , I &apos;ve learned a lot from this journey , maybe a lot more lessons than I can share with you here in the time that we have available .
But keep in mind , it was a hard job .
I &apos;ve lost so many hours of sleep in these months .
It took resilience and perseverance to not let go , but I learned something that I learned earlier , in the day of one percent , which is that things can only be good when you listen in real and authentically to your inner voice and work in sync with it .
As my good sister often says , you can cheat your intuition , but your intuition will never betray you .
I think it &apos;s also very important , and all of you know , any trip you &apos;re on , the team you &apos;re going to bring with you .
Cyrus of people sharing your values , your vision , but they &apos;re different about the rest .
This to me is the formula of success , and I &apos;m fortunate to have a wonderful husband , who is here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we walked together as entrepreneurs in the political arena , and we came up with something that everybody thought was impossible .
In fact , the Public Relations expert told me before I made my decision that I was going to do well , I was going to get seven percent .
I appreciated his perspective because he probably was right , he was based on his precious experience .
But the day of one percent right then , I decided to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s very important to mention it , because I lost many hours of sleep , and I worked hard , as well as others with me .
We can &apos;t go far if we choose to take care of ourselves .
And I think there are two very important things in the process , which is to surround ourselves with people and habits that feed us , but it &apos;s very important , and perhaps even more to have the courage to get rid of people and habits that take energy , including the wonderful bloggers and commentators .
I got a lot of support from others on this issue , and I decided to focus high when others were pointing down , and that &apos;s partly the way I kept energy in the way .
And when I lost my energy for a while — and it happened sometimes , it wasn &apos;t easy — I came back to thinking about why I decided to run and how I decided to compete .
I called it the 4 G campaign , where G represent some Icelandic words .
The first is &quot; &quot; Gagn . &quot; &quot; I ran for good , to be in service , and I wanted a service leadership to be in the center of how I worked with everybody else in the campaign .
The second is &quot; &quot; Gleberi &quot; &quot; or joy .
I decided to enjoy my journey .
There was a lot to learn about the journey , no matter whether the destination was achieved or not .
And I gave the best to inspire others in the same thought .
The third is &quot; &quot; Gagnsaei . &quot; &quot; I was open to every question .
I had no secrets , everything transparent on Facebook and the sites .
Because I think as you choose your president , you deserve answers to your questions .
Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain it to this room , we ran the &quot; &quot; Girl Power &quot; &quot; principle .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m really happy to have had the courage to run me , risking to fail but successful on so many stories .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I also believe that all my team is the same side , which was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I don &apos;t let you go again . Hal Tómóttir : What a wonderful audience . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying .
Maybe everyone in here is ready to move to Iceland and vote for you .
It &apos;s certainly not going to be possible to vote for you , but one thing that we can take from Iceland and that we &apos;ve always taken is inspiration .
And that maybe you don &apos;t know , because our American media didn &apos;t bring it back , the Icelandic women came back on a Monday Square . Right ?
HT : Yeah , that &apos;s it . PM : Can you tell us something about it ?
HT : Yeah , 41 years after the initial strike , we could consider the best place in the world to be women , but the work hasn &apos;t finished .
So at 14 and 38 on Monday , women quit their job , because it was the exact hour they earned the day .
( Applause ) What was really exciting is that young women and men have been participating with more numbers than the past , because it &apos;s time to bridge the retributive divide .
PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask Hal to engage immediately in what he &apos;s going to do next , but I say you have a great army of volunteers if you had to decide to do it again .
Thank you Hal .
HT : Thank you all .
( Applause )
There &apos;s a child watching his father and saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , I want to be the former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I had a great fortune as a former president , because I had the opportunity that very few other people in the world had , to meet many , many people around the world .
I don &apos;t just know the 50 states of the United States , but my wife and I visited over 145 countries and the Carter Center supported full-time programs in 80 countries .
Our global commitment to the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I know it , I can tell you without any means that violation number one of human rights , which is strangely not spoken about , is the abuse of women and girls .
( Applause ) This is true for some reasons I want to talk about , in openness .
First of all , the interpretation of the Bible , the Old Testament , the New Testament , the Koran , etc . These were erroneously played in synagogues , churches and mosques .
They interpret these rules to make women regularly relegated in a secondary position than men in the eyes of God .
It &apos;s a very serious problem that is regularly ignored .
Why should I pay them a salary equal to the same kind of work ?
The other very serious point that causes this problem is the excessive use of violence , which is growing strangely in the world .
In the United States of America , for example , we &apos;ve had a huge increase in abuse on poor people , mostly black and minorities , who are locked in prison .
When I was a governor in Georgia , one in 1,000 Americans was in prison .
Today , 7.3 people out of 1,000 are in prison .
The number went up seven times .
We &apos;re also one of the few countries in the civilian world that still has death penalty .
Now we &apos;re in California , the other day I learned that California spent four billion dollars on the 13-person death sentence .
In fact , in California , the expenditure to perform a death sentence is worth 307 million dollars .
One is genital mutilation .
Genital mutilation is horrible and unknown to American women , but in some countries , in many countries , when a female is born , rather soon in her life , her genitals are completely reviewed with a kind of cut that has a blade of rasoe and is not sterilized . They remove her external parts of female genitals .
Then , when you marry , the same cut opens up the orphanium so that he can have sex .
It &apos;s not a rare practice , although it &apos;s illegal in many countries .
In Egypt , for example , 91 percent of the females living in today &apos;s Egypt was sexually mutilated like that .
In some countries , more than 98 percent of women are mutilated that way before they achieve maturity .
It &apos;s a terrible struggle for all the women who live in those countries .
This is committed by members of his own family , so the family becomes murderers when the girl takes to the family the so-called misfortune .
Another problem that we have in the world that is linked to women , is slavery , which is now called human trafficking .
Today there are 30 million people living in slavery .
The State Department of the United States got Congress a mandate to stilate an annual report , and the State Department reports that 800,000 people have been sold as slaves across international borders every year and that 80 percent of those are women , sold as slaves of sex .
Right now in the United States , 60,000 people live in slavery .
In Atlanta , Georgia , where Carter Center sat and I teach Emory University 200-300 women to be sold as slaves every month .
It &apos;s the main location in which this happens .
If the tenutary of a bag wants to buy a brown or black carnage girl , she can do it for 1,000 dollars .
A white girl is worth a lot more , the tenutary of a common bags in Atlanta , and in the United States , she can earn about 3,000 dollars a slave .
This is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there &apos;s no scholarship in America that &apos;s not known by local officials , local police officers , police officers , or mayor and so on .
Sweden had a good approach .
About 15 or 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted because they are in the state of sexual slavery , they are prosecuted instead the tenutary of the bags , the protectors and the clients , ( Applause ) and the prostitution has calmed .
In the United States , for every man who &apos;s arrested for illegal sexual transaction , 25 women are arrested .
And this is another thing you could do .
In the military , they &apos;re looking at how many sexual aggressions they take place .
In the last report I got was about 26,000 sexual attitudes that took place in the military , 26,000 .
Only 3,000 , not more than one percent , are actually prosecuted , and the reason is that the officer in command of every organization is a ship like my submarine , or a battalion of the Army or a Marine company , the command officer has the right to decide whether to pursue a violator or not , and of course , the last thing they want is somebody to know that under their command they &apos;re not committed to it .
Law has to be changed .
One out of four girls entering American universities will have a sexual assault before graduation , now this is news , partly through my book among other things , and so 89 universities in America have been convicted by the Department of Education according to the Title IX because college officials don &apos;t care about women by protecting them from sexual aggressions .
The Justice Department says that more than half of the violence on college campus is perpetrated by serial rapers , because outside the university system , if they raped someone would be prosecuted , but when they get to college campus .
They &apos;re not prosecuted .
This is the kind of thing that happens in our society .
When I became president , it was 39 percent .
We &apos;ve made some progress , partly because I &apos;ve been president — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) but in the last 15 years , we haven &apos;t made progress , so the difference is still 23 to 24 percent in the last 15 years .
This is the kind of thing that happens .
If you take the first 500 companies according to Fortune only 23 have a female CEO of 500 , and those CEOs , I tell you , make less money on average than the other CEOs .
This is what happens in our country .
Another problem in the United States is that we are the world &apos;s most warrior nation .
We &apos;ve been in war with 25 countries since World War II .
Sometimes we had soldiers fighting on the ground .
Other times , of course , we have today .
There have been four years , I &apos;m not going to tell you which , where we haven &apos;t been , ( Applause ) We haven &apos;t shot bullets .
However , these kinds of things , the recession to violence and the bad interpretation of the sacred scripts are the causes , the fundamental causes .
But there &apos;s another primary cause , and you don &apos;t need to tell you about it , and that &apos;s that , in general , men don &apos;t give up .
( Applause ) It &apos;s true .
Race discrimination , has existed legally for 100 years , since 1865 to the end of the war between states , Civil War , until the 1960s , when Lyndon Johnson passed the law for equal rights .
During this time , there were a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think racial discrimination was right , but they were shut down , because they were enjoying the privilege of better jobs , access to jurisdiction , to better schools , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that happens today , because the average man doesn &apos;t really care .
Even if he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against female discrimination , &quot; &quot; you enjoy the position of privilege .
So what is the most important thing to do today ?
I would say the best thing we can do today is that women of powerful countries like this , and those that you come from , Europe and so on , who have influence , have to take responsibility to ask more force the end of racial discrimination towards women and girls around the world .
The average woman in Egypt has no chapter voice about her daughters being mutilated or anything .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
&quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to dance to the sound of your war drums .
I &apos;m not going to preserve my soul or my bones .
I &apos;m not going to dance at their rhythm .
I know that rhythm .
It has no life .
I know intimately about the skin you hit .
He was alive once , hunted , stolen , stirred .
I &apos;m not going to dance to the sound of the drums of your war .
I &apos;m not going to jump , I &apos;m not going to rotate , I &apos;m not going to be robbing for you .
I &apos;m not going to hate you , and I &apos;m not going to hate you either .
I &apos;m not going to kill you .
At least I will die for you .
I &apos;m not going to celebrate the fruit by killing or killing me .
I &apos;m not going to come with you or dance for bombs just because everyone &apos;s dancing .
Everybody can be wrong .
Life is a right , not collateral or random .
I will not forget where I come from .
I &apos;m going to build my drum for me .
I &apos;m going to call my loved ones next to me , and we &apos;re going to raise loans with dance .
Our whisperers will be our drums .
I &apos;m not going to present to their play .
I &apos;m not going to preserve my name and rhythm to your music .
I &apos;m going to dance , I &apos;m going to resist , I &apos;m going to dance , I &apos;m going to persist and dance .
The heart rate is stronger than death .
Your war drum does no longer sound like my breath . Haaa .
What &apos;s happening with TED people ? Let me hear a little bit about clubs .
( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
Pacifists confused , with aspirations .
I understand you .
I &apos;ve made a lot of mistakes recently .
Just a lot .
So I wasn &apos;t sure what I would read to you today .
I mean , I said I was preparing .
I mean , preparing what I would wear , ( Laughter ) setting up my options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m following and what I &apos;m preceding .
It &apos;s poetry to do that .
Poetry prepares you , it &apos;s up to you .
Now I &apos;m going to read you a poem that I picked right now .
But I need you to sit down for 10 minutes by embracing a woman that &apos;s not there .
Grab it now .
You don &apos;t need you to call it name , just embrace it .
Are you doing that ?
The title is &quot; &quot; Pause from the cluster . &quot; &quot; The whole holy bandwidth story .
The unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
But my mind opens up on what seems limitless , the creative violence of man .
Who will that son be ?
What male will die today ?
The death of our children galvanize us .
There are those dead bodies .
We women bring the bad , complicated .
Prostitutes beat every day .
Infined profit , ignored prophets .
War and infancy with teeth displaced with lemon taste .
A color ring , none of us solid .
Don &apos;t look for the shadow behind me . It &apos;s inside me .
I get light cycles and shadow .
The rhythm is a half-silence .
Now I understand , I &apos;ve never been one and not the other .
Malactia , health , tender violence .
Now I think I &apos;ve never been pure .
Before the form I was storm , blind , ignorant — I &apos;m still .
The human is blind , malignant choice .
Pura never was .
Written before mature .
Language can &apos;t blame me .
I hope exponentially .
Everything is everything .
A woman loses 15 , maybe 20 family members .
One loses six .
A woman loses her head .
One is looking through the rubble , one of the waste .
One shoots in the face . One woman shoots at her husband .
One is hit with cinghia .
A woman gives birth to a child .
One makes frontiers born .
One no longer believes that love can escape it .
A woman never believed us .
Where do the refugee hearts go ?
Trained , unrespected , sent to where they don &apos;t belong , don &apos;t want to be abandoned .
They have to face absence .
We plant each or we don &apos;t mean anything .
My spinal cord folds spiral .
We &apos;re throwing ourselves into a precipice escaping from humans .
Bombs cluster behind us .
Nine old man .
It &apos;s just burned slowly .
Stop contaminated tobacco .
Close bombs .
You take baby teeth .
Collen of palms , smoke .
Stick witnesses , smoke .
Resolution , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Rediting , smoking .
It breaks .
Don &apos;t fear what &apos;s already exploded .
Rather , I exploded it .
Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was studying here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was theoretical .
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
An epidemic of cancer caused by chemicals in the environment would cut down our lives .
Aid rain fell on our forests .
The desert was about two or three kilometers a day .
Oil was about to run out . And a nuclear winter would give us the grace strike .
Nothing happened . ( Laughter ) Incredibly , if you look at what actually happened during my life , average income of the average person on the planet in real terms , updated for inflation has tripled .
The duration of life extended by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Food production per capita has gone up by a third .
And in a time when the population has doubled .
How did we get this — which looks more or less good .
How did we get this ?
How have we managed to become the only species that becomes richer as it becomes more popular ?
The bandwidth here represents the size of the population , and the graph pattern represents GDP per capita .
I think in order to answer this question , you need to first understand how humans can combine their brains so that their ideas combine multiple times to meet and , even , to mate .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we got to make objects so we can make things like this .
They &apos;re both real objects .
One is a hand axe made half a million years ago a typical Homo erectus artifact .
The other is , of course , a computer mouse .
The size and shape are incredibly similar .
I tried to figure out what &apos;s bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
They &apos;re both modeled on the shape of the human hand .
They &apos;re both technologies . But we &apos;re very interested in similarity .
It just tells us that they &apos;re both made for the human hand .
What I &apos;m interested in is differences . The one on the left was equal for about a million years — from a million and a half years ago to half a million years ago .
Homo erectus used the same tool for 30,000 generations .
There were some modifications , of course , but then utensils changed slowly than skeletons .
There was no progress and innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
But the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
There &apos;s another difference , the object on the left is made of one substance .
The one on the right is made of a bunch of different materials , including silicon , metal , plastic and so on .
And most importantly , it &apos;s a product of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of laser , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;re combined together in this technology .
It &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , which intrigues me . I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also an accumulation of ideas , the idea of epidermal cellular , brain , liver .
They got together .
How does evolution accumulate and combine things ?
Let &apos;s say it uses sexual reproduction .
In an asexual species , two mutations in different creatures , a red one and a green one , they have to be better than the other .
One extends and the other survives .
But in a sexualized species , it &apos;s possible that an individual is inherited both of the mutations from different inherited lines .
So sex allows the individual to take on genetic innovations of the entire species .
It &apos;s not limited to an inherited line alone .
What is the process that has the same effect in cultural evolution of what sex has in biological evolution ?
The answer is exchange , habit to exchange one thing for another .
They only do it for humans .
No other animal does that .
We can teach them in the lab to do small exchanges , and in others there &apos;s a reciprocity , but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s ever seen a dog exchange a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There can be culture without exchanges .
You can have an asexuated culture in this way .
Chimpanzees , hormones , these creatures have their culture .
They teach traditions to each other who then turned to the offspring .
Here we see chimpanzees teaching others how to open up nuts with stones .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , they don &apos;t grow up , they don &apos;t accumulate , they don &apos;t combine each other . The reason is that , you know , there &apos;s no sex , there &apos;s no exchange of ideas .
Every set of chimpanzees has a different culture .
There &apos;s no idea exchanges between the different branches .
Why would the exchange increase the quality of life ?
One answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
Here &apos;s a version of the Stone Age , although he put it in terms of economic exchanges .
Adam takes four hours to make a rocket and three to make an axe .
Oz takes an hour to make a launch and two hours for an axe .
So Oz is better than Adam , and he &apos;s making spears and axes .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
It can make lance and axes on its own .
Well , actually , no , because if you think about it , Oz does two lores and Adame does two asks , and then they exchange each one of them has saved an hour of work .
And the more they do it this way , the more it will be true , because the more they do it , and the more Adam improves in making asks and Oz in making lance .
The benefits of trade can only increase .
And one of the great things about exchanges is that one of them creates a drive for a greater specialization , which creates impulse for other exchanges and so on .
Adam and Oz both save an hour of time .
Privacy is time savings in satisfying your needs .
Ask yourself how much you should work to get an hour of light to read a book this evening .
If you start from scratch , go to the countryside for example .
Find a sheep . You kill it . You relate fat .
You work it . You make a candle , etc .
How long does it take ? A lot .
How long do you have to work to buy an hour of light for your readers if you earn an average wage in Britain ?
The answer is : half a second .
In the 1950s , you had to work eight seconds , with an average paycheck to be able to buy the same light .
You &apos;ve earned seven and a half seconds of prosperity , since 1950 , to say that . It &apos;s seven and a half seconds to do something else , or buy other goods or services .
In 1880 , it would take 15 minutes to earn , on average pay , that light .
In 1800 , you had to work six hours to earn a candle for an hour of light .
The average person with an average paycheck in 1800 couldn &apos;t afford a candle .
Let &apos;s go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who made them and who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by a person for themselves .
It &apos;s a case of self-sufficiency .
Today we call it poverty .
But the object on the right was done for me by other people .
How many were these other people ?
Decades ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
Millions , actually .
It needs to be included by the people who grew the coffee that was prepared for the man on the oil platform , and the people who were drilling out and looking for oil from which you make plastic , etc .
They all worked for me , to make a mouse for me .
Companies work like this .
This is what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
In the old days , if you were rich , you had people working for you .
That &apos;s how you got rich ; you gave people work .
Luigi XIV had a lot of people working for him .
They were killing these dumb completes for him , like this . ( Laughter ) And they were preparing his stupid spouse or whatever .
He had 498 people preparing dinner every night .
Even a tourist today who visited Versailles &apos;s building and looks at the paintings of XIV Lights will have 498 other people ready to serve him for dinner .
They &apos;re in bistrot , coffee and restaurants and stores all over Paris , and they &apos;re ready to serve you a excellent dinner with a quality warning orette , probably better than the people who ate XIV Lights .
That &apos;s because everyone works for others .
We celebrate specialization and exchanges , and so we elevate the quality of other people &apos;s lives .
Even animals sometimes work for other animals .
Ants are a classic example : workers work for queens and vice versa .
But the big difference is that this happens only within a colony .
Ants don &apos;t cooperate between one colony and the other .
The reason for this is reproductive division of work .
They specialize in the reproductive field .
The queen does everything .
In our species , we don &apos;t like that much .
The thing that we insist on doing on our own is reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England . We don &apos;t let the queen reproduction .
( Applause ) When did this habit begin ?
How long is that ? And what does that mean ?
I think the oldest version of this is the division of work for sexes .
But I don &apos;t have the evidence .
It seems to me that the first thing we decided was to get the man to work for the woman and the woman for the man .
In hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a division of the work between men hunting and women collecting .
It &apos;s not always that simple . But there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that both sides benefit .
The woman knows this , in the case of the Hadzas that we see here — they extract roots to trade for meat — she knows that in order to have proteins , she just has to extract some root and exchange it for meat .
She doesn &apos;t have to be an exhausting hunt and try to kill a wild wild cinghial .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to dig in order to get roots .
It just has to make sure that when it kills a cinghial it &apos;s big enough to be shared .
The two parts elected the quality of life of the other through the labor score for gender .
When did that happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals did differently .
They were a very collaborative species .
A very clever species .
Their brain was bigger than mine and yours , than anyone in this room today .
They were imaginative . They burst their dead .
They probably spoke a language , we know they had FOX P2 gene , like us . It was discovered here in Oxford .
It turns out they had language skills .
They were brilliant people . I don &apos;t want to talk about the Neanderthals .
But there are no traces of their job division for gender .
There &apos;s no evidence that women worked on crops .
It turns out they were hunting for men .
And then there &apos;s no evidence that there were any trades between the different groups , because the objects that we find between the remains of the Neanderthals , the tools that they built were always made out of local materials .
For example , in Caucasus there &apos;s a excavation where Neanderthal utensils are .
They &apos;re always made of local silicon stone .
In the valley , there are also modern human remains of the same time , 30,000 years ago . Some of them are local silicon stone , but many other tools are made of dioxide that was very far away .
When humans begin to transport objects like this , it &apos;s clear that they exchange products between groups .
Both are 10 times older than agriculture .
People forget and think commerce is a modern thing .
The different groups have been around for 100,000 years .
The first traces are between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa when we see dioxide and diaspora and others moving over long distances in Ethiopia .
We also find shells — and the thing was discovered by researchers in Oxford — who moved 125 miles into the inside from the Mediterranean coast in Algeria .
This shows that people had started exchanges between different groups .
And that led to specialization .
How do you know that long-distance movements indicate exchanges and non-migration ?
We look at modern hunter-gatherers , the aborigens who were taking rocks to make bands in a place called the Isa Monte that was a mine from the Kalkadoon tribe .
They were trading them with their neighbors for other things , like the Pastinia arrows , and the consequence was that stone axes ended a little bit throughout Australia .
The shifting of utensils over long distances is a sign of trade , not migration .
What happens if you stop a people from doing exchanges , and you can specialize ?
The answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress but you get reverse .
One example : Tasmanian .
The sea level stood up 10,000 years ago , Tasmanian became an island , and that people not only did the experience of progressing more slowly than the people on land , but they even found themselves removing .
They lost the ability to produce bone utensils and fishing materials and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people simply wasn &apos;t enough to keep these specialized techniques necessary to keep alive technologies that they already had .
If people in this room were put on a desert island .
How many objects in your pocket would we still be able to produce in 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen in the Earth of Fuoco — a similar island , a similar people .
The reason ? The Fire Earth is separated from South America from a much thinner narrow , and there were always contacts of exchange through the narrow for 10,000 years .
The Tasmanian people were isolated .
Let &apos;s go back to this image and ask yourself not only who did it and who , but also , who knew how to build it ?
The stone axe . The man who built it knew how to do it .
But who knows how you build a computer mouse ?
No one , really .
Nobody on this planet can make a computer mouse .
I really say .
The president of the company who does the mouse doesn &apos;t know how to do one .
It just knows how to make the company work .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t sail it , because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill a pool of oil to find oil and make plastic , etc .
Each of us knows a little bit about things , but nobody knows everything .
I &apos;m quoting a famous essay by Leonard Reed , an economist in the 1950s called &quot; &quot; I , Matita , &quot; &quot; in which he talked about how a pencil is produced , and how no one knows how to make a pencil , because the assembly cannot extract the graphite cannot cut the trees and so on .
What we &apos;ve done in the human society through trade and specialization has been creating the ability to produce things that we don &apos;t even understand .
With the spoken language , that &apos;s not the case .
With language , we have to transfer ideas that we all understand .
But with technology , we can build things far beyond our ability .
We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary level .
By the way , that &apos;s why I don &apos;t care about the Quix of Intelligence debate about which group has more than others .
I find it completely irrelevant .
The relief thing about society is how people can communicate their ideals , and how smart they can cooperate , not how smart they are as individuals .
We created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just nodes in this network .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the exchange of ideas the meeting and matching ideas among them that are causing technological progress incrementally , a piece at a time .
And bad things can also happen .
And in the future , as we move forward , we will certainly have terrible experiences .
There will be wars and depressions ; there will be natural calamities .
Things are going to happen in this century , I &apos;m sure .
But it &apos;s also this , because of the contacts that people create with each other because of the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will make great progress , and so also the quality of life .
Because of this nube , external collaborations , of this underlying world that we &apos;ve created , where not only the elites , but everyone can have their own ideas and meet and mate and accelerate the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

Good afternoon .
My name is Uldus .
I &apos;m a Russian photographic artist .
I started my career six years ago with ironical portraits at the end of revealing the many stereotypes on nationality , gender , and on social issues , &#91; I &apos;m Russian . I &apos;m selling drugs , weapons , porn with children ! &#93; &#91; Vodka = water . I love vodka ! &#93; ( Laughter ) using photography to send a message . &#91; Sposami , I need a visa visa &#93; Still I &apos;m looking at Wonder .
I &apos;m focusing on directing a meaningful , aesthetic message , beauty , composition , a little irony , and artifacts .
I &apos;m going to talk today about my project , which is called Desperate Romantics .
These are my artifacts , or paintings of the Hungarian England , the mid-19th century .
I took the paintings and enriched them from a new , contemporary meaning , talking about issues surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are not models but have an interesting story .
This guy is a professional dancer , he &apos;s only 12 years old , but in school , he &apos;s hiding his passion and wearing the mask of brutality , trying to stay united with the rest of his classmates just like a tall soldier who has no personality .
But this kid has goals and dreams that hide to be accepted by society , because being different is not easy , especially in Russia .
The next interpretation of the painting is metaphorical .
This is Nikita , a legal guard of a pub in St. Peteroburg .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting a Hulk joke , but I never saw him angry .
It ignores its sensitivity and its romantic side , because in Russia , among kids , it &apos;s not good to be romantic , whereas it &apos;s surrounded by women and it looks like an aggressive Hulk .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I take the painting and confirm it a new meaning and a new insider .
Sometimes , they compare features of the face and play with words : irony , Iron Man , man stirring .
( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I carry social issues , surrounding me in conversations in Russia .
One interesting thing about marriage in Russia is that most 18-19 girls , are already ready , dream of getting married .
They teach us from childhood that successful marriage is equal to a successful life , so many girls struggle to have a good husband .
What about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
For the Russian society , I &apos;m an old joke that has no hope to marry .
That &apos;s why you see me with a Mexican fighting mask , in a wedding dress , desperately in my garden .
But remember , the key is irony , and it &apos;s made to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and to change stereotypes .
Be brave . Be ironical , help .
Be creative and create magic .

My name is Amit .
18 months ago , I had another job at Google , but I launched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s here in the room , and she gave me permission to do it .
It took 18 months .
Many negotiations and fun stories , I assure you , with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries .
But I want to focus on demo .
There are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve created this .
I think my personal story is explained in a simple way in the slide , and it &apos;s access .
I grew up in India .
I got a wonderful education — I didn &apos;t like it — but I didn &apos;t have access to many of these museums and these works of art .
So when I started traveling and visiting these museums , I began to learn a lot .
And during my work at Google , I tried to bring technology together this desire to make them more accessible .
So we formed a team , a team of big people , and we started doing that .
It &apos;s better to start the presentation and then tell you a couple of interesting events that happened after the launch .
So , simple : go to googleartproject.com.
Take a look at all the museums there are .
Find the Uffizi , find the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
I &apos;m now entering one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
There are two ways to enter — very simple .
Click and , boom , you &apos;re in the museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
Go around and have fun .
Do you want to move to the museum salt ?
Open the map , and , in a click , jump .
You &apos;re here , you want to go to the other end of the hallway .
Keep going . Keep it .
Explorate .
( Applause ) Thank you . But I haven &apos;t come to the best part yet .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;m standing in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Mietters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
I see this sign more .
If the museum gave us the image , you can click on it .
Here &apos;s one of the images .
Here &apos;s all the supplementary information .
Those who are really passionate about art can click here , but for the moment I make it disappear .
This is one of the images we made with a technology called gigapixel .
This image , for example , I think is comprised of about 10 billion pixels .
And a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you do about 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
I want to try to show you what you can do with 10 billion pixels .
You can zoom in very easily .
As you can see , funny things happen .
I love this guy ; his expression is unpaid .
But I really want to go deep .
I started playing a little bit , and I found something on this side .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Wait . It sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I zoom in , and I realized that actually these kids are just sticking something .
I did some research , talked to a couple of people at the Met , and eventually I found that this is a game called &quot; &quot; Squail , &quot; &quot; which was practicing by sticking a little on the day of Tuesday Grace .
It seems to be very popular .
I have no idea why it was , but I learned something about it .
Now we really zoom in at the bottom , we can actually get to the cracks .
Now , to give you a little perspective , I &apos;m going to go away and really show you what it is .
This is where we were before , and this is the picture .
( Applause ) But the best still has to come , give me a second .
Now let &apos;s go quickly to MoMA , back to New York .
Another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; Stelled Night . &quot; &quot; The example I just showed you was all focused on detail .
But what if you wanted to see the paintbrushes ?
What if someone wanted to see how Van Gogh really created his masterpiece ?
Zoomate . Go really deep .
Now I get to one of my favorite points in the painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks in the paint .
This is Stelled Night , I think , as you &apos;ve never seen .
I want to show you my other favorite function .
There are many other functions , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the really cool part . It &apos;s called Collectures .
Any one of you , anybody , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , if you have a bad home — it doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own online museum , create your collection with all these images .
Very simply , you enter — I created this called the Zoom Power — and you can look around .
This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; at the National Gallery .
You can write notes , send them to your friends and start talking about what you think when you walk around these masterpieces .
I think , to conclude , the most important thing for me is that all these wonderful things don &apos;t all come from Google .
They don &apos;t come from , in my opinion , even from museums .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t say that .
They come from artists .
This was my illuminating experience .
I mean , I hope that with this digital medium , we can actually make justice to their artwork and represent them online as they deserve .
The most important question I &apos;m asked about these days is , &quot; &quot; Did you do all this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to expand that experience .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a storyteller .
This is what I do , I tell stories about historians , writing fiction . Today I want to tell you a little bit about the art of storytelling and also about some supernatural creatures called djinni .
But before I get there , let me share some of my personal stories .
I &apos;m going to do it with the help of words , of course , but also with a geometric form : the circle . So during this talk , you &apos;re going to go through some circles .
I was born in Strasburgh in France by Turkish parents .
Shortly after , my parents separated , and I moved to Turkey with my mom .
Since then , I was raised as a single mother &apos;s only daughter .
In the early 1970s , in Ankara , this was a little unusual .
In our neighborhood there were lots of countless families , where fathers were family leaders , so I grew up seeing my mother divorced in a patriarchal environment .
In fact , I grew up looking at two ways of being a woman .
On the one hand was my mother , a educated , secular , modern , Western woman .
On the other hand , there was my grandmother , who was also about me , and she was more spiritual , less educated and far less rational .
She was a woman who read coffee funds to predict the future and founded the lead into mysterious forms to keep the malarious look away .
A lot of people would visit my grandmother , people with heavy faces or ruins on their hands .
Every time , my grandmother would whisper a few words in Arabic , take a red apple and swallow it with a lot of rose spines as the verbs he wanted to remove .
Then one by one , he would circled the spines with dark ink .
After a week , the patient would come back for a controlled exam .
I &apos;m aware that I shouldn &apos;t talk about this kind of thing in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is that among all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin diseases , I never saw anyone go back to grief or unrecovered .
I asked her how she did it . Was it the power of the prayer ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Yes , the prayer is effective . But you &apos;re also aware of the power of the circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned from other things , a really precious lesson , that if you want to destroy something in this life , whether it &apos;s acne , imperfection or human soul , the only thing to do is to surround him with thick walls .
It &apos;s going to dry from the inside .
We all live in a kind of social and cultural circle .
We all do that .
We are born in a crooked family , nation , class .
But if we don &apos;t have any kind of connection with the worlds beyond the world that we take for granted , then we also run the risk of secreting from the inside .
Our imagination could shrink . Our hearts could be smaller , and our humanity applies if we &apos;re too long in our cultural cocoons .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family , if all the people in our inner circle look like us , it means we &apos;re surrounded by our specular image .
Another thing that women like my grandmother do in Turkey is to cover the mirrors with sailors or to hang them on the wall with the side of the eye .
It &apos;s an ancient eastern tradition based on consciousness that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at its image .
Ironically , living in communities of people who think of it as us is one of the greatest dangers in the global world today .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere , between liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , both in the West and the East .
We tend to form groups based on similarities , and we create stereotypes on other groups of people .
For me , one way to transcend these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
Stories can &apos;t break down borders , but they can make holes in our mental walls .
And through these holes , we can get into each other , and sometimes what we see we also like .
I started writing fiction at eight years old .
My mother came home one day with a Turkish cousin and asked me if I would be interested in keeping a personal journal .
When I look back at it , I think it was slightly concerned about my mental health .
I used to tell stories at home , which was fine , except I told my imaginary friends , which didn &apos;t work well .
I was an introverted little girl at the point that I was talking to colored pencils and apologizing to the objects I screamed for wrong , so my mother thought it would make me feel good to write about my everyday experiences and emotions .
What he didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was write about me .
Instead , I started writing about people who were not me and things that had never happened .
So he started a life &apos;s passion in writing novels .
So in principle , the narrative for me was not as much a autobiographical manifestation as a transcendent journey to other lives , other possibilities .
And have some patience for me . I &apos;m going to draw a circle and go back to this point .
Another thing happened at this time .
My mother became a diplomat .
So from this little , superstitious neighborhood in my grandmother , I was projected in this luxurious international school in Madrid , where I was the only Turk .
That &apos;s where I had my first meeting with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreign . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children of all nationality , but this diversity didn &apos;t necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , all-democracy in the classroom .
Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which every child was seen , not as an individual by itself , but as a representative of something larger .
We were like the United Nations in miniature , which was fun , except when something negative about a country or religion was happening .
The child who represented was buried , ridiculed infinitely by the bullets .
And I know that well , because in the time I spent in that school , there was a military coup in my country , an armed man of my own nationality almost killed the Dad and Turkey got zero as a score on the Eurofestival contest .
( Laughter ) I would often save school and dream of becoming a puppeteer during those days .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes .
The other kids asked me about the film &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I hadn &apos;t seen . They asked me how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were great smokers , and they asked me what age I was going to start to cover my boss .
I learned that these were the three main stereotypes of my country , politics , cigarettes and veil .
After Spain , we went to Jordan in Germany and back to Ankara .
Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could carry with me .
The tales gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big C that I otherwise wasn &apos;t without .
By the age of 20 , I moved to Instanbul , the city I love .
I lived in a very vivid , vary neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake was in &apos; 99 .
When I walked out of the building at three o &apos;clock in the morning , I saw something that made me stop the pace .
There was the local grocery store , an elderly scholar that didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t talk to the marginalized .
He was sitting next to a wasp wearing a long black parrot , and the male was hitting them on his cheeks .
I saw the man opening a pile of cigarettes with his hands shaking and offering him one . And this is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today , a conservative grocery and a travesty crying together on the sidewalk .
In the drama of destruction and death , our mondane differences evaporated , and we became one with only a few hours .
But I always believed that stories have a similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not saying that storytelling has the same magnitude as a earthquake , but when we &apos;re reading a beautiful novel , we &apos;re leaving our little apartments behind , and we &apos;re leaving alone in the night and we &apos;re starting to learn about people we &apos;d never met before and maybe we even had biases about .
Shortly after that , I went to a female university in Boston in Michigan .
I &apos;ve lived it not as much as a change in place but as a kind of language .
I started writing novels in English .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile , and they ask me why to do this , but the commuter between languages gives me a chance to recreate myself .
I love to write in Turkish , which is very poetic and emotional to me , and I love to write in English , which is very mathematical and celebral to me .
I feel connected to both languages in different ways .
For me , like for millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
When you learn a language late , what happens is that you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
As we get there , we always want to say more , have better battles , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a space between the mind and the language .
And that space is frightening .
But if we can &apos;t be afraid , it &apos;s also stimulating .
And this is what I found in Boston , that frustration was very exciting .
At this point , my grandmother , who had been watching me during the process of my life with increasing anxiety , began to include in her daily prayers the fact that I married myself in the earliest way that I could fix once for all .
And because God likes it , I really married .
( Laughter ) But instead of fixing myself , I went to Arizona .
And because my husband is in Istanbul , I started moving between Arizona and Istanbul . Two places on Earth that could not be different .
I think a part of me will always be nomadic , physically and spiritually .
Stories accompanied me , holding the fragments of my memories together , like an esitential glue .
But as long as I like stories , I recently started to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen for more than it is .
And this is the subject that I would love to think about with you .
When my first novel in English came out in America , it felt an interesting note from a literary critic .
&quot; I like your book , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; But I wish I had written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what that meant .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well look at it . There are so many Spanish people , Americans and Hispanic characters , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and he &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; The novel is set on a university campus in Boston , so it was common for me that there were more international characters who Turn , but I understood what the critic meant .
And I also realized that I would continue to disappoint it .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
He wanted a Turkey woman in the book because that was what I was .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of political identity affects the way that stories circulate , they &apos;re lectures and reviews .
Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more strongly .
For a writer woman from a Muslim world , like me , the expectation is that I write stories of Muslim women , possibly , unhappy stories of Muslim women .
The expectation is that he writes stories that are informative and pervasive and that leaves experimentation and cutting-edge to Western colleagues .
What I lived in that school in Madrid as a child is happening in the literary world today .
The writers are not seen as creatives themselves , but as representatives of their own cultures , some authors from China , some from Turkey , some from Nigeria .
They teach us to have something really distinctive , if not particular .
The writer and commuter , James Baldwin , released an interview from 1984 where he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
When the interviewer tried to stack him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that there &apos;s nothing in all the others , and nothing in others that isn &apos;t in me . &quot; &quot; When political identity tries to tag us , it &apos;s our freedom to the imagination that is in danger .
There &apos;s a slightly ambiguous category , called multicultural literature where all the authors who don &apos;t belong to the Western world are gathered together .
I will never forget my first multicultural public reading , at Harvard square 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one from the Philippines , a Turk and an Indonesian , like a joke .
( Laughter ) And the reason we were put together was not because we had the same kind of literary taste .
It was for our passports .
You expect multicultural writers to tell real stories , not so much the imagery .
A function is attributed to narrative .
In this way , not just the authors themselves , but also their characters become the representatives of something larger .
But I have to quickly say that this trend in seeing in a story more than a story is not just coming from the cruise .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And this was the first person I experienced when I was processed in 2005 for the words that a character of mine said in a novel .
I wanted to write a constructive and multi-faceted romance on a family that was armenous and a Turk through a woman &apos;s gaze .
My little story became a huge problem when there was the process .
Some people criticized me , some people loyed me for writing about the turco-archal conflict .
But there were times when I wanted to remember the parts that were a novel .
It was just a story .
And when I say &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to undermine my work .
I want to love and celebrate literature for what it is , not as a means for a end .
The writers have the right to have their political opinions , and there are great political novels , but the language of storytelling is not the language of everyday politics .
Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the best way to ask the question is two completely different things .
And only that last is the responsibility of the writer . &quot; &quot; Political identity divides us . The narrative unites .
One is interested in getting rid of generalizations .
The other one in the nuances .
It &apos;s a boundaries .
The other one recognizes frontiers .
Political identity is made up of solid bricks .
The narrative is water flowing .
During the Ottoman empire , there were talented stories called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They went to coffee rooms , where they told stories in public , often improvising .
For every protagonist in history , the meddah changed the timber of voice , giving him a personality .
Everybody could go and listen , ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and not .
Stories cross borders . Like Nasreddin Hodja &apos;s tales , which were very popular across the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
Today stories continue to transcend borders .
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they don &apos;t usually listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader read the same as a novel by a Jewish writer , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the storyteller .
Literature has to take us beyond that .
If it can &apos;t get us there , it &apos;s not good literature .
The books saved the introvert , shy little girl I was , once .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger that there is to make it a beetle .
When the poet and mystical , Rumi , met his spiritual partner , Shams from Tabriz , one of the first things Shams did was he threw the books of Rumi into the water and he was looking at the dissolved words .
The Sufi say , &quot; &quot; The knowledge that brings you not beyond yourself is much worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with cultural ghettos today is not the lack of knowledge . We know a lot about us , or we believe it , but the knowledge that brings us not beyond ourselves , makes us elitist , distant and unconnected .
There &apos;s a metaphor that I love : living as a design compound .
As you know , a leg of the compass is static , fixed in a place .
And the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
What I write is like a compass .
One part is fixed in Istanbul with strong turbulent roots , but the other side travels around the world , connecting to different cultures .
In that sense , I like to think that my writing is local and universal at the same time , from here and from all sides .
Those of you who have been to Istanbul probably saw the Topkapi building , which was the residence of the Ottoman sultans for over 400 years .
In the building , right outside of the favorite pool district , there &apos;s a place called Djinn &apos;s meeting place .
It &apos;s in between buildings .
This concept intrigues me .
We don &apos;t usually trust these zones , which are between things .
We perceive them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , which are made of fire without smoke and are the symbol of elusivity .
But my point is maybe that the elusive space is what the writers need most .
When I write narratives about helusivity and mutability , I care about it .
I don &apos;t like to know what &apos;s going to happen 10 pages later .
I love when my characters surprise me .
I could write about a Muslim woman in a novel , and maybe it &apos;s going to be a really joyful story , and in my next book , I could write about a beautiful gay professor in Norway .
Until our hearts come from , we can write everything and everything .
Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The West fathers taught us to say , &quot; &quot; I think so I am . &quot; &quot; She proposed , &quot; &quot; I have feelings so I &apos;m free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a fantastic paradigm shift .
But despite what ever in creative writing courses today , the first thing we teach students is to write what you know ?
Maybe that &apos;s not the right way to start .
Imagination literature is not necessary to write about what we are and what we know or what our identity is .
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write about our feelings .
We should get out of our cultural ghetto and visit the next door and the next one .
Finally , stories move like the rotating deviss , drawing circle after circle .
By connecting all of humanity , not curating of political identity , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I &apos;d like to end with an old sufi poem . &quot; &quot; Come on , we &apos;re friends for once ; we make life easy for us ; we become lovers and love ; land will not resist anyone . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
My name is Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a video game writer .
We get more results in online worlds .
That &apos;s why , so far , collectively all World of Warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years solving Azeroth &apos;s virtual problems .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
We &apos;re evolving to collaborate more and to have more heart .
As a result , we really have more robust social relationships .
Five million people use it every month .
This is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
His studies are brilliant . He &apos;s studying why he &apos;s working .
But it &apos;s not , in any way , an ideal situation .
We need to start making the world more like a game .
Before we had joysticks and wonderful buttons , we had sheep bones .
People were suffering , people were facing .
This is very interesting .
according to Erodoto , after 18 years , the king decided that they would play a final game in dice .
We want to imagine epic victories and then give people the tools to make them .
We made this game in 2007 .
This is an incredible story ! An affair you can participate in !
There &apos;s a comic book story , it &apos;s increasing by skills like local knowledge , collaboration , sustainability , imagination and inventory .
The Dirty Jobs crew , and I was invited to a small Colorado country called Craig .
It &apos;s only 62 square kilometers of superification and it &apos;s on the Rottish Mountains .
And the work in question was the sheep farmer .
My role in the show , for those who haven &apos;t seen it , is quite simple .
I &apos;m an apprentice and work with people who actually do the summer in question .
And my duties are simply trying to learn and give an honest assessment of what these people are like for a day in their lives .
The work in question : grazing sheep . Great !
We go to Creig and we record ourselves in a hotel , and I realize the next day that the castration will be the absolute part of this work .
So normally , I don &apos;t do any research at all .
But this is a delicate subject , and I work for Discovery Channel , and we want to represent precisely everything we do , and we want to do it with a lot of respect for animals .
So I called Hhuman Society , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , can you explain what to do ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah , it &apos;s pretty trivial . &quot; &quot; They use a little bit of an elastic , basically , like this one , just a little bit smaller .
This is actually around the game cards that I got yesterday , but it had an undoubtedly similar similarity to that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the procedure ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The slice is applied to the tail in a narrow way .
And then another slice is applied to the cockroach , narrow .
The blood flow is slowly delayed , and a week later the parts are disappearing .
&quot; Great ! Get it all ! &quot;
All right , I call SPCA for confirmation , they confirm .
I also call PETA for fun . They don &apos;t like it , but they confirm .
Okay , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
So the next day I &apos;m going to go .
And I get given a horse and we go and take the needles and we bring them into a fence that we built and start this farm thing .
Melanie is Albert &apos;s wife .
Albert is the shepherd of history .
Melanie raises the needle — two hands — one hand with both right legs , the same way on the left .
The lamb goes to the site , and she makes it dive .
All right , big .
Albert comes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
I always watch the procedure done the first time before I tried it .
You know , being an apprentice , you do that .
Albert line his hand in his pocket to pull out , you can imagine , this elastic black slice , but what comes out is a cycling knife .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Mmm — that &apos;s not elastic at all ! &quot; &quot; You can imagine it .
And he pulls out the blade in a way that captured the sun that was right at that moment reaching the Ross Mountains . It was very — it was impressive .
Within about two seconds , Albert had the knife in the middle of the tail cartilage , right next to the back of the needle , and very quickly the tail had gone and inside the bucket that I was holding with my hands .
And a second later , with a big thumb and a nice Hinder callosum , he had a stewardly shot in his grasp .
And he pulled it up like this , took the blade and put it on the end .
Now you think you know what &apos;s going to happen , Michael . No , you don &apos;t know ! OK .
It cuts it , it grabs its extremity beyond its shoulders , and then it grabs the scrotus and it pushes it up and then its head drops into the darkness of my sight , but what I hear is the sound of a suck and a noise that sounds like a Velcro stripped away from a sticky wall , and I &apos;m not even kidding .
Can we send the video ?
No , I &apos;m joking , we don &apos;t . ( Laughter ) I thought it was better to discuss it with images .
So , I do something that I never did and never did during Dirty Jobs &apos;s footage . Never .
I say , &quot; &quot; Pause . Stop . &quot; &quot; You all know the show , we just do one ciak , we don &apos;t do a second shot .
There &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no absurdity .
We don &apos;t play , we don &apos;t make evidence , we turn what happens to us !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is crazy . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know what I &apos;m saying .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s crazy .
We can &apos;t do that . And Albert says , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there &apos;s testes in this bucket and this is not how we do things . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him clarify , &quot; I want to do it in the right way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And he said goodness .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t shake and bleed the agel . We &apos;re on five continents &apos; television , good !
We wave twice a day on Discovery Channel , we can &apos;t do this ! &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; All right . &quot; &quot; He goes to his cassette and he pulls out a bag of these little elastic slices .
Melanie raises another lamb , puts it on the post , a slice goes around the tail , a slice goes around the wrist .
The lamb comes back to the ground , the lamb takes two steps , falls up , gets up , goes up a little bit , takes another couple of steps , falls down .
I &apos;m like , &quot; This is not a good symptom for the needle at all . &quot;
It gets up , it goes to the corner , it &apos;s shaking and it &apos;s shaking and it &apos;s obvious suffering .
And I look at the needle and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; One day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; One day ! How long does it take to stay apart ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One week . &quot;
Meanwhile , the agel that just had the little intervention is , you can imagine , he &apos;s shining . The emorragy was over .
He &apos;s , you can imagine , continuing to crawl a little bit of grass , jumping .
And I was so shocked by how completely wrong I was in that moment .
I was reminded of how completely wrong I am for most of the time .
( Laughter ) And I was particularly reminded of what unpleasant task that struck me that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these arranges in the fence , and suddenly this story is beginning to appear like a German porn , and I &apos;m like , Melanie solves the acid , puts it on the post , release the legs .
Albert passes my knife .
Inside , the tail comes out .
By the way , I grab the cockroach , the extremity comes away .
Albert gives instructions : &quot; &quot; Keep it up . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; Make it more . &quot;
I do .
The testes emerge , they look like thumbs , prosthetics to you , and he says , &quot; &quot; Death them .
Just crawl away with a bite . &quot; &quot; And I heard that , I heard all the words .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m like , how did I get here ?
&quot; How ? &quot; &quot; you know , I mean , &quot; How did I get here ? &quot;
( Laughter ) It &apos;s right , it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes on its own , and all of a sudden , I &apos;m there on Rockose Mountains , and all I can think about is the aristotelical definition of tragedy .
You know , Aristotle says that tragedy is the moment when hero comes to face with his real identity .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this metaphor out there ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight so I did what I had to do .
I proceeded and I stopped them .
I grabbed them like this , and I grabbed my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testes on my chment .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t catch it , I can &apos;t check the metaphor for myself .
Okay , I &apos;m still in poetic , Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking , from nothing — two terms come to shrink in my head that I hadn &apos;t heard since my Greek and Latin professor at college fires them .
And these are : anagnorisis and peripeteia .
Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
What our TV network does is what Dirty Jobs is .
And I find myself till the neck in anagnorisis every single day .
Great .
The other word : peripheral . This is the moment in the great tragedies , you know , Euripid and Sofocle , the moment Edipo has his moment , where he understands that the beautiful pump that he &apos;s been to bed with and he &apos;s done his kids is his mother . OK .
This is periphery or peripheral .
And this metaphor in my head , I have anagnorisis and the peripeteia on my process .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , it &apos;s a great stratagem anyway .
When you start looking for peripheral , you find it everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in the Senate Sesto , right ?
He runs the whole film trying to help the little kid see dead people , and then , boom , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; Perieteia .
Remember ?
It &apos;s intense when the audience sees it in the right way .
Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; remember ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program . &quot; &quot; Owesome .
These discoveries that lead to improvisational purposes , and I &apos;ve had them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that , has lifted my mind in a way that I wasn &apos;t prepared for .
And while I was standing there , looking at the happy agel that — you know , I had just taken advantage of it , but it seemed okay .
Looking at that other poor creature that I had treated in the right way , and I was really struck by thinking , &quot; If I &apos;m in the wrong torture about this , if I &apos;m in the torso so often , literally , what other misconceptions could I be able to comment ? &quot;
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who is .
And I talk to him !
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey , Mike .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your mind is interested in this kind of thing , but have you realized that you &apos;ve made documentaries in any situation ?
You worked in the mine , you worked in fishing , you worked in steel , you worked in every major industry .
You &apos;ve been pushed to the shoulder with these people that our politicians can &apos;t wait to relate every four years . Right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the little whiskey shirts on his segment , gluing on his face , with the metalactics .
I mean , this is the people I work with every single day .
And if you had something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
Because , buddy , you know , four years . So , this is in my head , the testes are on my chment , the thoughts bounce around .
And after that shot , Dirty Jobs didn &apos;t actually change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed to me personally .
And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer tell the story that you heard and 190 like this .
I do that , but I also start talking about some of the other things that I misunderstood , some of the other notions about the work that I thought so far was sacrosive , and I &apos;m not .
People who do dirty jobs are happier than you think .
As a group , they are the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start staring at the delight of the advertising &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label &quot; &quot; and all those tight ones on the happy worker .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people doing unthinkable jobs .
The gatherers of the carcasses of animals killed on the street whistling as they work , I swear to God . I did it with them .
They have this amazing sort of symmetry of their life .
And I see it repeatedly .
So I started wondering what would happen if we challenged some of these dogmas .
&quot; &quot; Take your passion . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve talked about it here for the last 36 hours .
&quot; &quot; follow your passion , &quot; &quot; what could be wrong with that ?
Probably the worst advice I &apos;ve ever had .
( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and fail , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told , &quot; If you follow your passion , it &apos;s certainly going to be OK . &quot;
I can give you 30 examples now . Bob Combs , a pig farmer from Las Vegas collecting the advances of uneaten food from casinos and feeding them to his pigs .
Why ? Because there are so many proteins in the stuff that we don &apos;t eat that his pigs grow twice the normal speed , and he &apos;s a rich pig farmer and he &apos;s good for the environment and he &apos;s spending his days doing this incredible service , and he &apos;s barely puffing , but God bless it .
It &apos;s making a great life .
You ask him , &quot; &quot; Have you followed your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he would laugh at you .
This is a person worth it , he was offered 60 million dollars for his farm and rejected them , outside Las Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He took a step back and looked at where everyone was going and he went to the other side .
And I hear that story repeatedly .
Matt Froind , a milk producer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized that the dung of his cows was worth more than their milk , if he used it to make these biodegradable vessels for flowers .
He &apos;s selling them now in Walmart .
He follows his passion , this guy , but go !
So I started looking at passion , and I started to think about efficiency against efficacy , as Tim mentioned earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
I started to look at the work of teams and determination , and basically all those trivial qualities that they call followers , which are hanging on the walls with that apple art in the boardroom halls around the world right now .
That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly thrilled in its head .
Security — safety in the first place .
It &apos;s me coming back , you know , at OSHA and PETA and HumanSociety . What if OSHA was wrong ?
I mean , this is heresy , what I &apos;m going to say , but what if security was actually the third place ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I really say .
What I mean by that is that I value my security in these crazy jobs as much as the people I &apos;m working with , but those who really lead to the job , are not there to discuss security in the first place .
They know that other things come first — the whole thing about doing work comes first , the whole thing about bringing it to a good end .
And I &apos;ll never forget , on the Bering Sea , I was on a fishing boat with the world &apos;s largest fishermen , and I worked with even in the first season of the program .
We &apos;re about 160 miles off the coast of Russia , a sea that &apos;s 15 meters deep , remarkable waves , green water that reaches the timber room , right ?
The most risky conditions I &apos;ve ever seen , and I was behind a guy , reading between them the trap cands for fish .
I &apos;m suspended at 12 meters from the bridge , which is like looking down at the tip of your feet , you can imagine it , and the boat is doing this in the ocean .
Remarkably dangerous .
I blow down , I go into the control cabin , and I say , with a little bit of disbelief , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said later can &apos;t be repeated in the continental United States below Alaska .
It can &apos;t be repeated in any planning of an industrial facility or any construction site .
But he looked at me and he said , &quot; &quot; Kind ... &quot; &quot; he &apos;s my same age , by the way , he calls me a piece , and I like that — he says , &quot; &quot; Kind , I &apos;m the captain of a fishing mask .
My responsibility is not to bring you alive at home .
My responsibility is to take you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; Do you want to go home ? That &apos;s up to you . &quot;
And for the rest of the day , security in the first place !
I mean , I was kind of — So , the idea that we create this fake , this sense of complacency , when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as if it was ours , and vice versa .
Anyway , a lot of things .
I could talk for a long time about many small distinctions that we &apos;ve done and the list without ending of ways that I &apos;ve misunderstood .
But what you &apos;re reducing is this .
I formulated a theory , and I want to share it now in the two minutes and 30 seconds that I have left .
It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , really .
We didn &apos;t try to do it , and we didn &apos;t enrich mustache in a masterpiece way , but we did .
We conducted this war at least on four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we represent people working on television , it &apos;s ridiculous .
If there &apos;s a hydroculist , it weighs 130 pounds and it has a giant burden of the seat , let &apos;s admit it .
You see it all the time .
That &apos;s what hydroculic looks like , right ?
We make them heroes or make them become zimbels .
This is what television does .
We in Dirty Jobs try hard not to do that , and that &apos;s why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
But we conducted this war in Madison Avenue .
I mean , so many advertising campaigns coming out of there — in a way of a message , what is it actually said ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little bit less , if you didn &apos;t have to work that hard , if you could renew a little bit earlier , if you could retire a little bit faster , if you could punch the folder a little bit earlier , it &apos;s all there , again , repeatedly .
Washington ! I don &apos;t know where to start discussing agreements and organized policies that affect the reality of the first line of jobs available because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that this is a front of this war .
And right here , guys : Silicon Valley . I mean , how many people have an iPhone on it right now ?
How many people have their Blackberry ?
We &apos;re attached to a shot , we &apos;re connected .
I would never suggest for a second that something bad came out of the technological revolution .
God sadly , not this crowd .
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
And nobody celebrates the imitation in the way that Dirty Jobs &apos;s guys know that it has to be done .
Your iPhone without those people who make the same interface , the same electric system , the same printed circuit , repeatedly .
All that — that &apos;s what makes it as much as possible as the geniality that goes inside .
So , we have this new toolbox , you know .
These tools today don &apos;t look like pale and spikes .
They look like the stuff that we &apos;re walking around with .
And so the collective effect of this was this marginalization of cows and cows of work .
And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do another 200 of these things , but we want to do more than we can .
And for me , the most important thing to know and to really compare with , is the fact that I &apos;ve misunderstood a lot of things , not just the testes on my face .
I &apos;ve misunderstood a lot .
So , we &apos;re thinking , thanks to us , I want to say thank you to me that the thing to do is to discuss a campaign of promotion in favor of work , manual labor , worker labor .
You need somebody out there who discards forgotten benefits .
I &apos;m talking about the vision of grandparents . Of that stuff that a lot of us probably grew up with , but we have a little bit , you know , a little lost .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a huge deal .
This war at work , which I believe exists , produces victims like any other war .
The infrastructure is the first . Except decline in professional schools are the second one .
Every year , less electricists , less carpenters , less hydroculars , less saldators , less tubes , less carpenters for steam pipes .
The infrastructure work that everybody talks about creating is those people , the ones that have been decimated , repeatedly .
Meanwhile , we have two trillion dollars , as a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Ingeigers , which we need to spend at least to leave a sign in the infrastructure that is currently classified by D — at least .
So if I was running for a charge , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the work that we hope to accomplish and the summer that we hope to create will not last unless it &apos;s jobs that people want .
And I know the topic of this conference is celebrating the things that are close and care to us , but I also know that clean and dirty are not opposed .
These are two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripeteia and anagnorisis , like the poor little agel , which I hope is not shaking anymore and as time at my disposal which is over .
It was great to talk to you and go back to work , okay ?
( Applause )
My great idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of great ideas that are , at the moment , latent inside us .
And the little idea that will allow us to do that is to sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a po-A women &apos;s room . This is a room .
Women with sleep deficit .
And I learned about my skin , the value of sleep .
Two and a half years ago , I came out of fatigue .
I broke my head on my desk , fractured my zigom , put five points to my right eye .
And I began the journey to cover the value of sleep .
And during that journey , I studied . I met doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the path to a more productive , more inspired and more joyful life is : sleep long enough .
( Applause ) And we &apos;re going to be women who are the first step in this new revolution , the new feminist issue .
We &apos;re going to get to the top , literally sleeping more .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , for men , the lack of sleep has become a symbol of virility .
Since recently , I was at dinner with a man who was expected to sleep only four hours a night before .
And he came to tell him — but I didn &apos;t tell him — he came to me and said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If I had slept five hours , this dinner would have been much more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s currently a kind of competition that &apos;s based on lack of sleep .
In particular here in Washington , if you try to meet someone for breakfast and propose , &quot; &quot; Is it okay to eight ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll probably answer you , &quot; &quot; 8 a.m. ? It &apos;s a little late for me , but okay , I can do a tennis game and a couple of calls and then meet you . &quot; &quot; And they think that means they &apos;re extraordinarily engaged and productive , but the truth is that they &apos;re not making a business decision at the moment .
So , a high IQ .
It doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is to be able to see the iceberg before the Titanic hits .
And we had too many iceberg that hit our Titanic .
In fact , I have a feeling , that if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Brothers and Sisters , it could still be active .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy being hyperconnected 24 hours on 24 , seven days on 7 , maybe a sister , would have noticed the iceberg , because she would wake up after seven and a half hours or eight hours of sleep and she would be able to have a vision together .
So , just as we &apos;re confronting with all the multiple crises in our world right now , what &apos;s going to do right at the personal level , what &apos;s going to bring us more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and that it &apos;s going to be the best for our careers , it &apos;s also the best thing for the world .
So I urge you to close your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , turn off your motors and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So as Chris said , I study the human brain function and structure of the human brain .
And I want you to think for a minute about what this leads to .
Here &apos;s a cluster of gelatin — a mile and a half of gelatin that you can hold on the palm of your hand and that can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
It can contemplate the sense of infinity and it can contemplate itself as it contempts the sense of infinity .
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the Holy Grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and one day , we hope , we &apos;ll understand how this happens .
OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
I mean , there are 100 billion nerve cells , little packets of protoplasma interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the entire spectrum of skills that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How does that happen ?
So , there are many ways to investigate the functions of the human brain .
One approach , what we prepare most of all , is to study patients who have suffered important damage to a small area of the brain , where there was a genetic modification in a small area of the brain .
What happens is not an improvisation reduction of all the mental abilities , sort of a weakening of cognitive abilities .
It turns out that loss is strongly selective in a function while other functions are intact , and that allows us to say with a certain confidence that that part of the brain is involved in mediation of that function .
So we can map the function of the structure , and then find out what the circuit is doing to generate that particular function .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
Let me show you some suggestive examples .
In this talk I &apos;m going to show you three examples , six minutes each .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
If you look at the first slide , here &apos;s the temporal lobe , the frontal lobes , the parietal lobes , OK , the lobes that make up the brain .
And if you look , it &apos;s hidden inside the inner surface of the temporal lobe — you can &apos;t see it , there &apos;s a little structure called fusiform .
They called it the facial area of the brain because when it &apos;s damaged , you don &apos;t recognize people &apos;s faces anymore .
You can still recognize them from your voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , it &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at them in your face and know who it is , you know ?
You can &apos;t even recognize them in the mirror .
I mean , you know you &apos;re because if you squeeze the eye , he pulls it up , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself .
OK . Now they know that that syndrome is caused by damage to fusiform .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , actually so rare that very few doctors , and even neurologists , have never heard it .
It &apos;s called the Capgras illusion , and that is a patient who for the rest is completely normal had a head injury , comes out of the coma completely normal in everything else , looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This woman looks like my mother , but she &apos;s an entrepreneur .
It &apos;s another woman pretending she &apos;s my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
How come — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent all over the rest , but when he sees his mother , the illusion hits and he says he &apos;s not the mother .
Now , the most common interpretation that is in all psychiatry manual , is a Freudian vision , and that is that this guy — the same thing is true for women , but I &apos;m just going to talk about men .
When you were a kid , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
This is the so-called Freudian Edipo complex .
I &apos;m not saying to believe it , but this is the standard Freudian perspective .
Then when you grow up , the cortex develops , and it inhibits these latent sexual pulses to your mother .
Thank God , otherwise you would all be sexually excited when you see your mother .
And what happens is that you have a stroke on your head , which damages the cortex , and these latent sexual pulses emerge , they come to the surface , suddenly and without any reason you &apos;re sexually excited by your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I get sexually excited ?
It &apos;s a few other women . It &apos;s an entrepreneur . &quot; &quot; This is the only sensed interpretation for your lesbian brain .
And this has never seemed to make sense to me .
It &apos;s very ingenious , like all freudian topics — ( Laughter ) — but it never seemed very good to me because I saw the same illusion in a patient with the same illusion towards her baby . ( Laughter )
He says , &quot; &quot; Dr. , this is not Fuffy , it looks perfectly like Fuffy , but it &apos;s another dog . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
Now try to use the Freudian explanation .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re going to start talking about the latent beast of all human beings , or something like that , which is obviously quite absurd .
So what &apos;s really happening ?
To explain this curious disorder , we go and look at the structure and function of normal visual pathways in the brain .
Normally visual signals go inside the eye bulbs and get to the visual areas of the brain .
In fact , there are 30 areas in the back of the brain that are only about vision , and when everything has been processed , the message comes to a little structure called a fusiform loop , where you perceive faces .
There are neurons that are sensitive to faces .
You can call it the facial area of the brain , right ?
I talked about it before .
Now , when that area is damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
But from that area , the message comes from within a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional center of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , defines the emotional meaning of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it a prey ? Is it a predator ? A friend ?
Or is it something completely insignificant , like a piece of cigarette , or a chalk , or a — I don &apos;t mean that but — or a shoe , or something like that ? Okay ?
Something you can completely ignore .
So if the amygdala is excited , and this is important , the message can get to the autonomous nervous system .
The heart starts to beat harder .
You start sweating to dissipate the heat you &apos;re about to create — because of the muscle effort .
And we &apos;re lucky , because we can put two electrodes on the palm of our hand and measure the variation in cutanic resistance produced by sweating .
So I can determine , as you look at something , if you &apos;re excited or not , okay ?
I &apos;ll get there in a minute .
So my idea was that when this guy looks at an object , any object , the message goes to the visual areas and — by the way , it &apos;s processed in the fusiform and recognizes it as a piselli plant or a table or its mother , right ?
And then the message goes to the amygdala and then to the autonomous nervous system .
But perhaps in this guy , the link that goes from amygdala to the limbic system — the center of emotion in the brain — was interrupted by trauma .
So , since the fusiform tour is intact , the guy can still recognize his mother and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yes , he looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But since the link to the emotions centers is cut , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , doesn &apos;t warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , depending on the case ? Right ?
( Laughter ) So he says , &quot; &quot; How do I explain this mysterious lack of emotion ?
&quot; &quot; This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman who pretends to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test it ?
This is how you do , if you take one of you and you put it in front of a screen , and you measure the galvanic resistance of the skin , and you show images on the screen , I can measure how much you sweat when you see an object , like a table or a hammer — of course , don &apos;t sweep .
If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pin-up , then you start sweating , right ?
And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
You don &apos;t even have to be Jews .
( Laughter ) Now , what happens — what happens if you show them to this patient ?
Take the patient and show them images on the screen and measure the galvanic resistance of his skin .
Tables and cigarettes , nothing happens , like in normal people , but when you show them an image of her mother , the galvanic resistance of her skin is flat .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother because the link between visual areas and emotion centers is interrupted .
So her vision is normal because visual areas are normal , her emotions are normal — laughter , crying and so forth — but the link between vision and emotions is interrupted , and so she has the illusion that her mother is an imposer .
It &apos;s a wonderful example of the kinds of things that we do is we take a bizarre , almost incomprehensible neurological psychiatric syndrome , and we say that standard Freudian vision is wrong , that we can actually provide a precise explanation in terms of neural anatomy known about the brain .
By the way , if this patient goes , and the mother calls him from an adjacent room — the phone calls — and he answers the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , Mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no illusion through the phone .
And then she comes up to him after an hour and he says , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
You really look like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
The reason for that is that there &apos;s a separate way that goes from hearing centers in the brain to emotion centers that have not been interrupted by trauma .
This explains why through the phone recognizes her mother , without any problems .
When she sees it firsthand , she says it &apos;s an entrepreneur .
OK , so how is this complex circuit organized in the brain ?
Is it nature , genes , or is it culture ?
And we approach this problem by looking at another curious syndrome called a ghost limb .
And you all know what a ghost limb is .
If an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for a bark , or is lost in war , for example , in the Iraq War — it &apos;s becoming a serious problem — you continue to feel vividly the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a ghost arm or a ghost leg .
In fact , you can have a ghost of any part of the body .
Believe it or not , even with faces .
I had patients with the utero removed — hysterectomy — cha have a ghost utero , ghost cramps , including in the right period of the month .
And in fact , one student asked me the other day , do they even have PMS ?
( Laughter ) A mature topic for scientific investigation , but we didn &apos;t go on .
OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about ghost arts through experiments ?
One of the things we found was that about half of the patients with ghost limbs say they can move the ghost .
He puts a poop on his shoulder to his brother , responds to his phone when he squares , he makes lifelong pigs .
These are very winning , vivid feelings .
The patient doesn &apos;t have an illusion .
He knows that the arm is not there , but nonetheless , it &apos;s a winning sensory experience for the patient .
But anyway , in about half of the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
The ghost limb — they say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the ghost limb is paralyzed .
It &apos;s set in a snaked sasm , and it &apos;s atrocally painful .
If I could only move it , maybe pain would be alleviated . Now , why would a ghost limb be paralyzed ?
It looks like a symbol .
But when we look at the clinical record , what we find is that in these people with paralyzed ghost limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the damage to peripheral nerves .
The arm nerve had been damaged , cut by , say , a motorcycle accident .
So the patient had a real arm , which was painful , in a blindfold for a few months , or a year , and then in the unhappy attempt to eliminate the pain in the arm , the surgeon will expand his arm and then you have a ghost arm with the same pain , right ?
And this is a very serious clinical problem .
Patients depress .
Some of them are pushed to suicide , OK ?
So how is this syndrome ?
Now why do we have a paralyzed fantasy limb ?
When I looked at the medical record , I found that they had an arm whose nerves had been cut , and the arm had been paralyzed and slaughtered in a blindfold for several months before the amputation and that pain is transferred to the ghost itself .
Why is that ?
When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain was sending commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it got visual feedback that said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Get out . No . Move . No . Move . No . No .
And the mechanism is impressed in the circuits of the brain , and we call it the learning paralysis , OK ?
The brain learns through this association link by Hebb , that the command itself to move the arm creates the feeling of the paralyzed arm .
And then , when the arm was amputated , this learning paralysis is transferred — the image of the body and the ghost , OK ?
Now , how can you help these patients ?
How do you distill the paralysis that you &apos;ve learned so that you can liberate them from this atrocist spasm of the ghost arm ?
Well , we said , what if you could send the command to the ghost , and give them the visual feedback that &apos;s obligating to the command , right ?
Maybe you could raise the pain of the ghost , the cramp of the ghost .
How do you do that ? VR .
But that costs millions of dollars .
So I found a way to do it with three dollars , but don &apos;t tell the companies that fund me .
( Laughter ) OK ? I created what I call a mirror box .
You take a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and you put the ghost in there — and my first patient , Derek , came to me .
His arm was amputated 10 years ago .
He suffered a brachial vulsion , the nerves were cut , and the arm was paralyzed , steepy in a blindfold , and then it was amputated .
He had a ghost arm , atrocally painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
It was a paralyzed fantasy arm .
He came to me and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , the mirror box , right ?
And the patient puts his left ghost arm , which is tightly held in a sasm , to the left of the mirror , and his normal arm on the right of the mirror in the same position , in the narrow position in a pasm , and looks in the mirror and what does he experience ?
He sees the phantom resource because he sees the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it &apos;s like the ghost is asset .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Now look , move the ghost — your real fingers , or move your real fingers as you look in the mirror . &quot; &quot; It will have the visual experience that the ghost is moving , right ?
This is obvious , but the amazing thing is that the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my fantasy moves again and pain , the staggering sasm , it &apos;s breathed . &quot; &quot; And remember , it was my first patient — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came and looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at the reflection of your ghost . &quot; And he started laughing , but I can &apos;t see it .
It knows it &apos;s a reflection in the mirror , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and your fantasy . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Or , I can &apos;t move the ghost . You know . It hurts . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Take your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my fantasy moves again , I can &apos;t believe it !
And my pain is raised . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
And then I said to him , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closed his eyes .
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
&quot; Oh , nothing — it &apos;s paralyzed again . &quot;
&quot; Okay , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , or my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
It was just like a kid in a sweet store .
I said , OK , this confirms my theory of learning paralysis and the important role of visual input , but I won &apos;t get a Nobel Prize for getting someone to move their ghost limb .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless skill , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But then I started to realize that maybe other forms of paralysis that we see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonia — can have an understanding component that you can overcome with the simple use of a mirror .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — first of all , the guy can &apos;t take a mirror around to alleviate the pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and exercise for a week or two .
Maybe , after a period of practice , you can do less than the mirror , distill the paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then get rid of the pain . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; OK , and he took it home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s just two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So he took him home and after two weeks , he called me , &quot; &quot; Dr. , he won &apos;t believe us . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought the mirror was missing .
( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; No , no , no , you know the ghost I &apos;ve had in the last 10 years ? &quot;
It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; And I — I worried , I said , my God I mean , I changed the body image of this individual , what happens at the level of human subjects , ethics and all that ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bothering you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , in the last three days I haven &apos;t had the ghost arm , and so no pain in the ghost elbow , no sworm , no pain in the ghost arm , all the pain is gone .
But the problem is , I still have the ghost toes hanging out of my shoulder , and the little box doesn &apos;t get there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So it could change design and put it on my forehead so that I could eliminate my ghost fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was kind of a magician .
Now , why does this happen ?
It &apos;s because the brain is confronted with tremendous sensory conflict .
They get messages from vision , which says the ghost has come back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no adequate perception , the muscle signals say there &apos;s no arm , right ?
And the motor commands say the arm is there , and in this conflict the brain says , &quot; &quot; Ah , hell , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no ghost , there &apos;s no arm , right ?
It goes into a kind of denial — it denies signals .
And when the arm disappears , the bonus is that the pain disappears , you can &apos;t have some pain flowing through space .
So this is bonus .
Now , this technique has been proven on dozens of patients from other groups in Helsinki and seems as valid as treating fantasy pain , and already , other people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
The stroke , you think of it as a fiber damage , nothing can be done about it .
But it turns out that a part of the ictus paralysis is also learning paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
And it &apos;s also tested in clinical trials , helping many , many patients .
OK , let me turn to the third part of my talk , which is another strange phenomenon called synesthesia .
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the 19th century .
It was a Charles Darwin &apos;s cousin .
He pointed out that some people in the population , who were completely normal , had the following peculiarity — all the time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is sweet , nine is induced , OK ?
Remember , these people are completely normal for other aspects .
Or C diesis . Sometimes the notes evoke a color .
C diesis is is blue , F diesis is is green , another pitch could be yellow , right ?
Why is this happening ?
This is called synesthesia — Galton called it synesthesia , a mixture of senses .
In us , all the senses are distinct .
These people mix their senses .
Why is this happening ?
One of the two aspects of this problem is very intriguing .
The synesthesia runs into the families , so Galton said he had an inherited base , a genetic base .
Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this brings me to the main theme of this conference , which is creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , writers and creative people than in normal people .
Why ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
Well , there are many theories .
One theory is they &apos;re crazy .
It &apos;s not very scientific , so we can forget it .
Another theory is that they &apos;re drugs , right ?
Now , there might be a peanut of truth because it &apos;s much more common here , in San Francisco Bay than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia ? All right ?
So what we find is that the area of colors and the area of numbers are actually attached to the brain , in fusiform .
And we concluded that there are accidental connections between color and numbers in the brain .
So every time you see a number , you see the corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you have synesthesia .
Now remember — why is this happening ?
Why should there be these connections in some people ?
Remember that I said it runs into families ?
That gives you the clue .
There &apos;s an anormal gene , a mutated gene that causes these anormal connections .
All of us , apparently , are born with everything connected to everything else .
So every area of the brain is connected to all the other areas , and these are potatoes to create the modular architecture of the adult brain .
So if there &apos;s a gene that causes this potatorial and if the gene mutates , then we have a scarce potato between areas of the nearby brain .
And if it &apos;s numbers and colors , we &apos;ll have a numeri-color synesthesia .
If it &apos;s between sounds and colors , we &apos;ll have color synesthesia .
So far , that &apos;s fine .
Now , if this gene expresses throughout the brain and everything is interconnected ?
Well , think about what artists and writers and poets have in common , the ability to think metaphorically , connecting seemingly disconnected ideas , like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Eastern , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; You say Juliet is the sun — does that mean it &apos;s a bright fire ball ?
Of course , schizophrenics do that , but that &apos;s another story , right ?
A normal one says it &apos;s warm like the sun , spinning like the sun , welcoming like the sun .
Istantaneously you found the connections .
Now , if we assume that the vast number of connections and concepts also express in other parts of the brain , then it will create a greater propensity to metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
From here , incidence eight times more synesthesia between poets , artists and writers .
OK — that &apos;s a very frantic view of synesthesia .
The last demonstration — can I have a minute ?
( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all honest , even if you deny it .
I call this the Martian alphabet , just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C .
Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
Here you have the Martian alphabet .
One of them is Kiki , one is a bouba .
What is Kiki and what is bouba ?
Who here thinks this is Kiki and this is bouba ? Raise your hands .
Well , we have one or two mutants .
( Laughter ) Those of you who think this is bouba , this is Kiki ? Raise your hands .
99 percent of you .
Now , none of you are Martian , how did you do that ?
It &apos;s because all of you make a connection — synesthetic abstraction — meaning , say that that inflection acute , Kiki , in the auditory cortex , the ciliate cells that are aroused , Kiki , the visual inflection — all of a sudden change — of that dental form .
This is very important , because it tells you that your brain comes back primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a stupid illusion , but photons in your eye draw this shape , and the cells that are blind in your ear arousing auditory pathways , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and now we know that this happens in the fusiform of the brain because when it &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to distinguish bouba Kiki but they also lose the ability to understand metaphors .
If I ask this individual , &quot; &quot; Not everything that shines is gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and bright , it &apos;s not said to be gold . &quot;
You have to measure the specific weight , OK ? These completely lose the metaphorical meaning .
So this area is eight times larger in high school — especially in humans , than in the lower primates .
Something very interesting happens here in the angular twist , because it &apos;s the crossword between hearing and touch , and it &apos;s become huge in humans — and something very interesting happens .
And I think it &apos;s the basis of many uniquely human abilities such as abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
All of these questions , that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists start exploring them through neuroimagery , studying patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
14 years ago , I first discovered this common material , fishing networks , used in the same way for centuries .
Today , I use it to create vultures , permanent , peaceful forms of buildings in cities around the world .
I was an unlikely person to do these things .
I &apos;ve never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after high school , I ran into seven art school and I was discarded by all seven .
I became an artist on my own , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fullbright scholarship for India .
By proposing to make paintings of paint , I sent my paintings and came to Mahabalipuram .
The deadline for the exhibition came — my paintings didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
The fisherman village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried to hit the bronze .
But making big forms was too heavy and expensive .
I went for a walk in the beach , looking at the fishermen infiltrating their nets into the sand piles .
I would look at them every day , but that time I saw them differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way of making volumetric shapes without solid materials .
My first acceptable sculpture was done in collaboration with a fisherman .
It &apos;s a self-portrait called &quot; &quot; Bacino off . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) We put it on the wings to photograph it .
I found their soft surfaces that reveal every wind ridge that constantly changes the appearance of the surfaces .
I was mesmerized .
I kept studying artisanal traditions working with craftsmen , later in Lituania with pig manufacturers .
I loved the particular delicate that they gave to my work , but I wanted to make them bigger — to go from being an object looking at something to lose .
And then I went back to India to work with those fishermen , we made a network of a million and a half facts made by hand — exposed briefly to Madrid .
Thousands of people saw this , and one of them was the Manual Sola-Morales urbanist who was redesigning the long boat in Porto , Portugal .
He asked me if I could build it as a permanent element for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I was able to do that by preserving my art .
Duraturo , engineered , permanent — these are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and actual .
For two years , I looked for a fiber that could resist ultraviolet rays , saltwater , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly into the wind .
We needed something to keep the network in the middle of the round .
So we pulled up this ring from over 22 tons .
We had to build it to make it move harmoniously in the breeze and resist hurricanes .
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and mobile .
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who was designing for the competition boats of America &apos;s Cup called Peter Heppel .
It helped me deal with the double challenge for a precise form and a delicate movement .
I couldn &apos;t build it as I knew how to do , because the hand-made nodes wouldn &apos;t be resistant to hurricane .
So I narrowed a relationship with an industrial manufacturer of networks , and I learned what the variables of their machines are , and I discovered a way to make the network .
There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic craftsmanship into something that could be produced by machines .
We had to create it .
Three years and two children later , we pulled up a network of 4,600 square meters .
It was hard to believe that what I imagined was built , permanent without losing anything in its transposition .
( Applause ) This crossroads was blinding and anonymous .
So it made sense in that place .
I walked under it for the first time .
As I looked at the disfolding of wind choreographies , I felt protected and , at the same time , connected with the infinite sky .
My life would no longer be the same .
I want to create these oasis of sculptures in cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to take two directions that are new to my work .
The Storetical murder of Philadelphia : it &apos;s a square , which I heard , needed a sculpture material that was lighter than the network .
So we &apos;ve been experimenting with little atomized water particles to create a dry fog that takes shape with the wind , and in doing the testing , we &apos;ve discovered that it can be formed by people who can interact and move in without getting wet .
I use this material to sculpt to track subway paths above the ground in real time — like a X-ray of the city &apos;s circulation system .
Next challenge , the American Biennial in Denver asked me if I could present the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnections in a sculpture .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to start , but I agreed .
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that disfolded across the Pacific Ocean .
He moved the tectonic plates of the Earth , accelerated the rotation of the planet and literally shorted the length of the day .
So I contacted NOAA , and I asked them to share the tsunami data , and translated it into this .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; 1.26 , &quot; &quot; which refers to the number of microseconds that a day on Earth has come along .
I couldn &apos;t build it with a steel ring , the way I knew how to do it .
His shape was too complex .
So I replaced the metal armor with a reticated soft of a fiber 15 times more resistant than steel .
The sculpture now could be entirely soft , which made it so light that you could tie to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
There were no software that could extract these complex forms and model them with gravity .
We had to create it .
Then I got a call from the city of New York asking if I could fit these concepts to Times Square or Highline .
This new , soft structural method allows me to model and build these sculptures at the scale of a skyscraper .
They don &apos;t have the funds yet , but I dream now to take them to cities around the world where they need more .
14 years ago , I was looking for beauty in traditional things , craftsmanship forms .
And now I &apos;m going to combine them with high-tech and engineering materials to create voluntary and peaceful forms of the size of buildings .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;m going to leave you with this story .
I got a phone call from a friend of Phoenix .
A lawyer in the office who never became interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone in the building and took them out to lie under the sculpture .
They were all in jacket and tie , lying on the lawn , catching the changes of wind data before people who didn &apos;t know , sharing the rebellion of wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
To read this slide , you have to look for your age on the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we fall out of the graph .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
When I was a child ...
This was my team .
I didn &apos;t like to make them , I didn &apos;t like to look at them .
So that &apos;s what I was doing . I was sweeping .
All of my teenage age age , I fished on the coast of Connecticut , and these are the creatures I saw regularly .
But after I grew up and went to university , and I came home in the early 1990s , this is what I found .
My team had shrunk .
It was like having your own broken brigade .
And so when I got more or less investigated , from a personal point of view , as a fisherman , I started to wonder what the rest of the world thought of .
I first looked at fish markets .
And when I went to the markets , I was standing here , whether it was in North Carolina , or in Paris , London , everywhere , I kept seeing this strange group of four creatures repeating , over and over again , over the menus , over the ice : shrimp , tuna , salmon and cod .
And I found it weird , and as I looked at it , I was wondering , did anyone else notice this reduction of the fish available ?
Well , as I investigated , I realized that people didn &apos;t see them as a team .
The normal people saw fish like this .
It &apos;s not an unusual human feature to reduce the natural world to a few elements .
We &apos;ve done it 10,000 years ago , when we &apos;ve come out of caves .
If we look at the fire buffs 10,000 years ago , we &apos;ll see procedures , wolves , we &apos;ll see all kinds of different creatures .
But if we go on to 2,000 years ago , we &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
The same for birds .
If you look at the restaurant menus of New York City , 150 , 200 years ago , we &apos;ll see cats , beaks , cedron galli , tens of papers and odes .
But let &apos;s jump forward , in modern farming , and we &apos;ll see four species : cousins , ducks , chickens and geese .
So it &apos;s normal to go in this direction .
But how did that happen ?
Well ...
It &apos;s a very new problem .
This is how we &apos;ve fished in the oceans in the last 50 years .
The Second World War incentivized a war against fish .
The technology that we refined in World War II , sonar , light polymers , all of these things have been redirected on fish .
So you see a huge increase in the amount of fishing , which has quadrupled over time , since the end of the Second World War to today .
That means we &apos;re talking about 80 , 90 million tons of fish every year .
It &apos;s the equivalent of the human weight of China taken off the sea every year .
And it &apos;s not a coincidence that I use China as an example : China is now the largest fisherman in the world .
That &apos;s only half the story .
The other half of the story is this incredible boom in petrol and aquaculture , which now , just in the last couple of years , started to overcome the amount of fishing .
So if we combine the amount of fish that &apos;s grown to fish , we get the equivalent of twice as much as China gets from the ocean every year .
And again , it &apos;s not a coincidence that I use China as an example , because , in addition to being the biggest fisherman , it &apos;s also the largest farmer .
So let &apos;s look at the four choices we &apos;re making now .
The first : the most consumed fish in America and most of the West , is the shrimp .
Fish shrimp , not farmed , are a terrible product .
2.5 to 7.5 kilograms of unraised fish are killed regularly to carry two pounds of shrimp to the market .
It then spends a lot of oil to put it on the market .
The Dalhouse University found , in a recent study , that draging the bottom to catch shrimp is one of the most polluting fishing methods .
So you can farm , and they &apos;re raised , a lot of them are raised in this area .
The problem is ...
The places where shrimp are raised are wild habitats , like mangrove forests .
Look at these beautiful roots .
They keep the soil compact , they protect the shores , they create habitats for the smallest fish , the shrimp , all important aspects for the environment .
Well , this is what happens in many mangrove forests .
We &apos;ve lost millions of hectares of mangrove over the last 30 to 40 years .
The destruction rate has declined , but the lack of mangrove is still high .
The other thing that &apos;s happening is the phenomenon that Mark Benjamin , the filmmaker , called &quot; &quot; Nemo Police . &quot; &quot; This phenomenon is very important for everything you see in the coral reef .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s happening , there are boats that are draging the bottom , causing bad cessories , and the waste fish is being slaughtered and turned into food for shrimp .
And sometimes , a lot of vessels , driven by slaves , fish these fish , called &quot; &quot; trash fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would like to see in coral reefs and slaughter them , turning them into shrimp food . A cannibal ecosystem to produce shrimp .
The other most consumed fish in the United States , and all over the West , is tuna .
The tuna is the global fish for excellence .
You have to look at these huge natural fishing reserves to really understand tuna .
Our fisheries Management Organization resource is called ICCAT : International Commission for the Atlantic Convention .
The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it &quot; The International Complex for the Horn . &quot;
We &apos;ve seen an improvement in ICCAT over the last few years . You can definitely improve , but you have to say tuna is a global fish , and to manage it , we have to be able to manage the world .
We could try to farm tuna , but tuna is a bad animal for aquaculture .
Many people don &apos;t know that tuna has warm blood .
Its temperature can overcome over 20 C , its environment temperature . The tuna can swim over 40 miles an hour .
So this factor lists all the benefits of breeding fish , right ?
Farmed fish are cold because they don &apos;t move very much .
It &apos;s perfect , because they have more proteins .
If you have this crazy , wild creature , swimming 40 miles an hour , and warm blood , you don &apos;t really have a good aquaculture candidate .
The next creature , the most consumed fish in America and the West , is salmon .
The salmon was also abused , but not necessarily fishing .
Here &apos;s my state , Connecticut .
Connecticut used to be rich in wild salmon .
But if you look at this map of Connecticut , every point is a dam .
There are over 3,000 dishes in Connecticut .
I often say that &apos;s why people there are so nervous — ( Laughter ) If someone could unlock the Connecticut people , I think we could have a better world .
I made this comment in a conveyor of national parks , and a man from North Carolina approaches me , saying to me , &quot; &quot; You know , it shouldn &apos;t be that hard with his Connecticut , because we in North Carolina have 35,000 dishes . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national epidemic , an international epidemic .
And there are algae everywhere , and this is exactly what keeps the salmon from depositing the eggs .
So we folded on aquaculture and , by judging numbers , salmon is one of the greatest successes .
When you started farming the salmon , it took about three kilograms of unraised fish to produce half a kilogram of salmon .
You have to say that industry has improved .
The ratio went down to one , even though it &apos;s a bit of a lie , because if you look at the way food is produced , it &apos;s measured in pellet , kilograms of pellets per pound of salmon .
These pellets are smaller fish .
So the real result , called FIFO , the fish that worked and sold , is hard to indicate .
Whatever it is , the industry has reduced the relationship between salmon raised and finite product .
The problem is that we &apos;re crazy with the amount of salmon we produce .
aquaculture is the food system growing faster .
It &apos;s growing at a rate of seven percent a year .
And even if we raise less fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still killing a lot of small fish .
And it &apos;s not just the fish that we feed to other fish , we feed fish in meal to chickens and pigs .
So we have chickens that eat fish , but interestingly , we have fish that eat chickens .
Because the bottom product is poisonous , feathers , blood , bone , is slaughtered and fed to fish .
I often wonder , is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish ?
It &apos;s kind of like a chicken rehabilitation and an egg . ( Laughter ) All together , though , it turns out to be a disaster .
We &apos;re talking about a figure between 20 and 30 million tons of wild creatures , which are taken out of the ocean that &apos;s used and slaughtered .
It &apos;s the equivalent of a third of China or all the U.S. inhabitants , which is taken out of the sea every year .
The last of the four guys is sort of a loving thing .
At first , the sandwich prepared for halias .
It all began because in a fast local food , when the operator discovered that Friday nobody came .
It was a Catholic community , and they had to eat fish .
So he went to Ray Kroc and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to take you a sandwich with the fish , ready with halias . &quot;
Ray Kroc said , &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work . &quot;
I &apos;d like to make a Hula Burger , bread and a piece of ananas .
We do this , we bet .
The sandwich that will sell more will be the winner . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s very sad for the sea that the Hula Burger won .
So he made his halias sandwich .
Unfortunately , the sandwich was 30 cents .
Ray wanted it to cost 25 , so he opted for the Atlantic cod .
We know what was the Atlantic cod in New England .
So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is prepared with yellow cod in Alaska , and it &apos;s the largest fish fishery industry in the United States between one and 1.5 billion pounds of fish are taken out of the sea every year .
If we finish the yellow cod , the next option is probably the tilapia .
No one had ever heard of this fish 20 years ago .
It &apos;s an effective convertor of vegetable proteins in animal protein , and it &apos;s a gift of the sky for the third world .
It &apos;s actually a very sustainable solution , from an egg to an adult individual in nine months .
The problem is that when you look in the West , tilapia doesn &apos;t do what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t have what you can think of as a blue fish .
It doesn &apos;t have EPA and Omega-3 , which everybody thinks will make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , first of all , what do we do for poor sardine ?
This fish is a large part of those 20 or 30 million tons .
Well , one possibility many environmentalists found was , &quot; &quot; Could we eat them ?
Could we eat them , instead of feeding them to the lungs ?
There are arguments about this .
They &apos;re also rich in Omega-3 , a great source of EPA and DHA .
So they would be a property .
And if we were to take that road , I would say , instead of paying a few dollars a kilogram , or a ton , and make it a fish feed , we could halve the fish and double the price for fishermen , and make that our way of treating that fish ?
Another possibility , though , which is much more interesting , is to look at whales , particularly heights .
The heights are rich with EPA and DHA , like tuna in the box .
They &apos;re low-energy .
For one kilogram of heights on the market , you use a third of the greenhouse gases required for the same amount of meat .
They don &apos;t require foraging fish , they take their homega-3 by filtering water for microalgae .
That &apos;s where omega-3 comes from , not from fish .
It &apos;s microalgae that make homega-3 , fish are just bioconcentrated .
Civalae and bivalae filter a lot of water .
One coat can filter dozens of liters every day .
This is extremely important when we look at the world .
Today , nitrification , excessive use of phosphates in waterways causes algae to flourish .
Over 400 new dead zones have been created over the last 20 years , the cause of disappearing many marine creatures .
We may not even look at fish .
Consider the vegetables .
We look at algae , all variety that can contain a lot of omega-3 , have a lot of proteins , all things that really do well .
They suck water like heights .
And interestingly , you can feed cows .
I &apos;m not a big fan of cows .
If you want to keep farming cows today that water resources are limited , algae grow in the water , you don &apos;t have to cut them down , an important consideration .
And the last fish , it &apos;s a question point .
We have the ability to create aquaculture , and that creates an increase in marine protein for us .
This creature should be vegetarian , it should grow fast , it should adapt to climate change , and it should be a blue fish , the kind of blue fish with EPA , DHA , homega-3 that we look for .
There &apos;s more or less on paper .
I &apos;ve been doing services on these arguments for 15 years .
Every time I do a new service , someone says , &quot; &quot; We can do all this . We can do this . We have a solution .
We can create a fish full of marine protein and with homega-3 . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s great .
The idea , though , doesn &apos;t seem to develop .
It &apos;s time for him to do it .
If we do that , 30 million tons of fish , a third of the fishing , it will remain in the sea .
So what I &apos;m saying is that this is the way we follow .
We follow our appetite more than our head .
But if we take this path , we might have a lot more .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I became almost a little girl in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , you know obviously that the two hemispheres are completely separate from each other .
Sorry . Thank you . It was a joy . Assistant : Even for me .
The information , in the form of energy , flows simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then explode in this huge collage that we &apos;re living through , from its perfume and its taste , from its texture and its sound .
I am an energy being connected to energy around me through the awareness of my right hemisphere .
And right now we &apos;re perfect , we &apos;re the whole and we &apos;re beautiful .
My left hemisphere — our left brain — is a very different place .
Our left hemisphere thinks linear and methodically .
And our left hemisphere thinks through language .
And all I could detect was this energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with this ?
And I felt my body lighter . And imagine .
