By the end of this year , there will be almost one billion people on the planet who are actively using social networks .
What they all recognize is they will die .
That seems a morbid thought , but I think he provides some pretty profound implications that justify a higher view .
I think about it since I read a blog entry from Derek K. Miller , who was science and technology journalist , who died of cancer .
And Miller brought his family and friends to write an entry that was published just after his death .
Here &apos;s the instruction .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s it , I &apos;m dead , and this is the last entry in my blog .
In advance , I &apos;ve asked myself that once my body is finally distinguished the punishment of my cancer , my family and friends publish this proven message from me — as the first part of a process that makes an archive out of this active website . &quot; &quot; Now , while Miller was a journalist , wrote his archive better , and more careful than most , it is that we &apos;re all creating an archive today .
A few numbers .
Right now , 48 hours of film is uploaded to YouTube — every minute !
200 million tweets are posted every day .
The average Facebook user creates 90 entries every month .
If you think about your parents or grandparents , at best , they &apos;ve created some photos or homework videos , or a diary that wraps in a box .
But today , we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that will still exist in the cloud for years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think this creates some incredibly fascinating opportunities for technologists .
So to make it clear , I &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so I want to design a sketch for a moment what the present and the future will look like .
We &apos;re already seeing some of the references designed to make us decide what happens to our online profiles and concerts at social media after we die .
One of them made me feel appropriate when I was talking about Foursquare in a Delhi restaurant in New York .
( Recording ) Adam East row : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : Death can get you anywhere , any time , even in the biolades .
AO : Who is that ?
Death : Get on ifida before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam East row : Something kind of sad , isn &apos;t it ?
What this offer is good , simply said , it lets you design a message or a video that can be posted after your death on Facebook .
Another offer is called 1,000 memories .
And it makes you create a linear homage to your loved ones completely with photographs , videos and stories you can put online after you died .
But the next thing I find is far more interesting .
Many of you probably know Deb Roy , who showed in March how he could analyze over 90,000 hours of private film reviews .
I believe that machines can get better access to human language , and more and more and more data sets , it will be possible to analyze the origins of a whole life — the tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog entries — that we produce in such an incredible number .
And I think if that happens , it will be possible for our digital personality to interact with the real world for a long time after our gut , thanks to the inmeasurable amount of content that we create , and the ability of technology to make sense of it .
We can see experiments in this already .
A supply called &quot; &quot; My Next Tweet &quot; &quot; analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve ever posted on Twitter , and makes predictions of what you might say next .
Now , right now , as you see here , the results are kind of crude .
You can imagine what this looks like in five , 10 or 20 years , with enhanced technical opportunities .
So to go one step further : the Media Lab at MIT is working on robots that are similar to people .
But what if interactions could be based on the unique features of a particular person ? On the basis of hundreds of thousands of ingredients that this person produced in their lives .
Think about the very famous scene of electoral eight over here in the United States , when CNN launched a live hologram of the hip-hop artist , and projected it to their studio , to the interview of Anderson Cooper .
What if we could use the same technology to get a representation of our loved ones into our living room — that interacts very close to life based on all the content that they created in their lifetime ?
I think this will be absolutely possible because the amount of data that we use , and the ability of technology to understand these will grow exponentially .
And finally , I think we all have to think about whether we want our reality to be — and if what it means for our idea of life and for everything that comes after that .
Thank you very much .

( Guitar roll ) ( Singing ) roller coaster , Karussell .
You can grab the ring , you can run the bell when the ride ends , you never know .
People tell you , this one thing — does your life completely .
So you give your best and you land on the street .
Then you wake up one day and they tell you , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a queen . &quot; &quot; But then you realize someone else is pulling the strings .
This is roller coaster .
Where the heights are heaven , but the depths oh , they can be the hell .
Where the heights are heaven , but the depths oh , they can be the hell .
Maybe I &apos;m just zynic and all these words are lying , but the experience teaches me that the intention is wise .
But careful carries you to the hesitation , and who hits you is lost , so your chances and never take the prize .
This is roller coaster .

Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Today I &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar industry .
And my little startup wants us to force ourselves to conservation by ...

Here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
Oh . A moment .
It may take you until it &apos;s charged .
( Laughter ) Now — we can just jump this over — I &apos;m just going to skip the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )

Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
Oh , my time is over ?
Okay . Thank you .

It was on a afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
So I went to visit my colleague Chris Hansen in his office .
Chris has been working on ACLU for more than 30 years , so he knew very well in our organization .
I just studied some cases in the tension field of science and civil rights — really exciting .
But I found that the ACLU should do these subjects much more basic to really change something .
Chris asked me very directly , &quot; What are the five most important topics you &apos;re working on right now ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , patents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You tell me that the U.S. government gives patents to the parts of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be true . &quot; &quot; I went to my office and sent Chris three articles .
20 minutes later , he was crashing into my office .
&quot; To God ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we sue ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Chris is a brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and nothing about genetics .
I knew a lot about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t a lawyer , let alone patent attorney .
First , we had to understand exactly what was patented when somebody patented a gene .
The patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of them is the so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — specifically , a piece of DNA that was taken from a cell .
And the patents were not just for certain isolated genes , but for all kinds of variants of these genes .
What does that mean ?
That also means that the patent holder can ban anybody to use the gene in research or clinical tests .
But the company got infected and never offered the test .
Genpatents clearly were a problem , and they were harming patients .
But was there a way to inflate them ?
You cannot patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
These things are too fundamental , they have to be free for everybody , and they have to be not allowed to be kept .
It seemed to us that the DNA , the basic structure of life , which is for production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a natural law , whether it &apos;s in our bodies or in the reaggeration glass .
Most of us were basically right , at least theoretically legal .
Why is that ?
There were literally thousands of patents on the human genome .
We started working with our lawsuit .
We looked for a patent holder who did his patents with all the power , and we created a broad alliance of classes and experts who could explain the court on which these patents could harm patients and innovations .
The main candidate for a lawsuit was Myriad Genetics , a company in Salt Lake City in Utah .
Women with certain mutations on these genes have a much higher risk of getting breast cancer or ovarian cancer .
Clinic data was no longer shared with the international science community .
Probably the most obvious : For several years , Myriad refused to expand the test to extend additional mutations that identified a team of researchers in France .
This is Kathleen Maxan .
Kathleen &apos;s sister , Eileen , with 40 years of breast cancer , Eileen was tested by Myriad .
The test was negative .
The family was relieved .
That meant that Eileen &apos;s cancer was probably not essential , and other family members didn &apos;t need to be tested .
Kathleen &apos;s sister was under the 12 percent that got a false negative result .
If Eileen had received the right outcome , you would have tested Cathleen , your ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
One of the biggest challenges in preparation was how we best bring the scientific standpoint .
To make persuasion that Myriad did not invent , and that isolated BRCA genes were a product of nature , we had to explain a series of principles like , what is a gene ? What is DNA ?
How is DNA isolated , and why isn &apos;t it an invention ?
You can patent the process of the gold mining , but never the gold itself .
If the gold is only won , it can be used for all of this that it could not be used for in the mountain , for example , for jewelry — it &apos;s not , it &apos;s still gold .
Now the year is 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to buy .
Our text was good , but not as good as that .
How could he develop such a deep understanding of this stuff ? In so short period of time ?
We just couldn &apos;t imagine that .
It got really exciting .
First of all , in a crucial moment of trial , the U.S. government changed the pages .
Now she was in opposition to her own patent official , and she explained to me that the case was to have looked at the judgment of the district Court , and made sure that isolated DNA is not patent .
And we lost — in a way .
The decision went two : one .
The two judges that were against us had very different reasons .
The first , Judge Lourie , invented his own new biological theory — completely wrong .
But she didn &apos;t want to shut up biotechnology industry , the third judge , Bryson , agreed for us .
Now we put precision on the Supreme Court .
And if you call the Supreme Court , you have to ask a question to answer the court .
Usually these questions have a super-long heels , like a page long and a lot of side approaches , &quot; where this ... &quot; and &quot; &quot; ... that &apos;s why .
We may have been asking the shortest question .
Four words : Are human genes patent ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think it should be called &quot; &quot; Is isolated DNA patent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want the judge to respond the same way I did when you introduced me to the case seven years ago . &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t use anything to do that .
Chris and I sat still in the hallway , and in some moments he would have stepped in to represent the most important case of his career .
Also , three representatives of the Human Genomic Project were in the room , including one of the explorers of DNA itself , James Watson , who described in his stepped out for the court of the Patent as &quot; &quot; insane . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of groups in this room and the contributions that made every day to be true , bandages about meaning .
The dispute itself was compelling .
Chris argued brilliant .
Judge Kagan was the case of isolated DNA with the emergence of a reproductive plant from the Amazon area .
Judge Roberts made it from cutting .
In one of my most beautiful moments , Judge Sotomayor announced , ( Laughter ) In leaving the room , we were very optimistic , but we would never have anticipated the result : 9 : 0 .
Some people promised it to a cheaper price than Myriad .
Some made a better test than the one that Myriad offered .
But the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
It spins an obstacle for medical discovery and innovation aside .
A few weeks after judgment , I got a little package with the mail .
It was from Bob Cook Deegan , a professor at Duke University , and one of the first people that Chris and I visited when we were wondering whether we should do the case .
I opened it up , and I found a small animal .
What gave us the courage was the confidence to do the right thing .
It moved from the beginning to the end of almost eight years , with a lot of twists .
Thank you .

The second quote comes from the chairman .
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
Then predictions can be made and tested .
What do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole thing is actually more than the sum of its parts .
Where are the economic networks ?
What we &apos;ve looked at is property networks .
And we have value to business .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies that are in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
Let me explain with this analogy .
Hello . Today I &apos;ll give you insights in eight of my projects working with the Danish artist Slisten Pors .
We call ourselves Pors &amp; Rao , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my very first object that I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle fon . &quot; &quot; It was inspired by the Marotte of my uncle to always ask me to do things for him , as if I was an extension of his body — turning on the light , or bringing a glass of water to catch a pack of cigarettes .
When I grew up , it got worse and worse , and I felt it as a kind of control .
I could never say anything , of course , because an uncle is a respectman in Indian families .
The thing that puzzled me most was his way of phone calls on the grid .
He held the listener , and he expected me to vote for him .
As an answer and as a gift to my uncle , I created &quot; &quot; The Uncle fon &quot; &quot; for him . It &apos;s so long that it has to be used by two people .
Just like my uncle used a telephone that was thought for a person .
But the problem is , when I moved home and went to college , his commands were missing me .
So I built a golden typewriter that he could type in his commands to send them to his nephews and nieces as an email .
He had to put a piece of paper , type in his email or commands and pull the paper out .
The machine would automatically send the letter to an email from the person to the person .
Here you see that we built a lot of electronics that translates all the mechanical commands into digital commands .
My uncle only uses a mechanical interface .
And also , the object had to be very large , and it had to be virtually used , as my uncle likes it .
The next work is a deceptive installation that we would love to do with &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; We wanted to convey the idea of being surrounded by a hormone very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So we have these panels on the wall , and the little creatures hide behind them .
Once it gets quiet , they get out .
If it gets harder , it &apos;s spitting its halves .
But the smallest sound , they &apos;re gone again .
We had the panels on three walls of the room .
And over 500 Pygmies hiding behind it .
And this is how it works .
This is a video of the prototype .
If it &apos;s silent , they appear .
And they hear — like humans or other real creatures .
And so soon they become immune to sound that they &apos;re frightening .
And they don &apos;t respond to backgrounds .
Right now , you hear a train they don &apos;t respond to .
( Sound of the sound ) But they respond to sound in the foreground — as you hear in a moment .
( Whistling ) We worked hard to make it as vivid as possible .
Each Pygmie has its own behavior , its own psyche , mood variation , personality and so on .
This is a very early prototype .
Later , it became better and better .
We made them respond to people , and we found that people were very playful and chilly going around with them .
This video installation is called &quot; &quot; The missing person . &quot; &quot; We were very excited to play with the idea of invisibility .
How could you develop the sense of invisibility ?
So we worked with a company that specialized on surveillance technology , and asked them to develop a software for a camera that recognizes people in the room , and replaced a person through the background , which is invisible .
I &apos;ll show you a very early prototype .
On the right you see my colleague listening , who &apos;s really in the room .
And on the left you see the processed video where the camera makes it invisible .
Listen enters the room and — Puff — he &apos;s gone .
You can see the camera is following him and wiping it out .
It &apos;s an early video , so we don &apos;t handle the overlapping and the rest of it yet , but it &apos;s soon refined .
So we used a camera that took up the room , and on every wall we had a monitor .
As soon as people walked into the room , they saw themselves in the screen — just with a difference : one person was constantly invisible , wherever she was moving in the room .
This is what we call &quot; &quot; The Sunshine . &quot; &quot; It was like a piece of paper , a cut child drawing of dirty oil or a sun .
From the front , this object worked strong and robust , but it was very weak from the side .
In the enterprise of space , people almost ignored it , and they thought it was the junk around .
But as soon as they passed it , it began to crack up the wall .
Over and over again , it broke down .
( Laughter ) This work is the cartoon of a turning person .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thought that he &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat that his body grows out of like a flower pot .
It moves around in its head in a very decent way with unpredictable , very slow motion .
It &apos;s destricted by this circle .
If the circle wasn &apos;t there on a flat floor , it would go through the room .
There are no wires .
Let me give you an example : when people enter the room , they activate the object .
Very slowly , in a few minutes , it &apos;s almost painful and then it wins pigs , and it looks like it was about to crash .
This is a very important moment , because we wanted to create a need for the viewer to help this creature save it .
It doesn &apos;t need that , because it &apos;s just pushing itself up .
This work was a technological challenge to us , and we &apos;ve been working hard for several years , to get the mechanics , the balance and the dynamics .
And it was very important for us to realize the point when it falls , because if it could overcome , it would hurt , and it wouldn &apos;t fall enough , that fatalism doesn &apos;t solve , so the need to help him .
I &apos;m going to show you a quick video now , when we stole it — it went much faster .
Here &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s leaving it .
Now he gets nervous and wants to catch it .
It doesn &apos;t have to , because it &apos;s all coming up by itself .
And we &apos;ve been very fascinated with this work to work with the aesthetics of a fur , where thousands of tiny , different optical cables are embedded like a star hall .
It has the framework of the night sky .
We wrapped it around this bladder shape of a teddy bear hanging off the ceiling .
The idea was to show something very cold , far distance and abstraction like space in the known form of a teddy bear , which is very calm and familiar .
At some point , you should stop looking at the tedyform , but you should almost perceive it as a space hole , as if you look out in the sparkly night sky .
This is the last — still inferred — work , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; space fillers . &quot; &quot; Imagine a cube about the size of you in the middle of a room , and the one you want to shy at when you approach you by getting to a cube double-height and four times the volume of volumes . &#91; Anmid 2 : 8 : 8 = 3 . &#93;
This object grows or shrinks all the time to create a dynamic around it , almost as if I try to hide it .
We &apos;ve been working with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t like technology particularly , because it &apos;s always challenged us .
But we use them because we want to figure out how to help us express emotions and behaviors from these creatures that we build .
Once a creature freezes us , almost a process of creation , where we can figure out how to live with the creature , what shape they have and how they want to move .
Thank you .

It takes all life to survive .
Could it have been right at some point in time ?
I love the Internet .
Really .
Think about all the things that it brought us .
Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the conversation , all the business , all the trade .
And it &apos;s happening now , in our lifetime .
I &apos;m pretty sure one day we will write history books , in a few hundred years , and then you will remember our generation as the generation that went online , the generation that created something truly global .
But it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , security problems and privacy issues .
I spend my career fighting these problems .
Let me show you something .
This is Brain .
This is a data chain — a 130 millimeter disk , infected with Brain.A.
It &apos;s the first virus we found for PCs .
And we also know where Brain came from .
We know it because it &apos;s in the code .
Let &apos;s take a look inside .
All right .
This is the boat sector of an infected disk , and if we take a little closer look in it , what we see here is , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dark . &quot; &quot; And then it goes on with 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
And Basit and Amjad are names , Pakistani projections .
There &apos;s even a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) So 1986 .
Now we have the year 2011 .
That was 25 years ago .
The problem of PC-viruses is now 25 years old .
A half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan .
Let &apos;s see , here are some photos I took in Pakistan .
Here you see the city of Lahore , which is about 300 miles south of Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the street or the road that leads to this building , the block 730 Nizam in Allama Iqbal Town .
And I knocked on the door .
( Laughter ) And do you want to guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they still live there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s Basit .
And behind that , his brother is Amjad .
These are the men who wrote the first PC-virus .
Of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked her why .
I asked her what they thought about what they started .
And I found it quite satisfying to find that the computer had been infected by both men over the years with dozens of times with completely different viruses .
So there &apos;s a kind of justice in the world .
Now , the viruses that we saw in the 1980s and 1990s are obviously not a problem .
Let me just show you a few examples of what they looked like .
What I &apos;m using here is a system that allows me to do old programs on a modern computer .
Let me just put a couple of treadmills here . Look over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
Let me do some viruses on my computer .
Let &apos;s look at , for example , the centipede virus .
We can see in the upper half of the screen there is a thousandfold folder running across the computer when it &apos;s infected with this virus .
You know you have a viral infection because it actually makes you realize .
Here &apos;s another one . This virus is called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one that makes a sound .
( Singing ) And the last example , guess what the forest virus does .
Right , you see a man walking across the screen when the computer is infected .
So it was very easy to see if you had a virus infection when the viruses were written by basters and teenagers .
Today , they are no longer written by basters and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
Here in the background , we see an example of our system that we use in our labs where we track viral infections around the world .
We can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
If I make a connection with our lab systems on the web , in real time we can get a sense of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every day .
Here &apos;s the latest virus we found in a file called Server.exe.
And we found him over there three seconds ago — that before six seconds ago .
And when we scroll around , it &apos;s just overwhelming .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And that &apos;s just the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
So where do these viruses come from ?
Well , today there are organized crime banks writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
It &apos;s someone like — let &apos;s call up GangstaBucks.com .
This is a website that operates in Moscow where these people buy infected computers .
So if you write viruses and you &apos;re able to infect Windows computer , but you don &apos;t know what to do with it , then you can sell these infected computers — computers from other people — to these people .
And they actually pay money for these computers .
How do these people then make money with these infected computers ?
Well , there are different ways , like banking Trojans who steal money from accounts when you use online banking or keyloger .
Keylogger would silent and quiet in the computer , hide well , and record everything you type .
So they &apos;re sitting on the computer , for example , looking for something with Google .
Every single Google search you &apos;re doing is stored and led to criminals .
Every single email you write is stored and sent to criminals .
The same with every single password and so on .
But what they &apos;re really looking for is the sessions that you go online and buy stuff in any online store .
Because when you buy stuff in online stores , you type in your name , your supply address , your credit card number and the test number of your credit card .
And here &apos;s an example of a file that we found a few weeks ago on a server .
This is the credit card number , this is the failure date , this is the card number , and this is the name of the credit card owner .
Once you have access to the credit card details of other people , you can just go online and buy what you want with that information .
And that &apos;s , obviously , a problem .
We now have a whole market and a business system underground that uses online crime .
One example of how these people can make money with their operations , and we &apos;re looking at the pages of INTERPOL , and we &apos;re testing them for healthy people .
We &apos;re hitting men like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his commute , also performed on the sides of INTERPOL , Mr. Shaileshmer Jain , a U.S. citizen .
These men ran an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercriminal surgery , where they prevent millions .
They &apos;re both on the verge right now .
Nobody knows where they are .
U.S.-officials stored a Swiss bank account a few weeks ago that Mr. Jain heard , and on this bank account , there were 14.9 million U.S. bank account .
So the wealth that online crime is remarkable .
And that means that online criminals can afford to invest in their attacks .
We know that online criminals hire programmers and people who test their code , and Back-Endinee systems with S.L. databases .
And they can afford to watch how we work — how security people work — and try to figure out a way to deal with the security benefits that we meet .
They also use the global character of the Internet to benefit .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why you call it the Internet .
And if you look at what happens in the online world , here &apos;s a video of Clarified Networks that illustrates how a single Malware family can move around the world .
This surgery that you assume that it has its origin in Estonia goes from one country to another as soon as it &apos;s tried to keep the website quiet .
So you can &apos;t stop these people .
They move from one country to another , from one court district to the next — moving around the world and using the fact that we &apos;re not able to track operations like this globally .
So through the Internet , it &apos;s as if you would have given free airtickets all over the world .
Criminals that we couldn &apos;t do earlier can now reach us .
So how do you find online criminals ?
How do you feel them ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is an exploit .
Here you see the hexdump of a file containing an exploit .
And what that means is , if you try to open this file on your Windows computer , it takes control over your computer , and it takes a code .
So if you look at this file — well , here &apos;s the Header of the image , and that &apos;s where the actual code of attack begins .
And that code was encrypted , so let &apos;s unravel it .
It would be encrypted with XOR , 97 .
You just have to believe this , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true .
And we can go here and start decoding it .
The yellow part of the code is now encrypted .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t look much different from the original .
But keep staring at it .
You &apos;ll find that you can see an Internet address down there : unionseek.com / ioo.exe , and if you open this file on your computer , that program will be downloaded and executed .
And this is the backdoor that your computer is being adopted .
But more interesting , if we continue to decode , we find this mysterious series of O600KO78RUS .
This code is under encryption as a kind of signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I looked at this , and I tried to figure out what it means .
And of course I went for it .
I got zero hits ; I didn &apos;t get it .
So I talked to people from the lab .
And we have some Russian employees in our lab , and one of them said , well , it ends up in rus like Russia .
And 78 is the urban code for St. Petersburg .
You can find it in phone numbers , for example , in phone numbers or car marks and Ahmal .
So I was looking for contact in St. Petersburg , and after a long search , we finally found this particular website .
Here &apos;s this Russian that &apos;s been online for a few years , and has its own website and leads a blog to the popular Live Journal .
And in this blog , he writes about his life , his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s beginning 20 — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a very beautiful car .
In fact , he drives a Mercedes Benz S600 V12 with a 6-liter engine and more than 400 PS .
This is a pretty fancy car for a man in the beginning of 20 who lives in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he wrote about it in his blog .
He had a car accident .
In the inner city of St. Petersburg , he drove his car into another car .
And he posted pictures of the crash in his blog — this is his Mercedes — here &apos;s the Lada Samara that he drove in .
And you can see that the number sign of the Samara ends with 78RUS .
And if you look closer at the images of the scene , you can see that the sign of the Mercedes O600KO78RU.S.
Well , I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I were , then I would say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the case closed . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What happens when online criminals are being cut ?
Well , in most cases , it &apos;s not that far .
In most of the cases of all online crime , we don &apos;t even know what continent the attacks are .
And even if we can detect online criminals , in many cases there &apos;s no outcome .
The local police don &apos;t act , or , if it does , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or we can &apos;t hold them accountable for other reasons .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it &apos;s not .
But things are also changing very rapidly .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
If you look at what Stuxnet did , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s infected these devices here .
This is a Siemens S7-400 PLC , a programmable logical controller .
And that &apos;s what controls our infrastructure .
That &apos;s what &apos;s controlling all around us .
PLCs , these little devices that have no display , no keyboard that are programmed , are set up and do their job .
For example , the elevators in this building are highly likely to be controlled by one of these devices .
And when Stuxnet infects one of them , there &apos;s a tremendous revolution in terms of the kinds of threats that we have to worry about .
Because all around us is controlled by these devices .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Go to a factory , a power plant , any chemical plant , any food factory , and look around — everything we control of these devices .
Everything we &apos;re doing with computers .
Everything depends on how these computers work .
We are now very dependent on the Internet , from fundamental things like electricity , of course , from working computers .
And this is really something that gives us a whole new problem .
We have to find some way to make sure that everything is going on , even though the computer is falling out .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Ready means that we can also do things if the things we take for granted are not available .
And there are very basic things underlying this — considerations of continuity , Back-Ups , in terms of things that are really important .
Well , I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . Really .
Think about the services that are available to us online .
Think about what happens when you get taken away , if you don &apos;t have them one day for some reason .
I see it beautiful in the future of the Internet , but I worry that maybe we won &apos;t get it face .
I &apos;m worried we &apos;re going to have problems because of online crime .
Online crime is the only thing that might take us away from these things .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my whole life defending the web , and I think if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we &apos;re at risk of losing everything .
We need to do this globally , and we need to do it now .
What we need is more global , international collaboration in crime fighting to find people out of online crime — these organized individuals who earn millions with their attacks .
This is much more important than using anti-viral programs and firewalls .
What &apos;s really important is to find the people who are behind these attacks , and more importantly , we find the people who are about to become part of this world of online crimes that are not yet .
We need to find the people who have the skills , but not the opportunities , and allow them to use their faiths for the good .
Thank you very much .

The world is changing at a remarkable pace .
If you look at the graph up here , in 2025 , according to this Goldman Prognosis , the Chinese economy will be almost as big as the American economy .
And if you look at the graph by 2050 , it predicts that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will have almost the same size as the American economy .
And we should keep in mind that these predictions were regulated before the economic crisis in the West .
A few weeks ago , I looked at the latest predictions of BNP Paribas to the question of when China is going to have a bigger economy than the United States .
Goldman Sachs predicts 2027 .
The news prediction is 2020 .
This is in just a decade .
China is going to change the world in terms of two fundamental aspects .
First of all , it &apos;s a huge development country with a population of 1.3 billion people that have been growing for over 30 years with a rate of about 10 percent a year .
And within a decade , the country will have the largest economy in the world .
Never before in modernism , the largest economy in the world was a developing country rather than an industrial continent .
Secondly , and for the first time in modernism , the dominant country in the world — what I think China will be — will not be from the West and with very , very different civilizational roots .
Now I know it &apos;s a very common assumption in the West , that countries that modernize are also Western .
This is an illusion .
It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is just a product of competition , markets and technology .
It &apos;s not ; it &apos;s also determined by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will never be like the West .
It will remain very different in fundamental aspects .
Now , the big question here is obvious : How can we understand China ?
How can we try to understand what China is ?
And the problem that we have in the West right now is that the conventional approach is that we really look at it in Western conditions using Western ideas .
We can &apos;t .
Now I want to offer you this : three blocks to try to understand how China is — just as a launch .
The first is that China is not really a nation-state .
Okay , it referred to itself as a nation-state in the last hundred years , but anyone who knows anything about China knows that the country is much older .
This is what China looked like in the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. , at the end of the time of arguing empires — the birth of modern China .
And you can compare it to the limits of modern China .
Or right after that , the Han Dynasia , still 2,000 years ago .
And you can see , it extends beyond what we now call East china , the area where most Chinese lived and lives today .
Now , what &apos;s so extraordinary about this is that what China has its understanding of being China , what Chinese has given their understanding of what it means to be Chinese , not in the last hundred years , not in the time of the nation-state , so what has happened in the West , but from a time you like , of civilizations state .
For example , I think of practices like ancestry , in a very own term of state , as well as a very own notion of family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
These are all values that come from the time of civilizations .
In other words , China , unlike Western states and most other countries around the world , is shaped by its understanding of civilization , its existence as a civilizational state , and not as a nation-state .
And there &apos;s one other thing to add , and this is this : of course , we know China is big , huge , demographic and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we &apos;re often not really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
You can &apos;t just control a country of this size from Beijing , even though we often think that &apos;s the case .
It never happened .
So this is China , a civilizational state , not so much a nation-state .
And what does that mean ?
Well , I think it has all sorts of elementary implications .
I &apos;ll give you two close examples .
The first is that the largest political value for Chinese unit is the truth of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : collapse , the fragmentation of the sacred Roman Empire .
It divided , and it &apos;s been divided since then .
China , at the same time , went exactly the opposite direction , under great pain , held this great civilization , the Civilization state together .
The second one is perhaps a little sober , and this is Hong Kong .
Remember the return of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese proposed as a constitution .
A country , two systems .
And I bet hardly anyone in the West believed them .
&quot; Eyewitness . &quot;
If China has Hong Kong , we won &apos;t vote anymore . &quot; &quot; 13 years later , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different as it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , of course , in the sense of a nation-state .
Think about the German immigration , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the east was swallowed off the west .
A nation , a system .
This is the mentality of the nation-state .
But you can &apos;t have a country like China , a civilizational state , based on civilization , a system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
In fact , China &apos;s answer to the question of Hong Kong — just as it will be to the question of Taiwan — a natural answer : a civilization , many systems .
Let me introduce another building block to try to understand China — maybe a little less comfortable .
The Chinese have a very , very different notion of ethnie than most other countries .
You know , from the 1.3 billion Chinese people think about 90 percent that they belong to the same ethnic , the Han .
Now , this is completely different from the other highly populated countries in the world .
India , the United States — Indonesia , Brazil — all are multi-ethnic .
The Chinese see this differently .
China is multi-ethnically only on the edges .
So the question is , why ?
Well , I think the reason for this basically leads , again , back to the civilizations state .
A story of at least 2,000 years , a story of epiphany , occupation , aspiration , etc . , led to the development , through the period of time , the idea of han emerged — of course , through a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
Now , the great advantage of this historic experience is that without the Han China , you could never have survived .
The Han identity is the cement that the country has held together .
The great disadvantage of this is that Han has a very small idea of cultural differences .
They really believe in their own bias , and they &apos;re very respectless to those who are not Han .
So for example , their behavior against the utilities and the Tibetans .
Or let me introduce you to my third building block , the Chinese state .
So , the relationship between the state and the society in China is very different from the West .
In the West , we seem overwhelmingly thinking — in any case today — that authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
The problem with this assumption is that the Chinese state is experiencing more legitimacy and more authority among the Chinese than it would be in some Western state .
And the reason is that — well , I think there are two reasons .
And that , of course , has nothing to do with democracy , because after our imagination , the Chinese have no democracy .
And the reason for that is , first of all , the state in China gets a very special — enjoy a very special value as the representative , the embodiment and the hillside of the Chinese civilization , the civilizations state .
This is as close as China has a kind of spiritual role .
And the second reason is that , in Europe and North America , the power of the state is constantly questioned — I mean , in the European tradition , in the history of church , against other areas of Aristocracy , against hackers and so on — for a thousand years , the power of the Chinese state has not been asked .
He had no severe rivals .
So you can see that the way power was built in China is very different than our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that Chinese have a very different picture of the state .
As we tend to think of it as an inventor , a stranger , certainly an organ that has to be limited or defined or limited , Chinese don &apos;t see the state at all .
The Chinese see the state as a trust — actually not only as a trust , as a member of the family — not only as a member of the family , but as the leader of the family , the patriarch of the family .
This is the Chinese idea from the state — very , very different from ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society differently compared to the way it is in the West .
And I would suggest to you that what we actually have here to do , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm that is different than anything we had to think about in the past .
Be aware that China believes in the market and the state .
I mean , Adam Smith , who wrote in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is bigger and more developed and novelous than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , besides the Mao period , that stayed more or less the case until today .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
I mean , he &apos;s leading companies , which many of us are state ownership .
Private companies , no matter how big they are , like Lenovo , depend on many kinds of state rule .
Economic goals and so on are determined by the state .
And the state , of course , affects its authority many other areas — as we know it — like one-child politics .
On top of that , it &apos;s a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of prosperity .
I mean , if you want a representation , the Chinese wall is one .
But this is another one , this is the Kisseal , which first started in the fifth century before Christ .
And finally , it was finished in the seventh century after Christ .
He was in 1972 miles , connected Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long story of extraordinary government infrastructure projects in China , which helps us explain what we see today , which is something like the three Gorges Dam and many other aspects of state competence in China .
So here we have three building blocks to try to understand the other thing China is — the Civilization state , the concept of ethnicity , and the kind of state and its relationship to society .
And yet , we &apos;re all composed of thinking , we can understand China by simply hanging on Western experiences , looking at Western eyes , using Western concepts .
If you want to know why we don &apos;t inevitably understand China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen in China are wrong — that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I think I have to say that I think the attitude to China is one of the smallest Western mentality .
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think we are the best , and that &apos;s why we have the universal scale .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
We reject it to really address the issue of differences .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen argues that the West sees itself as the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the provincial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant that it was not really necessary to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because in the end , he can , notwithstanding violence , his will .
Behind those cultures — literally the rest of the world — who were in a much slower position , vis-a-vis of the West , were forced to understand the West because of the presence of the West in those societies .
And so they are , as a result , in many ways , cosmopolitic than the West .
I mean , look at the question of East Asia .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Today , the largest economy in the world .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , the East Asians , people from East Asia know much more about the West than the West over East Asia .
Now this aspect is very relevant , I &apos;m afraid , for the present .
Because what happens ? Back to the chart from the beginning — the Goldman Sachs graph .
What happens is that , for historical terms , the world is very rapidly driven and formed , not by the old developed world , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 — which is the position of the G7 quickly — or the G8 .
And that has two consequences .
First , the West is rapidly losing its impact .
By the way , one year ago , there was a dramatic example — Copenhagen , climate conference .
Europe didn &apos;t sit with the final negotiation table .
When did that last happen ?
I would guess it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what will happen in the future .
And the second consequence is that the world is inevitable as a consequence of us becoming increasingly unfamiliar , because it &apos;s shaped by cultures and experiences and history that we &apos;re not really familiar or familiar .
And finally , I fear — take Europe , America is a little bit different — but Europeans , I have to say , largely ignorant , and not consciously about how the world is changing .
Some people — I have a English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is going to get eaten . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe it &apos;s a hyperbole .
But there &apos;s another problem associated with this — that Europe is increasingly beginning to connect the world — and that &apos;s kind of a loss of an idea of the future .
I mean , Europe once has , of course , once the future has been missing in its solid conviction .
Take , for example , the 19th century .
But fortunately , this is no longer true .
If you want to feel the future , if you want to try the future , try China — this is the old Confucius .
This is a station station , as you &apos;ve never seen one before .
He doesn &apos;t even look like a railroad station .
This is the new station in Guangzhou for high-speed elevators .
China now has a bigger grid than any other country in the world , and pretty soon it will have a bigger than all other countries combined .
Or this : Now it &apos;s an idea , but this idea is soon tried in a suburb of Beijing .
Here you have a Megabus , at the top level , are transported around 2,000 people .
He &apos;s driving down a road in suburbia on railroads , and the cars are driving below .
And it &apos;s speeding up to over 200 miles an hour .
So that &apos;s how things will evolve because China has a very specific problem that is different from Europe and the United States , China has a high population and no place .
So this is a solution to a situation where China will have many , many , many cities with more than 20 million people .
Okay , so how do I want to close ?
Now , how should our attitude be about this world that we see , how it &apos;s evolving very rapidly in front of our eyes ?
I think it &apos;s going to have good aspects , and it &apos;s going to have bad aspects .
But I want to leave you with a bigger picture , which is positive for this world .
For 200 years , the world was essentially registered by a fraction of the world &apos;s population .
This is what Europe and North America represented .
The emergence of countries like China and India — the 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represents the greatest act of democratization over the last 200 years .
Civilizations and cultures that were ignored that had no linguistic word that was not listened to , that were unknown , will be replicated differently in the world .
As a humanist , we certainly need to embrace this transformation , and we &apos;re going to need to learn about these civilizations .
This great ship here was that , with the Zheng Jews in the early 15th century , sailed on its great travel across the South China Sea , the East China Sea , and from the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
The little boat before that is that , with 80 years later , Christoph Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silence of Zhu Zhou from 1368 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
My God , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
But before you tweak your rifle , or start singing , or choosing your favorite color , I want to define revolution .
Revolution , I think , is a radical and transnational change in thinking and behavior — how we think and how we behave .
But why , Steve , do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because the situation is so bad here . Very bad .
And that makes me really sad because I have the nose full of the bad situation here .
I have the nose full of us not using our whole potential .
I &apos;ve filled the nose that we &apos;re always on the last place .
And it &apos;s in the last place in many areas — for example , social conditions .
We are in the last place in Europe in the realm of innovation .
We &apos;re at the end of the table , in the last place as the culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
Our health care system is in the last place , and that &apos;s important for well-being .
It &apos;s not just in E.U. , but in all of Europe — in the last place .
But the bad news is what the Economist magazine reported three weeks ago , as you might have read .
We are the saddest nation in the world , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest country in the world .
This is in the social sector , let &apos;s look at education now .
What place are we , three weeks ago , after another OECD report ?
In the last place in reading , math and science , last place .
The corporate area : the lowest revelation in E.U.
that entrepreneurs in society are making benefits .
Why did that happen , and what happened ?
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs launching a business .
And that &apos;s also , if everybody knows that small companies are the engine of the economy .
We have most employees , we produce most of the fees .
And when our engine is broken , what are the implications ?
On the last place in Europe , GDP per capita .
Last .
So it &apos;s not surprising that only 62 percent of the Bulgarians are optimistic for the future .
We &apos;re sad , we have bad education , and we have the weakest companies .
And these are the facts .
This is not a fairy tale , I &apos;m not phanizing .
No .
It &apos;s not a conspiracy against Bulgaria . These are the facts .
So I think it &apos;s very clear that our system is broken .
As we think and behave , our behavior system is broken .
We need a transnational change in thinking and behavior to turn bularios into something better for us and for our friends , for our family and our future .
How did that happen ?
Let &apos;s be optimistic now . We &apos;re going to be optimistic . How did that happen ?
I think we &apos;re in the last place , because — and this is going to be uncomfortable for some of you — because we keep ourselves from ourselves .
We keep ourselves because we don &apos;t have a pleasure to play .
I said play .
If any of you can &apos;t remember what play is , that &apos;s play .
Babies play , children play , play adults .
We don &apos;t value play .
In fact , we &apos;re going to play .
And we &apos;re going to take it down into three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to these areas in history .
Social : 45 years of what ?
Communism — of society and state , pay more attention than the individual and squeeze , regardless , creativity , the individual expression and the innovation .
And instead , what are we going to put value on ?
It &apos;s known that the way we use knowledge , generate and use knowledge , is affected by our social and institutional contexts that taught us about communism ?
Seriously .
Really , to be serious .
That &apos;s what happened .
( Applause ) Be serious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been vaccinated because I let my kids play on the ground .
God forbid that I let my kids play in the mud , or even in puddle , water , that will kill them .
I &apos;ve been advised by grandmothers and grandparents that kids shouldn &apos;t play so much because life is serious , and they &apos;re supposed to be bothered that life is serious .
We have a continuous meme — to be serious .
This is a gene of society .
This is a serious gene .
It &apos;s existed for 45 years , and it &apos;s caused the emergence of the grandmother factor . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And that &apos;s how it works .
Step one : One woman says , &quot; &quot; I want a baby . I want a baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : We get a baby . Woohoo !
But what will happen in step three ?
I want to work again because I want to promote my killer or just drink coffee .
I &apos;m leaving my baby at the grandmother .
But we have to remember that grandmother has been infected with the serious gene for 45 years .
What &apos;s going to happen ?
It passes the virus on to the baby , and it goes very , very , very much time — like the sequence — to remove this serious meme from our system .
What will happen then ?
It infects our educational system that has also been obsolete and has not been changed for 100 years , and estimates the elementary glasses and standardization , and value self-expression and self-exploration , arousal , creativity and play .
This system is broken .
A real story : I was looking for a school for my child .
We went to a renovated little school , and then we said , kids will learn math 10 times a week , and science eight times a week and read five times a week and so on .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , but how about play and schooling ? &quot; &quot; And then we said , &quot; &quot; Ha . Not only a moment will they have that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s only five years old . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
And it &apos;s a crime that our educational system is so serious , because education is so serious that we produce hirless seals , robotically engineered labor will turn the olves into pre-boiled holes .
But forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
We need adaptability to learn the ability to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need a mechanical human labor force .
But now our memes are working where we don &apos;t value play .
We produce robotically engineered human labor that we treat as activa that we breathe and we throw away .
How do you describe the work in Bulgaria ?
Autocratic — Make what I say because I &apos;m the boss .
I &apos;m the boss , and I know I &apos;m better than you .
Misstraugic — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I installed surveillance cameras .
( Laughter ) Immediately — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so for you , I do a lot of little processes that you have to follow and not shout .
So they &apos;re constraints — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t use your Internet , don &apos;t be on the I.M.
It &apos;s kind of unprofessional and bad .
And at the end of the day , there &apos;s no fulfillment , because you &apos;re intended , limited and unreviewed , and it &apos;s not fun .
In society , in education and in our business , we don &apos;t value play .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re in the last place , because we don &apos;t appreciate play .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s nonsense , Steve . A stupid idea .
It can &apos;t be , just because of the game .
Just play is a stupidity . &quot; &quot; We have this serendious meme inside of us .
I &apos;m not going to say no .
And I &apos;m going to prove this to you in the following part of this talk — that play is the catalyst , the revolution , and we can use it to transform Bulgaria into the better .
Play : Our brains are programmed to play .
Evolution selected it , millions and cheaper years before , for animals and humans .
And you know what ?
Evolution makes it very , very good , in the defense of properties that are not participatory to us , and in the choice of properties that are powerful and imaginative .
Nature is not stupid and selected play .
Everywhere in the animal world , for example , ants , are playing ants .
Maybe you didn &apos;t know .
But when they play , they learn the rules of society and the dynamics of things .
Rats play , but you might not know that rats that played more have larger brains , and they learn better tasks than skills .
We all know that kittens play .
But what they may not know is that kittens that haven &apos;t played are socially weak .
They can chase , but they don &apos;t have social skills .
Bars are playing .
But what you may not know is that bears that played more live longer .
Not the bears that learned to fish better .
The bears that played more .
And the last investigation that was published shows a correlation between play and the size of the brain .
The more you play , the bigger your brain is .
Delphins that have very large brains play a lot .
But who do you think is the biggest player with the largest brain ?
Yes , exactly , the people .
Children play , we play — people of all nationalities , all races , all colors , all religions .
It &apos;s a universal thing — we &apos;re playing .
And not only the children , but also the adults .
A very good term : Neoteny — the delivery of play and juvenile attributes in adults .
And who are the largest neoteniests ?
People . We play sports .
We &apos;re playing for fun or as Olympics , or as a professional athlete .
We play music instruments .
We dance , kissing , sing , we cheat .
We are programmed by nature to play when we were born to high age .
We &apos;re programmed to do this all the time — play and play a lot and not stop playing .
That &apos;s a big advantage .
As well as there &apos;s advantage for the animals , there &apos;s advantage for the people .
For example , it &apos;s known that play stimulates the growth in the Amygdala in the part where emotion is controlled .
It &apos;s known to play in prefrontal cortex promotes development where a lot of cognition is created .
And what &apos;s the result ?
We develop more emotional rides if we play more .
We develop better decision-making if we play more .
These are the facts .
This is not fiction , no fairy tale , no fantasy ; it &apos;s insensitive , sharp science .
There are benefits in play .
It &apos;s a genetic birth law that belongs to us , just like running or speaking or seeing .
And if we disengage ourselves with play , we dispose to ourselves as if we discharge any other birth law we have .
We &apos;re holding back .
A little job only for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine the world without play .
Imagine , the world without theater , without art , without songs , without dancing , without football , without football , without laughter .
What will this world look like ?
It &apos;s very dry .
It &apos;s very expressed .
Now imagine their workplace .
Is it fun in your workplace , playful ?
Or maybe the workplace from your friends — we think forward .
Is it funny , playful there ?
Or isn &apos;t it ? Is it autocratic , supervisionary , constraints and suspicious and unfulfilling ?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
We even feel guilty when you see us playing in the workplace .
&quot; Oh , my colleagues are laughing at me . Obviously I don &apos;t have enough work to do , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m supposed to hide because my boss could see me .
He will suspect I don &apos;t work hard . &quot; &quot; But I have a message for you : your thinking is backwards .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play .
Depression , is depression .
In fact , play improves our work .
Just as there are benefits for people and animals , there are benefits to work .
For example , it stimulates creativity .
It enhances our courage to change .
It reinforces our ability to learn .
And it gives us a sense of purpose and mastery — two essential motivating things that stronger our capacity through play .
But before you think play is not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean something more satisfying .
You know , the professional athlete who likes ski is serious about it , but he likes it .
He finds it funny , he feels fantastic , he makes everything perfect .
A doctor can be serious , but laughter is a great medicine .
Our thinking is backwards .
We &apos;re not supposed to feel valid .
We should celebrate play .
Let me give you a quick example of the corporate world .
FedEx , simple motto : people , services , profit .
If you treat your employees like people , great treatments , they &apos;re happier , they have fulfillment , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
And then what will happen ? They will give better services — not worse , but better .
And when the customers call up services and talk to happy employees who can make decisions and have the fulfillment , how will the customers feel ? They will feel happy .
And what will the happy customers do that feel very happy ?
You &apos;re going to buy more of your services , and they &apos;re going to share more of their friends , and that means a greater profit .
People , services , profit .
Play increases performance , it doesn &apos;t determine it .
And you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Man , that works for FedEx in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
No chance . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It works in Bulgaria as well . Two reasons .
First , play is universal .
There &apos;s nothing special about the Bulgarians that keeps them from playing , besides the serious memes that we should throw out .
Second , I tried it . I tried it in the company Scientific .
When I started working in this company , there were no satisfied customers .
No client wanted to recommend us .
I asked all the clients .
We had a minimum profit . I also had .
We had a minimum profit , and unsatisfied steel holders .
Through a profound change , change , like transparency , change , like self-control , and collaboration , and collaboration , and not autocracy , these things are focused on results .
It doesn &apos;t matter when you get home in the morning . It doesn &apos;t matter when you go home .
It &apos;s important to me that your customer and your group are happy , and you &apos;re organized for that .
Why should I care if you came at nine o &apos;clock ?
Basically , to foster fun .
Through promoting fun and fun environment , we were able to transform science , and it &apos;s only after three short years — it sounds like a very long time , but the change is slow — every customer , not to all of us , recommend more gain than the average profit in our industry , and satisfied stains .
But you can say , &quot; &quot; How can you say they &apos;re satisfied ? &quot; &quot; We won every year , and they &apos;ve been hired on the list of the best small employer .
Independents from anonymous employers in requests .
So , it works , and it can work here in Bulgaria .
Nothing holds us back , except for our own mentality of play .
Some steps that we can do — at the end — to create this revolution through play .
First , you should believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , you go home and think about it for a while or something else .
Second , if you don &apos;t have a sense of play , then you should rediscover play .
Whatever you &apos;ve enjoyed as a child that you &apos;ve also enjoyed before six months , but now you &apos;ve been able to climb it , not enjoy it , because you feel that you should be serious , rediscover it .
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bike , or reading a book , or playing a game .
You rediscover it . Because you are the leaders who are innovation leaders who are masters of ideas .
You &apos;re those who are supposed to go back to your service or talk to your friends , and start the fire to change in the game revolution .
You should do that because if you don &apos;t feel that , your colleagues , employees won &apos;t feel it either .
They should go back and say , &quot; &quot; Listen , I &apos;ll trust you . &quot; &quot; A strange concept . I asked you . I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empowered you . I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level of my company , not just the highest .
I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
Because just the challenge is the only way that things are always made , the only way for us to get rid of the old trunk and find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as a leader .
We will defeat fear .
Fear is the enemy of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminating constraints .
You know what , let them use their cell phones for private conversations — God asleep .
Let them browse on the Internet .
Let &apos;s be in the Chat .
Let &apos;s have lunch for a long time .
lunch is like vacation from work .
It &apos;s time when you go out into the world , and download your brain , meet friends , drink a beer , eat something , talk , and then you get synergy of ideas you never had before .
Let them do that . Give them a little bit of freedom , and the most important thing is , let them play . Let them have fun at the job .
We spend a lot of time in our lives at the workplace , and the job is to be what ? A sad playground ? After 20 years , you &apos;re going to wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this all ?
Is it all and nothing more ? &quot; &quot; Not acceptable . Nepriemliv .
( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a profound change in our thinking and behavior , but we don &apos;t need a revolution of employees .
We don &apos;t need a revolution of employees .
What we need is an emergency of the players , and what we need is an emergency of the players , and what we need is an emergency of the players .
But seriously , we should be together . Today , the beginning of the emergency is going to happen , but what you &apos;re supposed to do is design the fire of the revolution , and you &apos;re supposed to share your ideas and success stories .
What works and our lives , our schools , and our work has revived through play , how play promotes a sense of promise and self-actualization ; how play promotes innovation and productivity ; and finally how play makes sense .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We should do it together , and if we do that , and share the ideas of play , we can transform Bulgaria into something better .
Thank you .

I &apos;d like to start by giving you a free one , and for that , you just have to do the following : change your body posture for two minutes .
But before I go on , I want to ask you to check your body for a second and think about how you use it .
How many of you make yourself smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we reach out . ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to be aware of what you &apos;re doing right now .
We are very fascinated by our body language , and particularly by our bodies .
You know , we &apos;re interested in — ( Laughter ) — an awkward touch or a smile or a lingy look , or maybe a rather inappropriate woodpecker , or maybe even something like a hanging chill .
Narrator : Now , they come to Number 10 , and look at this .
Even at the BBC and the New York Times .
So if we think about nonverbal behavior or body language , what social scientists call , it &apos;s about language . So we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
There are a lot of reasons to look at this .
We fall apart from pause judgments and recurrence due to body language .
These judgments can affect decisive life situations , whether we hire or encourage , or who we talk to , for a date .
Nalini Ambady , a scientist at Tufts University , for example , showed that if people spend 30 seconds looking at a video clip without clay about real doctor &apos;s interactions , their judgment on the kindness of the doctor before they &apos;re chasing or not .
If they &apos;re not deployed , that &apos;s a bad idea . Right ?
We are influenced by our own non-verbal actions , our thoughts , our feelings and our physiology .
What are the non-verbal actions I &apos;m talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study biases , and I teach at a competitive business school competition , so it was inevitable that I started to be interested in power negotiations .
I was particularly interested in the non-verbal expressions of power and dominance .
What are these non-verbal expressions of power and dominance ?
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s about growing and growing .
You make it big , stretch , you take space , you open up .
It &apos;s all about opening up .
This phrase , also known as pride , was studied by Jessica Tracy . It showed up .
We &apos;re small . We don &apos;t want to touch with the person next to us .
That &apos;s what happens when you have a lot of power .
When we meet someone with a lot of power , we make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t reflect their behavior .
I notice this behavior in education , and what do I find ? I notice that MBA students .
When they sit down , they stretch out .
Other people in their present literally fall together when they enter the room , and you see it as soon as they come in .
I &apos;ve come up with a couple of things .
Women act much more often than men .
Women are always feeling less powerful than men , so that &apos;s not surprising , but I also noticed .
This is very important in terms of MBA lessons , because involvement in class is half a note .
In Business Schools , this sex differences is a problem .
So I thought about it . You meet these people and you see them .
There is evidence for this .
We laugh , for example , if we &apos;re happy , but even if we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen so much between the teeth , it makes us happy .
So it &apos;s in both directions . In terms of power .
The second question was , if we know that our consciousness influences our bodies , can our bodies also change our consciousness ?
If I say in the context of power , what do I mean ?
What does the mind of a power human being look like ?
People with power tend to be no surprise to be more self-confident and optimistic .
Even when they &apos;re lucky , they think they can win .
There are many differences . They take more risks .
Power is also about how to respond to stress .
So you want the dominant leader with a lot of power , high test level , but without stress resistance ?
Probably not , right ? You want the person .
So we have evidence that the body can influence consciousness , at least in the facial region , and for the same thing to be achieved by a wheelchair change .
What happens in a role-change , what happens when it happens at the very smallest level ? How the following little manipulation , that tiny intersection ?
Here are some more .
So you can stand or sit .
Here are the middle-powered poses .
You fall together , you make yourself small .
When you touch your neck .
So this is happening . They enter the room .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s how the whole experiment goes .
Here are our results for testosterone .
Again , these changes happened within two minutes .
In terms of Cortisol , we &apos;re seeing this : people with a lot of power .
It seems that our non-verbal actions are influencing us in it , so it &apos;s not just the others , but we are also ourselves .
Our body changes our consciousness .
So we think it &apos;s important in situations like social situations that cause discomfort in which you &apos;re judged .
This is not about you talking to other people like this .
It &apos;s about how you talk to yourself . What do you do ?
That &apos;s what we wanted to check . Okay ?
It takes five minutes and it &apos;s recorded .
Five minutes of nothing . That &apos;s worse than being taken into the trajectory .
People hate this . Marianne LaFrance calls this .
And then four programmers look at the records .
You don &apos;t know the hypothesis . You don &apos;t know the conditions .
It &apos;s about the presence they put on the day .
These things . People sort of show their true me .
That impacts the outcome or mediates it .
So I suggested , I &apos;m going to check until you get it ! No , that &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to achieve something and then feel like a cheater .
I don &apos;t want to be a Hostapler .
When I was 19 , I had a very heavy car accident .
I was blown out of the car , and I referred several times .
I was blown out of the car . I woke up with a head injury .
I knew my I.Q. , because intelligence was important to me , and I had been charged as a child .
So I wasn &apos;t in college anymore , I tried to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to get your degree .
It &apos;s like a gear .
You &apos;re going to stay and do this .
I just internalized it . I really do . &quot; &quot; And I did . Five years of graduate school .
I don &apos;t feel like that anymore , but she did , and I could recommend that .
She can fake it , and she can become it .
So it &apos;s changed .
So I want to tell you , don &apos;t do it until you do it .
You fake it until you get it . You know ?
Keep going until you actually turned it and internalize it .
I want to close with the following .
Little modifications can lead to big changes .
That &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
You should do that . Open your brain to it .
Shortly at your testosterone level . Pink your Cortisolo level .
Don &apos;t go with a sense that you couldn &apos;t show who you really are .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Big affolding power . In hard times , we need great power .
Reach . Great power is amazing , absurd , rational , irrational , irrational .
Great affection can spread tolerance and apply to freedom to make education seem a brilliant idea .
( Laughter ) Big affolding power can throw a lights on men , or show that a lack of no one should be .
Big affection can make politicians choose , or parties unelectable .
It can make war look like a tragedy or a farce .
It &apos;s the mimic that prints headwords to our t-shirt and gets rid of our lips .
She &apos;s the foster finder who gives us the simple road through an incompetent moral thickness .
Science is smart , but big power is a little less familiar , but it &apos;s a little bit more fuzzy . And what we need now is magic .
These are seasons .
Our climate changes fast , too fast .
And the power of creation is needed to do what it does so well : to stack ourselves differently , to think dramatically .
We need to incentivize ourselves to behave differently with rich creative engagement .
And this is a piece of replacement from an initiative where I &apos;m going to bring people to be creative , to become more green .
Video : Man : Oh , you know , I &apos;m not going to drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
Narrator : So he went to his foot , and as he walked , he saw things .
Strange and wonderful things he otherwise wouldn &apos;t have seen .
A deer with a jet leg . It &apos;s a flying motorcycle .
Father and daughter separated from a mysterious wall of a bicycle .
And then he stopped . He went in front of him .
The woman that he had been traveling through the field as a child and had broken his heart .
Sure , she was a little older now .
Yes , actually , a lot older .
But he felt his old passion for her to come back .
&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he said soft . That was her name .
&quot; &quot; Tell nothing more , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , because that was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a trailer , just 300 yards from here .
Let &apos;s go and make love . It &apos;s on the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford moved out . She scraped a leg , and then the other one .
Gusty dumped into her and made rythmic love with her while she was filming him because she was a dedicated amateur pornographer .
The Earth was moving both .
And they lived together forever .
And that &apos;s just because he went to his foot that day .
( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We have the science , we had the contest .
The moral commandment is on the table .
Big affolding is required to implement everything , simple and scream .
To connect , let people want to make action .
So this is a call , an app , to the most inexquisitely talented TED community .
Let &apos;s face climate change creatively .
And that &apos;s quick . Thank you .
( Applause )
Beau Lotto : So , the game is very simple .
You just have to read what you see . All right ?
I count for you , then we don &apos;t have to make it all together .
One , two , three . Audience : Could you read that ?
BL : Amazing . What about it ? One , two , three . Audience : You don &apos;t read that .
BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) Maybe as Portuguese . And that ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
BL : What are you reading ? There are no words .
I said , read what you see , right ?
In fact , it says , &quot; &quot; Wa , i r ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
I should have told you , right ? How is that ?
Because perception is based on our experience .
The brain takes meaningless information and makes it understand what it means that we never see what &apos;s there . We never see the information , just what makes sense in the past .
That means that in our perceptions , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s about getting information . It &apos;s generating useful behavior . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Boy , ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : If it doesn &apos;t work the way we like it , we &apos;d like it , right ?
But I &apos;m talking about perception here .
And the perception underpins everything we think , our hopes , our dreams , our clothing , everything starts with perception .
When perception is based on our history , that means we &apos;re just reacting to something we &apos;ve done before .
But this creates a huge problem , because how do we ever see something different ?
I want to tell you a story about the &quot; &quot; different , &quot; &quot; and every new perception starts the same .
She starts with a question .
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
Uncertainty is a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure this is an enemy , it &apos;s too late !
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even sea disease is based on uncertainty .
Under Deck , you &apos;re telling you the inside , you &apos;re moving , but the eyes are moving in the entrance with the boat and saying , &quot; I &apos;m standing still . &quot;
The brain cannot process uncertainty and gets sick .
The question is , why is it very dangerous because it makes you insecure .
The irony is that we can only do something new if we &apos;re going to take that step .
How can we ever do something new ? Fortunately , evolution has the answer for us .
It enables us to ask the most difficult questions , the best questions are the ones that make the biggest uncertainty .
It &apos;s those that challenge our truth .
It &apos;s easy to ask for the origin of life , or the limits of the universe , but to question what you believe is really what makes you enter the Neuland .
So what is the answer of evolution to the problem of uncertainty ?
Play !
Play is not just a process . Experts in games will say it &apos;s more like a question of being .
Only in games , the uncertainty is celebrated . The uncertainty is the fun of play .
It adds to change . It opens up opportunities and it &apos;s cooperative , so we create social contacts , and it &apos;s self-motivating , which means that we play to play , and the game is self-rewarding .
If you look at these five lifestyles , it &apos;s exactly the one you need to be a good scientist .
Science is not a cut on a sheet of paper .
It &apos;s a question of perspective , this one , and it &apos;s all creative .
You add game rules , you have a game .
This is how an experiment works .
So with these two ideas , that science is a view and experiments , we asked , can any scientist become ?
Who could you ask better than 25 to 10 year-old children ?
These are the experts in the game . I took my hives with a little school in department , with the goal to let kids see science with other eyes , but also see themselves through science .
First of all , they should ask a question .
We didn &apos;t get money for this study , because scientists said that small kids can &apos;t afford a meaningful contribution to science , and the same thing the teachers said .
Of course we did .
Here &apos;s just a few of these questions . Small printed , so you &apos;re not trying to read it . The point is that five of these questions were the basis of any scientific publication of the last five to 15 years .
So they asked the right questions for scientists .
I want to share the stage with someone very special .
She was one of the young people who participated in the study , and now she &apos;s one of the most recent scientists in the world , and when she comes to the stage , she &apos;s also the youngest person ever spoke at TED .
It takes courage for science and questions .
She &apos;s the personalization of courage because she &apos;s going to talk to you here .
Amy , do you come up please ? ( Applause ) Amy helps me tell the story of &quot; &quot; Blackawton bee . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;s going to start with the question they came up with . Fang on , Amy .
Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought it would be easy to see a connection of people and monkeys because we see ourselves similar .
So we wondered if there &apos;s a connection to other animals , and it would be fascinating if people and bees were similar , even though they seem so different from us .
So we asked , did people and bees solve complex problems ?
We wanted to know if bees were similar to adaptive new situations and before adapted rules and conditions , what if bees think like us ?
That would be fascinating . We &apos;re talking about an insect with just a million brain cells .
But in fact , it makes a lot of sense . Bees recognize , just like us , a good flower , regardless of daytime , the light , the weather , or the anesthesia . ( Applause ) BL : The next step was going to be designed an experiment that &apos;s a game . The children moved on and designed the experiment or play . Amy , what was this game for a game ? How did the bees solve ?
AO : The puzzle was a Wenn-Danny rule .
The bees should not only fly to a particular color , but to a particular colored flower with a particular pattern .
They were rewarded when they flew to the yellow flowers when the yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or when the blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
The bees can learn a few different rules to solve the puzzle , and the interesting question is , what ?
What was exciting about this project was that neither Beau nor we knew whether it was going to work .
It was something completely new . No one had ever done it before , even the adults didn &apos;t . ( Laughter ) BL : That was hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to not know what he &apos;s doing , nothing else we do in the lab , but a teacher is struggling to know the outcome , and thank you very much for Dave Rodwick who helped us do this project .
I &apos;m not kidding the study in all the details , because you can read them . The next stage was the observation , and here we see some students in the observation , documenting where the bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what do we do ? Student : 5C .
DS : Is it still up here ? Student : Yes .
DS : So you follow every flight . Student : Henry , can you help me ?
BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist says that ?
Student : There are two at the top .
And three here .
BL : We have our observations and our data .
Simple math , estimate , etc . , etc .
Now we want to share that . That &apos;s the next step .
We write it up and we want to publish it . We have to write it .
And of course , we do that in the pub . ( Laughter ) The left is mine , OK ? ( Laughter ) I told them that one piece of paper has four different areas : a guidance , the method , the outcome , the discussion .
The instruction explains the question and why .
The method : What did you do ? The result is , what did you observe ?
And the discussion : who cares about it ?
This is a scientific paper . ( Laughter ) The children called me words , and I wrote the report , so this piece was written in children &apos;s language .
It wasn &apos;t written by me , it was written by Amy and her peers . As a result , the paper starts with , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The result is , &quot; &quot; Coach period , the puzzle ... ta taaaaaaahhh . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The way we put the bees in the refrigerator , and we made beekeeping pie , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we want to negotiate the scientific paper .
This is the front page . We have a series of authors .
Everybody in fat is eight to 10 years old .
The first author is the Blackawton elementary school , and if it &apos;s ever quoted , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Blackawton et , &quot; &quot; and not one by one . We sent it to a public journal , and that was uh .
&quot; &quot; The font underpins our quality standards in a variety of ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It starts with , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the characters are painted with chalk , etc . ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s read it . I sent it to Dale Purves , who in the National Academy of Science , &quot; &quot; and a leading neuroscientist in the world , &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it &apos;s the most disruptive . &quot; ( Laughter )
Larry Maloney , expert in color , says , &quot; The negotiation is excellent . &quot;
&quot; If it was written by adults , you could publish them . &quot; &quot; What did we do ? We sent them back to publisher .
They said no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write an exploration for scientists about the unfolded results , and these were the ones that we celebrated in the recommendations of Biology Letters .
There it was reviewed and published by five independent expert advisers . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) The scientific paper took four months to publish it two years . ( Laughter ) Typical science , what ? So that &apos;s what Amy and her friends publish to the latest scientists in the world .
And what was the feedback ?
It was published two days before Christmas , and 30,000 times a day was downloaded .
It was a review in Science , one of the top science magazines .
It &apos;s available for free for the Biology Letters forever .
It &apos;s the only negotiation that will ever be free in this magazine .
Last year , it was the second-most abrupted document in &quot; &quot; Biology Letters , &quot; &quot; and not only got scientists and teachers , but also from the public .
I &apos;m just reading one .
&quot; &quot; I read &quot; Blackawton bees recently . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have words to describe my feelings .
What you &apos;ve done is really , truly and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocence and excitement are the basis and the most important thing in science .
Who , if not children , has these qualities ?
Please congratulate your children &apos;s team of mine . &quot; &quot; I want to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I try with you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah . Okay .
You take risks in science . That &apos;s a huge risk . ( Laughter ) For me , not for him , because we &apos;ve done it before . ( Laughter ) You like technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Son , but I also like myself .
BL : That &apos;s the definition of technology . All right .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration .
Leave your eyes and show you where you listen to me . Okay ?
( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) You &apos;re all shouting there . One , two , three .
Audience : ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Open your eyes . Once again .
You all smile there . ( Screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) What is that ? It &apos;s about what science does for us .
We go through life and react . If we ever want to do anything else , we have to enter the uncertainty , and when he opened his eyes , he could look at the world with new eyes .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It provides us the opportunity to enter the uncertainty by playing .
Real science education should give people a voice and enables them to express it , and so Amy should have the last word in this short story .
So , Amy ?
AO : This project was really exciting for me because it got the discovery process for life , and it showed me that everybody , and I mean everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a big discovery .
To change the mind of a human being can be easy or hard , and it depends on how this person thinks about change .
I think changing science was amazing . When we started playing and thinking about the mystery , I realized that science is not just a boring subject , and that everybody can discover something new .
You just need the opportunity . My came with Beau and the Blackawton Mountains project .
Thank you . BL : Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — Lomborg &apos;s bestseller — probably that &apos;s a good choice .
( Laughter ) But what I &apos;m going to talk about , what are the big problems in the world ?
And I have to say , before I go on , I ask each of you to try and get out pencil and paper , because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me take a look at how we do that .
So get out your pen and paper .
There are many problems out there in the world .
I &apos;m just going to lift a few of them .
There are 800 million hungry people .
There &apos;s one billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are many millions of people dying of HIV and AIDS .
This list will continue any time .
There are two billion people who are going to be serious about climate change — and so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would all solve them , but we don &apos;t .
In fact , we don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do that , I think the question that we have to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why the talk is in the economic part — that is , if we don &apos;t do all these things , we really have to start asking ourselves , what should we solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had 50 billion dollars over the next four years to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We identified the 10 biggest challenges in the world , and I &apos;m just going to read them briefly : Climate change , transmitted diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , migrations , sanitation and water , subsidies and trade industries .
We think in many ways these are the biggest problems in the world .
So the obvious question is , what do you think are the biggest things ?
Where should we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s the wrong question .
In fact , this was the question that was asked in Davos in January .
But of course , it &apos;s a problem when you ask people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
The biggest problem we have in this world is certainly that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have technology to solve this , right ?
So what it comes to is not to prioritize problems , but it comes to prioritize solutions to problems .
And that would be — of course , this becomes a little more complicated .
Climate change would be similar to Kyoto .
For transmitted diseases , that could be Kurklinids or bed nets .
For conflicts , it would be the U.N. peacekeepers and so on .
So the thing I &apos;m going to ask you to try is , in just 30 seconds — and I know that &apos;s kind of an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
And also — and here , of course , economics will be taboo — write on what the things we shouldn &apos;t do first .
What should be at the end of the list ?
Please take 30 seconds , maybe talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what the top priorities should be , and the conclusion of priorities to solutions that we have for the biggest problems in the world .
The amazing part in this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , I &apos;ve given you a pretty remarkable part of time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go on it , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I encourage you to be sustainable , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions in the night to think about how we prioritize at all ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth has this list never been made ?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do that .
And of course , every organization would love to be on the top of that list .
But each organization would also hate not to be at the top of the list .
And since there are many more non-number one places on the list than Number one plans , it &apos;s absolutely logical not to make that list .
We &apos;ve been doing the U.N. for about 60 years , but we &apos;ve actually never made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , what are we going to do first ?
That doesn &apos;t mean that we wouldn &apos;t prioritize — every decision is a prioritization , so of course , we prioritize for like before , even implicit — and that &apos;s probably not the same as if we actually took prioritization and went and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m intended to really say is that for a very long time , we &apos;ve had a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , nor the orders of magnitude .
We had no idea .
Imagine going to a restaurant and getting the big menu , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , you take a pizza , but you have no idea what the price is .
It could be a dollar , or a thousand dollars .
It could be a family pizza . It could be a very individual pizza vessel , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that &apos;s what the Copenhagen consensus really tries to do — try and give the problems a price tag .
Essentially , this was the process of Copenhagen consensus .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in every field .
So we had three of the world &apos;s best economists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will it cost ? And what will the benefit of it ?
Same thing in transcendent diseases .
Three of the world &apos;s best experts saying , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do about it , and what will the result be ?
And so on .
Then we had some of the world &apos;s best economists , eight of the world &apos;s best economists , including three Nobel laureates , meeting in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; Traumteam . &quot; &quot; The premise of the University of Cambridge decided to call them the Real Madrid of economists .
This works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basically did was create a priorized list .
And then you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy that you asked this question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know about the climate , ask a climatologist .
But if you want to know what you should do first , you can &apos;t ask either of them because it &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing .
That &apos;s what economists do .
They prioritize .
They &apos;re doing this in some ways , in some ways , a terrible job to say , what should we do first , and what should we do about it ?
So that &apos;s the list , and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can see them on the website , and we &apos;ll talk more about them in the course of the day , I &apos;m sure .
They basically came out with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically projects where you invest an aura , but less than a dollar back .
Then there are plenty of projects , good projects and very good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects that we should start with .
I &apos;m going to go backwards so that we stop with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you might see , the bottom line is climate change .
That &apos;s a lot of people in front of your head , and that &apos;s probably one of the things people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it because it &apos;s really strange .
So how did we get here ?
And I &apos;m also going to try to come back because it &apos;s probably one of the things that I disagree with the list they wrote .
The reason they came up with saying that Kyoto — or more than Kyoto — is a bad business is easy because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It doesn &apos;t say global warming is not happening .
It doesn &apos;t say that this is not a big problem .
But it says that what we can do about it is very little , too high cost .
What they basically show us , the average of all macro-economic models , is that Kyoto , if everybody agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a remarkable amount of money .
This is the second or three times of global aid that we have to get to the third world every year .
But it would make it very little .
All models show that global warming drops 2100 by about six years .
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets the tide 2100 can wait until 2106 .
Which is not bad , but not particularly good .
So the idea here is really to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing little good .
And just to give you a sense of the magnitude , the U.N. actually estimate that for half of the amount , for about 75 billion dollars , we could solve all the major problems in the world .
We could provide clean drinking water , sanitation , basic health care , and education for every single human being on this planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend the double amount to do very little ?
Or half of the amount to do amazing things ?
And that &apos;s the real reason it &apos;s going to be a bad project .
And with that , we don &apos;t want to say that if we had all the money in the world , we didn &apos;t want to do it .
But with that , if we don &apos;t have it , it just doesn &apos;t have the highest priority .
The richer projects — notice that I &apos;m not going to comment all — but transmitted diseases , scope of basic health care — have just been able to do it because , yes , more basic health care is a great thing .
It would make a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very expensive .
So what this tells us is that we suddenly start thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , there were lots of sanitation and water projects .
Again , sanitation and water are extremely important , but they also cost a lot in terms of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the four top priorities that should at least be the first to deal with when we talk about how we solve the problems in the world .
The fourth biggest problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
Recent diseases of malaria are due to a few million infected per year .
It could cost up to one percent of GDP per year for affected countries .
If we were to invest about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could halve the disease .
We could prevent 500,000 deaths , but perhaps more importantly , we could prevent roughly one billion people being infected every year .
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with the many other problems that they have to deal with , and of course , in the long run , to deal with global warming .
The third best idea was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we were to reach free trade , and specifically constrained subsidies in the United States and Europe , we could move the global economy forward to an amazing number of 2,400 billion dollars a year that half of them fell in the third world .
Again , the point is that we could actually get two to three hundred million people out of poverty , extremely quickly , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
Not only malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way to deal with malnutrition , which is to address the lack of donor elements .
It &apos;s basically missing about half the world &apos;s population of iron , zinc , Jod and vitamin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could seriously attack the problem .
That would be the second best investment we could make .
And the really best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
If we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we can avoid 28 million cases of HIV / AIDS .
And again , what this project does , and what it relates to is that there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment , the other is prevention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do either of them or do very well , we should at least ask ourselves what we should invest in first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
So basically this says that we can do much more if we invest in prevention .
For the amount of money we spend , we can do the amount of X good in treatment , but 10 times as much good in prevention .
So again , what we &apos;re focusing on is prevention more than treatment , first of all .
What happens here is that we think about our priorities .
I want you to take a look at your priority list , did you do it right ?
Or did you get close to the results you showed here ?
Of course , one of the things about climate change is again .
And I noticed a lot of people will find it very unlikely that we should do this .
We should also address climate change because , if not for other reasons , it &apos;s just such a big problem .
But we don &apos;t care about all the problems , of course .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And I want to make sure that if we focus on problems , we &apos;re also going to do the right thing .
And that &apos;s where we can do a lot of good , rather than a little bit .
And I think — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the Traume team , has done it very well .
One of the things people forget is that in 100 years , so when most climate change we &apos;re talking about , the mosquito will be much , much richer .
Even the most pessimistic scenarios of the U.N.
We estimate that the average residents of a developing country will be about as rich as we are today .
Probably , they will be two to many times as rich as we are today .
And of course we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
The point is , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh of the year 2100 , we don &apos;t talk about a poor Bangladesh .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch .
And the real point is , do we want to spend a lot of money to help the pretty rich Dutch a little bit in 100 years ?
Or do we want to help the really poor people in Bangladesh now who really need help and help us very cheaply ?
Or , as Schelling did , imagine if you were a richer — how you &apos;re going to be — a rich Chinese , a richer Bolivian , a richer Congolese in 2100 , and you &apos;re thinking back to 2005 and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they got so much to help me with climate change , but disproportionately to taking care of it to my grandfather , and giving us a lot more help in my grandfather . &quot;
Even if it &apos;s not the typical way we see the problem .
Of course , it &apos;s mainly because climate change has such good images .
Take &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — that looks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in terms of how I &apos;m sure I want to see him , right , but don &apos;t expect to caste from empathy in his next film Brad Pitt as he &apos;s grabbing in Tanzania latrines or something like that . ( Laughter ) There &apos;s just not so much for a movie .
In many ways , I think about Copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion about priorities as a defense against boring problems .
To make sure that we realize that it &apos;s not about giving us a good feeling .
And it &apos;s not about doing the things that get most of the media attention , but doing the things that we can do most good .
Another objection , as I think , is worth mentioning , is that I — or we — is kind of a false choice .
Of course , we should do all things in an ideal world , I would certainly agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , we decided in the developed world that we would now spend twice as much on the developing world as 1970 .
Since then , our aid has halved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we were actually on the way to solve all the big problems .
Also , people say , well , what about the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spent 100 billion dollars . Why don &apos;t we spend the money to do good in the world ?
I &apos;m quite sure .
If any of you can talk about it , that &apos;s great .
But the point is , of course , if you get another 100 billion dollars again , we want to spend them like we did in the best possible way , right ?
So the point here is that we &apos;re going to come back and think about what the right priorities are .
I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we found ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , at the end you &apos;re asking inevitably old , white American men .
And they &apos;re not tiny , you know , the right ways to look at the whole world .
So we invited 80 young people from around the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two conditions were that they study at university , and they speak English .
Most of them were first from developing countries .
They all had the same material , but they could significantly leave the frame of discussion , and they made it safe to come up with their own lists .
And the surprising thing is that their lists were very similar — with malnutrition and disease at the top and climate change .
We &apos;ve done that many more times .
There were many other seminars and university students and various things .
They all came out with almost the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , to say that I think there is a way to think about priorities , and what is the really important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again , we &apos;d like to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do that , then we can start thinking about where we should start ?
I see Copenhagen consensus as a process .
We did this in 2004 , and we hope to collect many more people together to get a lot better information in 2008 and 2012 .
To plan the right way for the world , but also to think about the political choice .
Now , starting to think about it , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not do the things where we can make little too high cost , not the things we don &apos;t know about , but let &apos;s make great things where we can do enormous contribution to good , to very low cost and immediately . At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion about how we actually prioritize , but we have to be honest and say , when we do some things that we do .
When we worry too much about some things , we don &apos;t end up worrying about other things .
So I hope that this will help us set better priorities and think about how we work better for the world .
Thank you .
Superheroes are many .
But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
So for example , the Catadore , people with the collecting recyclable materials .
The Catadore has a severe , honest and important work that all benefit from , but they don &apos;t get any recognition whatsoever .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the trash that &apos;s recycled .
Many of them work independently , collect the garbage on the streets and sell it affordable to Scotland places .
With bottles , shopping carts , bicycles and Carroças , they collect up to over 300 kilos of waste .
Carroças are wood and metal cars that you see almost everywhere in Brazil , almost like graffiti or road art .
So I first saw this superhero group .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist , my work is social , ecological and political .
In 2007 , I transferred them from the walls to the Carroças to amplify my message in a new urban way .
Back then , mostly to give the Catadore a voice .
With art and humor , the thing will be more appealing , and that helped the Catadore get attention and strengthen their self-confidence .
They &apos;re now famous on the streets , in social and mass media .
The thing is , I fell into this universe and never stopped with my work .
I &apos;ve spent over 200 Carroças in many cities , and I &apos;ve been invited to exhibitions around the world .
And then I realized that the Catadores are not just invisible in Brazil .
I saw them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries like the United States and Japan .
And I realized that I need more supporters because it &apos;s a big challenge .
Thank you .
( Applause )
&quot; &quot; Pimp my Carroça &quot; &quot; is a big crowd-funding project to help the Catadores with their Carroça .
They also get security clothing , gloves , rainjacks and glasses so they can see the city right , while the Carroças are renovated by our volunteers .
They also get security gear : reflectors , copper and mirrors .
Finally , they &apos;re painted by street artists , and they &apos;re part of this big , extraordinary mobile exhibition .
&quot; &quot; Pimp my Carroça &quot; &quot; conquered the streets of São Paulos , Rio de Janeiros and Curitiba .
In order to do this in other cities outside Brazil , we created Pimpx , inspired by TEDx , ( Laughter ) a simplified D-I-Yourself version of Pimp My Carroça .
This is how everyone can participate .
The Catadores are no longer invisible , but they get more respect and recognition .
Through the decent Carroças , they also fight prejudice , their income rises , and they have more contact with society .
Try to see the world without borders or fronts .
Whether you believe it or not , there are over 20 million Catadores around the world .
So if you &apos;re going to see you next , you &apos;ll see it as a very important part of our society .
Muito obrigado , thank you .

About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who gave me a TED Talk about Virtual Earth , the developer at Bing Maps , the technology of Microsoft .
Over the past two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working hard to redefine the way maps work online .
Because we understand a very different category among them than the typical maps of directions that we used to do otherwise .
The first thing you might notice here is how liquid you can zoom in with this , and this is from Seadragon , if you know this .
Mapping , so the mapping on a map , of course , is not just cartography anymore , but it has to do with visual representation .
If we go beyond a particular level in zoom , that leads to a kind of Sim-City-like virtual representation at the 45-degree angle .
You can look at the picture from every sky sky , and you can see the city with all the facade in 3D structure .
We see this three-dimensional space as a canvas that we can transfer to all sorts of applications , and description is really just one of many .
If I click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the applications that we &apos;ve been doing in the last few months since we &apos;ve reached the launch .
For example , we had a few days after the disaster in Haiti , an earthquake map that showed forecast-mimic images from the air .
And this wonderful application that I can &apos;t show you here from the time-lapse , unfortunately , reaches in real time on Hyperlocali blogs and educates their stories and contributions to the places in the map that are coming in in the blogs .
It &apos;s just wonderful .
Instead , I &apos;m going to show you some real gecktail now .
As you can see , of course , the chart doesn &apos;t stop in the sky .
These little green dots are photosynthesis pictures of applications .
I &apos;m not going to show you that too , but these pictures are integrated into the map .
All that &apos;s embedded in blue is an area where we also have images from the ground .
So if you fly down there — ( Applause ) Thank you . As you fly down to the bottom , you see this panoramic sign , and the first thing you probably notice is that this is not just a picture , but that this environment is perceived in three dimensions like the three-dimensional city from the top , so when I click on something to look closer , this transition looks like this . This is a function of this geometry behind the 3D model .
I &apos;m going to show you a funny application that we &apos;re working on with our friends of Flickr .
It takes a localized picture of Flickr and it connects it , in a process that looks like photosynth with our graphics , and I don &apos;t know if I wanted to have the calculations of this picture , but — ( Laughter ) See , this is a popular place for tourists , where there are many photos that have been made at different times .
This is about five o &apos;clock .
This is the Flickr photograph , and this is our chart .
You can see these images coming out of the world of the user being stuck in the map .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
This is interesting for various reasons , for example , for travel .
Now , I can &apos;t show you any of the wobish historical images , because there are also a couple of horses and pulses and so on .
Now , the cool thing about this is that it &apos;s not just about broadding the visual representation of the world with what the users are contributing to it , but that &apos;s also the basis of augmentary reality that I &apos;m going to show you more about in a moment .
I went inside now . This is interesting too .
You can see that now there &apos;s a roof above us .
We &apos;re in the Pike Place market .
This is what we do with a backpacking camera , so we &apos;re not only photographing these cameras on the street with these cameras in cars , but we &apos;re also making images of interior spaces .
And we can make the same connections here , not just from standards , but also from videos .
So let &apos;s try this for the first time , live , and before that , I actually have a very nice bamber .
( Laughter ) Okay .
( Phone Ringing ) Okay , guys , are you there ?
( Laughs ) Okay . I &apos;m going to go on that . I &apos;m going to give it a try .
I &apos;m live . Okay . Here we go .
These are our friends at the Pike Place market , the lab .
( Applause ) You &apos;re sending this live now .
Okay , George , can you turn back to the market in the corner ?
Because I want to show some lightning likes .
No , no . Otherwise .
Yes , yes , back to the corner . Back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you now .
Okay . Okay . Back to the corner . Back to the corner . Back to the corner .
Okay , no matter .
I actually wanted to show you these tendencies up here in the picture , because you feel like you were actually there — you could consider this as a step further than augmentary reality .
What the hell are you doing — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to do two different — Okay , I &apos;m going to put up now .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
First of all , we take real ...
( Laughter ) Okay , let me take the opportunity and thank the team .
They &apos;ve managed to do this absolutely fantastic .
( Applause ) I leave them now and I go out again .
And as I go out , I &apos;m going to tell you very briefly that we &apos;re using this for the telepresence now , but you &apos;re using this in the field for augmentation reality .
If you use it in place , it means you can get all these many metadata and information about the world .
So we &apos;re going to take a next step here by transmitting it live .
This was actually sent on a 4G network from the market .
Now there &apos;s a TED Talk , the last one Microsoft has given in the last few years .
This was Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
We &apos;re going to go over to the garbage containers , where you normally do a break after a long day on the market , or just look in the sky .
Here &apos;s the WorldWide Telescope integrated into our maps .
( Applause ) This is the current — thank you very much . This is the current time , but if we delete these , we can see what the sky is going to look like in different watermarks , and we get very detailed information about different points of time . Let &apos;s look at the moon a little bit higher , and maybe change the date .
I &apos;d like to zoom in on the moon .
This is an astronomically complete representation of the sky embedded directly into the picture of the Earth .
Okay , my time has gone . I have to finish .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
Today I &apos;m going to tell you two things . First of all , what we lost , and two , how we regain it .
So let me start with this .
For me , here &apos;s the thing : this is the Mediterranean Coast , without fish , naked rock and lots of sea birds that like to eat the algae .
This is what I saw when I first jumped into the water on Spain &apos;s Mediterranean Coast .
Now , if an alien came to Earth — call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe jumped into a coral reef , the aliens could see a lot of things .
It &apos;s very unlikely that Joe would land in an untouched coral reef , a young Jewish reef full of corals , sharks , crocodiles , molecules , acid bars , turtles , etc .
So what Joe would probably see would be in this , in the green part of the picture .
Here we see the extreme with dead corals , a soup of microorganisms , and jellyfish .
And where the diver is , there are probably most reefs in the world right now , with very few algae super-endangered corals , many bacteria , and there are the large animals gone .
And that &apos;s what most marine explorers have seen .
They go from this situation . They think of it , of course , because we started modern science using cigarettes for a long time after the degradation of marine ecosystems .
So I put all of us in a time machine , and we go to the left , back to the past to see what the ocean was .
Let &apos;s start with this time machine at the Line Islands , where we did a series of expeditions for National Geographic .
This area is an archipelago that belongs to Kiribati , and stretches across the equator , and there are several uninhabited , uncontained , untouched islands and some familiar islands .
So here &apos;s the first : Christmas Islands , over 5,000 residents .
Most reefs are dead . Most of the coral is dead , supersized by algae , and most fish are smaller than the pinnacles we use to count them .
We flew 250 hours there in 2005 . We did .
Not a single shark .
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 , and he was reporting a huge amount of sharks that were sniffing after their little boats while they were going to land .
So let &apos;s move the regler a little bit further into the past .
Fanning Island , 2,500 residents .
The coral here is better . A lot of little fish .
A lot of divers would think of this as a paradox .
Here you can see the largest part of the living creature in the Florida Keys .
And many people think it &apos;s very , very beautiful if you don &apos;t know anything else .
If we go back to a place like the Palmyra-Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , corals are doing better , and there &apos;s sharks .
You can see sharks in every dive .
And this is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
But when we go back to the regler at 200 , 500 years , we get to the places where the coral is absolutely healthy and beautiful , spectacular structures , and where the predators first fall into the eye , where you can see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
What have we learned from these places ?
And originally , we thought the biomass pyramid was natural .
&#91; Grav.U. : First predators , carnivores , plant carriers , plankton &#93; .
If we were to take all the fish and coral reefs together and weigh , we would expect that .
Most of the biomass is down in the food chain : the crops , the parrot fish , the sticks that eat the algae .
Then the plankton eaters , these little reef bars , the little , floating animals in the water .
And then we have the lower biomass of carnivores , and one even smaller biomass from top predators , which is sharks , the big snapper , the zackenbars .
But that &apos;s an implication .
This worldview is a consequence of exploring degraded reefs .
When we looked for untouched reefs , we realized that the natural world was on its head , and that pyramid was turned around .
The top is now counting for most of the biomass , in some place to 85 percent like the Kingmanriff , which is now protected .
The good thing about this is that there are not just more billboards there , but more of everything .
The scale of these boxes is bigger .
We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , and also more biomass of plant predators , like the paperfish that are like goats in the sea .
They clean the reefs ; everything that &apos;s big enough to be recognized , they eat it , and keep the reef clean and enables the coral to regenerate .
And in all these places — in these old , untouched places — there &apos;s not only a lot of fish , but there &apos;s another important component of the ecosystem , like the giant smuggling ; the lagoon smugglers are completely covered with giant smuggling , up to 20 to 25 per square meter .
These have disappeared from every familiar reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water free of microbes and pathogens .
But there &apos;s global warming .
If there &apos;s no fisheries on a reef , because it &apos;s legal or protected , that &apos;s great .
But the water will die too long and the coral will die .
So how can these fish help these predators ?
Well , we &apos;ve observed in these areas during El Nino , so &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , one thing that the water was too warm for too long , a lot of corals died .
At Christmas Islands , where the food web is very reduced and the large animals have disappeared , the coral hasn &apos;t yet recovered .
In Fanning Island , the coral hasn &apos;t recovered .
But here you see a large tablet that died and collapsed .
And the fish have grazed the algae so the algae cover is a little lower .
Then we go to the palmyra-Atoll , which has more of the biomass of plants , and here are the dead corals clean , and the corals come back .
And if you go to the original site , is it ever blown out ?
These places are also exhausted , but they regenerate faster .
The more intact , the more complete , and the more attractive the food web , the higher the resilience , and the more the system recovers from the short-term effects of warmth .
And that &apos;s good , so we need to rebuild this structure .
We need to make sure that all parts of the ecosystem are there so that the ecosystem can adapt to the impact of global warming .
So if we need to remove the output situation , if we need to push the ecosystem back to left , how can we do this ?
Well , there are different possibilities .
A very obvious one is the marine protected area , especially the protected areas with fisheries that we set up to keep life in the ocean recovery .
And let me go back to the picture of the Mediterranean .
This was my initial situation . This is what I saw as a child .
And at the same time , I looked at Jacques Cousteau shows on television , with this whole wealth , all of the skin and diversity .
And I thought that this wealth would be only in tropical regions , and that the Mediterranean was just a sea without many creatures .
But I had no idea until I first showed up in a marine protected area .
And there I saw this : a lot of fish .
After a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , they eat the sea urchins , and then the algae grow back .
Then there &apos;s a small algae forest , and you can make more than 100 species of algae on the size of a laptop , most of the microscopic small , hundreds of types of small animals that provide the fish , so the system is recovering .
And this place , the marine protected area of the Medes-Islands , is only 94 acres tall , bringing in the local economy six million dollars , 20 times more than fishing , it &apos;s for 88 percent of all the tourism companies .
So these places don &apos;t just help the ecosystem , but also the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
I want to briefly briefly highlight what reserves can do with fisheries .
This is what happens when we protect these places , and then compare them to unprotected places nearby .
The number of species increases by 21 percent , so if there are 1,000 species , you &apos;d expect 200 more in a marine protected area .
It &apos;s very remarkable .
The size of organisms takes about a third , so the fish are now so big .
The skin , how many fish there are per square meter , goes up to almost 170 percent .
And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — the biomass is four and a half times larger , on average , after just five to seven years .
In some places there are more than 10 times greater biomass in the protected area .
So we have all these creatures that live in the reserves , and what do they do ?
They grow . That &apos;s basically population biology .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they die later , so they can grow and reproduce much .
And the wireless is the same . Here &apos;s the example .
These are evangels laid down a snail off the coast of Chile , and so many eggs put them on the sea floor .
And outside the reserve , you can &apos;t even see this .
1.3 million eggs per square meter inside the reserve where there are many of these snails .
So these organisms are multiplying , there are young larvae abundance , there &apos;s everything in abundance , and then you can also move beyond a benefit .
This is on the Bahamas : The Nassau-Zackenbarsch .
There &apos;s a plenty of zackenbars inside the reserve , and the more you get near the reserve , the more fish there are .
So the fishermen start to catch more .
You can see the boundary of the protected area , because the boats are all tied together .
So there &apos;s an overshot , there &apos;s profit beyond the limits of these reservations that help people close , while the reserve protects the entire habitat at the same time . It wins stability .
So what we have now — or a world without reservation — is kind of like a girokonto that we take money from , but never to cut anything .
Reserve rates are like savings companies .
We have this basic framework that we don &apos;t touch , which also produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
And the rise of biomass within the reservation is something like the inflescent .
Two more examples of how these protected areas can use people .
That &apos;s how much money fishermen do every day in Kenya , when they fishing for several years in a place that is unprotected , fishing is free to everyone .
After the most destroyed nets , ringwades pulled out of traffic , fishermen began to catch more .
So if you eat less , you start more .
Whereas if there &apos;s a reserve in fishing , fishermen are earning even more money by fishing around a protected area .
Here &apos;s another example : Nassau-Zackenbara in Belize in the mesoAmerican reef .
This is Zackenbari sex , and the Zackenbars accumulate for a week around the full moon in December and January .
In the old days , tens of thousands of them gathered , there were 30,000 acres in this size on a hectares , in an accumulation .
Fishermen knew that , and they started it , and they implanted the population .
When I was there in 2000 , there were only 3,000 ackenbars left .
And fishermen were able to fish 30 percent of the yellow population every year .
So we did a simple analysis , and you don &apos;t have to be a genius to find out that if you take 30 percent per year , fisheries will collapse very soon .
And at the same time , the whole reproduction capacity of the species breaks together .
This has happened in so many places in the Caribbean .
And for that , they earned 4,000 dollars a year , so for the entire fishing , with several fishing boats .
Now , if you look at the situation economically and look at what would happen if the fish aren &apos;t caught , and if you get 20 divers in a month , the profit is 20 times higher , and that &apos;s sustainable in the long run .
So how much of it are ?
If it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
And you &apos;ve heard that less than one percent of the ocean is protected .
We &apos;re moving closer to one percent now , thanks to the subsidiation of the Chagos-Archipels , and only in a fraction of it is total fishing .
Scientific studies suggest that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
The estimated area is between 20 and 50 percent of a set of goals for biodiversity , improvement in fishing and stability .
So how is this possible ? People would say , how much does it cost ?
So let &apos;s think about how much we pay now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars a year .
Many of these subsidies support destructive fishing species .
Well , there are a few estimates about how much the construction of a network would cost to span 20 percent of the ocean , it would be a fraction of what we pay now , and what the government would pay for a collapsing fishing .
People lose their jobs because fishing breaks down .
The creation of a reserve network would give more than a million people direct work , not forget about all the secondary jobs and benefits .
So we can do that ?
If it &apos;s so obvious that these savings companies are good for the environment and for the people , why aren &apos;t they in 20 to 50 percent of the ocean ?
And how can we achieve that goal ?
Well , there are two ways to get there .
The trivial solution is to create large areas of protected areas like the Chagosh archipelago .
The problem is that we can only build these huge reserves in unpopulated areas without social conflicts , where the political costs are low , and the economic costs are also low .
And some of us , some organizations in this room and elsewhere , are working on it .
But what about the rest of the world &apos;s coast , where are there people living from fishing ?
There are three main reasons why there are not tens of thousands of little reservations : first of all , many have no idea how to function on the function of a marine protected area and fishermen very easily go to the defensive when it comes to regulation or perforation of a small area .
Secondly , there &apos;s a problem with government , because most coastal areas in the world don &apos;t have the need to control the resources to start and promote the reserve .
The hierarchical structure is set downwards — people are waiting for government representatives to come , that &apos;s not effective , and government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
That brings us to the third reason why we don &apos;t have any more protected areas , which is that the middle formation is wrong .
NGOs and governments usually spend a lot of time , money and resources in small areas .
So the protection of the coasts and the ocean has become a broadcast for money from governments and philanthropic institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
So the solutions are all focused on these three issues .
First , we need a global sensibility campaign to inspire local communities and governments to build fisheries protected areas that are better than what we have now .
It &apos;s the savings account for the giroconto without guarantee .
And also , we need to rethink the role of government , so that the protections can be decentralized , so that protections are not dependent on the work of NGOs , or the ministers , and can be created by the communities , as it is in the Philippines and in some other places .
And third , that &apos;s very important , we need to develop new business models .
The broadcasting for compassion as the only way to create reservations is not sustainable .
We need to develop real models , business models , where coastal protection is an investment , because we already know that these marine protected areas bring social , environmental and economic benefits .
And I want to close with one thought , which is that not a single organization will save the ocean alone .
There &apos;s been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new partnership model , in real collaboration , where we &apos;re adding and not replacing each other .
The deployment is just too high to continue as we have .
So let &apos;s go . Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Andersen : Thank you , Enric .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
CA : You &apos;ve really been messing things up really mastery .
First of all , the pyramid , the reverse pyramid , which shows 85 percent of the biomass in the realm that seems impossible .
How can 85 percent survive 15 percent ?
ES : Well , imagine two cogs of a clock , a big and a small one .
The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving very quickly .
That &apos;s it .
The animals at the bottom of the food chain reproduce and grow very quickly , produce millions of eggs .
There &apos;s sharks and big fish up there that live for 25 to 30 years .
They breed very slowly , their metabolism is slow , and they basically preserve their biomass .
The production output of these little guys down there is sort of enough to preserve these contributions of biomass .
They &apos;re like providers in the system .
CA : Very fascinating .
So our image of the food pyramid — we have to reframe it completely .
ES : At least in the ocean .
In the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of Serengeti , where five lions come to a merry .
And it doesn &apos;t work on land .
But at least in coral reefs , there are systems that have a basic component with structure .
We think that &apos;s everywhere .
But we &apos;ve only been studying original reefs recently .
CA : The numbers you showed are really amazing .
So we spend 35 billion dollars on subsidies .
It would cost only 16 billion to convert 20 percent of the world &apos;s ocean into marine protected areas that can even provide new livelihoods .
If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for minus 19 billion dollars .
We could spend 19 billion on health insurance or something like that .
ES : And then there are the weak returns of fishing , that &apos;s 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the biggest solutions is that the World Trade Organization is shifting subsidies to sustainable technologies .
CA : Ah , so there are lots of examples that you hear to stop this nonconventional nonsense .
So thank you for those numbers .
The last one is a personal question .
The experience of the people living with the ocean for a long time was certainly looking at the decline ; they saw beautiful places that were deteriorating and essentially going .
Tell me about the feeling that you had when you went to these original places , and you say things came back .
ES : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We go there to understand the ecosystems and try to count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
But the best feeling is the biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about when people have this sense of awe and wonder , in terms of a mild nature .
And there , and only there , you can really feel being part of a larger thing , or a larger ecosystem .
And if there weren &apos;t those hopeful places , I probably wouldn &apos;t continue this job .
It would just be too depressing .
CA : Okay , Enric , thank you for having given us a part of your spiritual experience . Thank you .
ES : I thank you .
So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m at university and a friend and I start a Roadtrip of Providence , Rhode Island , to Portland , Oregon .
And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we &apos;re driving all the route over side roads , through conservation areas and national parks — basically the longest possible route you can even take .
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my girlfriend and ask her a question that &apos;s been looking at me for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What should the Chinese characters mean that I see on the side of the road all the time ? &quot;
My friend looks completely unintelligible to me .
And by the way , there &apos;s a gentleman in the first row who imitates her facial expressions perfectly .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs that we see all the time , with the Chinese characters on it . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few seconds , and then it breaks out because she figured out what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I meant is this .
( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for Rastspot . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations , just like this — why sometimes we understand the signs around us and how we behave when it happens and what can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as Chris said , I spent the five years thinking about the wrong .
This may seem odd to you as a career choice , but it actually has a big advantage : no competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do all kinds of things to avoid thinking about the wrong , or at least to avoid it , to think about the possibility that we are wrong ourselves .
We understand this at an abstract level .
We all know that everyone in this room makes mistakes .
The human species is fundamentally fallible — so far , so good .
But when it comes to me specifically about everything I believe in in the present , all of a sudden all of this abstract appreciation of malleability for the treasure — and I just don &apos;t care about anything that I could be wrong with .
And the thing is , we live in the present .
We go to meetings in the present ; we make family vacation in the present ; we go to choice and give our voice up in the present .
Everything in everything is that we go through life , caught in this little bubble of certainty , in everything .
I think that &apos;s a problem .
I think that &apos;s a problem for each of us as an individual , in our private and profession lives , and I think that &apos;s a collective problem for all of us as a culture .
So what I want to do today is first of all , talk about why we are trapped in the sense of being right .
And secondly , why this is such a problem .
And finally , I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to leave that feeling behind you , and that if you can , is the greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap that you can do .
So why are we trapped in the feeling of being right ?
One reason actually has something to do with the feeling of wrong .
Now , let me ask you something — or let me ask you the question because you &apos;re sitting right here : What does it feel like — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
Amazing . Dumb down .
Clearly . Okay , wonderful , good .
Recently , thumb down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but it &apos;s answers to a different question .
They answer the question : How does it feel like you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) Undering that you &apos;re wrong , you can feel exactly like this and you can feel very different , right ?
I mean , it can be devastating , it can be striking , it can actually be very funny , like my stupid myth with the Chinese characters .
But just feeling wrong , nothing feels nothing at all .
Let me show you an analogy .
Remember the cartoon &quot; &quot; Loony Tunes , &quot; &quot; with this pity of compelling coyote that always hunts the Renncuckuck and never starts it ?
In almost every consequence of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment when the coyote hunts the Rennuckuck and the Rennuckuck runs over a cliff , which is okay , because he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
But the thing is , the coyote runs right after him about the cliff .
And what &apos;s funny about it — at least when you &apos;re six years old — is that it &apos;s perfectly fine for the coyote .
He just keeps running — right up to the moment he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s floating in the air .
That &apos;s the moment it falls .
If we &apos;re wrong with something — not when we realize it , but before — we &apos;re like the coyote after it &apos;s running over the cliff and looking down .
You know , we &apos;re wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we think we &apos;re on a fixed ground .
So I should correct something I just said .
It feels like we &apos;re wrong ; it feels like we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) So this is a reason , a structural reason , why we feel we &apos;re right , are trapped .
I call this false blindness .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have an internal fingertitle that shows us that we &apos;re wrong with one thing until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s another reason why we are trapped in that feeling — and this is cultural .
Think about primary school for a second .
You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is giving tears back , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in elementary school , and you know exactly what to do with the child who gets this bow .
This is the stupid kid who makes trouble , one that never does his homework .
And if you &apos;re nine years old , first of all , you &apos;ve learned that people who make things wrong are lazy , responsible heads — and two , you &apos;re successful in life if you don &apos;t make mistakes .
We learn this really bad lesson really well .
And many of us — and I suspect , especially many of us in this room — react to just becoming a perfect one-student , perfection artists , overeivers .
Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoners ?
( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFOs , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners .
That &apos;s okay .
Except that we are then freaking out at the opportunity to get ourselves wrong .
Because according to this , if you do something wrong , something is wrong with us .
So we insist that we are right because we feel like we are smart and accountable and talented and on the safe side .
I want to tell you a story .
A few years ago , a woman came to an operation in the Beth Israel Deaconess-hospital .
Beth Israel is in Boston .
It &apos;s the university clinic at Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So the woman comes in and is brought to the OP .
She gets narcotics , and the surgeon does his thing — sew it back , send it into the elevator room .
Everything seems to be fine .
And she wakes up , and she looks down and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body connected ? &quot; &quot; Now , the wrong side of her body is connected because the surgeon has done a big operation on her left rather than on her right leg .
When the Vice director for the quality of health care in the Beth Israel talked about this incident , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; Why , the surgeon just thought to be on the right side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point here is that too much trust can be on the right side of anything , can be very dangerous .
This inner sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable reference to what &apos;s actually happening in the external world .
And if we pretend that it would be and stop looking at the possibility that we could be wrong , well , it ends up doing things like 200 million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or to go into the global economy .
So this is a big practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a big social problem .
Think for a moment about how it is to feel right .
It means that you think your beliefs are just perfectly reflecting the reality .
And if you feel that way , you &apos;re faced with a big problem that would be there : How can you explain all the people who are not your opinion ?
So most of us are explaining these people in the same way by stepping back into a series of unhappy assumptions .
The first thing we do when we &apos;re not agreed is to assume that those are ignorant .
They don &apos;t have access to the same information as us , and when we generalize this information with them , they will look at the light at the end of the tunnel and change on our side .
If that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out , people have the same facts as us , and they still don &apos;t agree with us , then we go to a second assumption , which is that they are idiots .
( Laughter ) They have all the appropriate puzzle pieces , and they &apos;re mentally not able to put them together correctly .
And if that doesn &apos;t work , if it turns out that people who don &apos;t agree with us have the same facts as we and are quite smart , then we go to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they distort them in terms of their own vicious intentions .
This is a disaster .
This fidelity to our own rightness keeps us from avoiding mistakes when it &apos;s really necessary and it makes us treat each other horribly .
But what &apos;s the most amazing and tragedy about this for me is that it &apos;s not going to be the essence of humanity .
It &apos;s as if we want to imagine that our mind is an absolutely transparent window , and we just look out and describe the world as it unfolds in front of us .
And we want everybody else to look through that same window and see exactly the same thing .
But it &apos;s not that , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
The miracle of your mind is not that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it &apos;s not .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it is like to be another person in a different place .
And we all do that a little bit differently , and so we can all look in the same night sky and see this , and also this one .
And yes , that &apos;s also why we understand things wrong .
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about , &quot; &quot; I think so I am , &quot; &quot; this man named St. Augustinus and wrote , &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; — &quot; I &apos;m wrong , so I am . &quot;
Augustinus understood that our ability to cheat things is not a kind of embarrassment in the human system , something that we can eradicate or overcome .
It &apos;s an absolutely fundamental part of our self .
Because unlike God , we don &apos;t really have a clue of what &apos;s going on here .
And unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure it out .
For me , this obsession is the source and root of all our productivity and creativity .
For various reasons , I heard a lot of implications of the public radio show last year called The American Life .
And so I hear and I hear , and at some point I feel like somehow all stories are about being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s it .
I became the crazy Irtumn Lady .
I just see it everywhere . &quot; &quot; Which has happened .
But a few months later , I had the opportunity to interview Ira Glass , the moderator of the program .
And I mentioned this to him , and he said , &quot; &quot; No , that &apos;s really true .
In fact , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; The team doubled that every single outcome of our program has the same secret issue .
And the secret issue is , &quot; &quot; I thought this one thing would happen , and then something else happened instead . &quot; &quot; And the fact is , &quot; &quot; Ira Glass says , &quot; &quot; We need that .
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and error to tell these stories . &quot; &quot; And the rest of us , presence , as audience , as readers , we suck up this stuff .
We love things like twisted acts and false currencies and a surprising ending .
When it comes to our stories , we love to be wrong .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think this one thing will happen , and something else happens instead of it .
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of mass destruction weapons , free the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened instead of that .
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be dictator for the rest of his life in Egypt until he was too old or too sick and his sovereignty could pass on to his son .
And something else happened instead of that .
And you might have thought that you would grow up and marry your first love from high school and go back to your hometown and raise some children together .
And something else happened instead of that .
And I have to tell you that I thought I &apos;d write this incredibly nervous book about a subject that everybody would hate , for an audience that would never give it .
And something else happened instead of that .
( Laughter ) I mean , that &apos;s life .
We make these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world is turning around and surprised us .
Nothing for unhappy , but this whole conference is an incredible mindset of our ability to make things wrong .
We just spent a whole week talking about invention and progress and improvement , but you know why we need all these inventions and progress and improvements ?
Because half of what &apos;s most amazing and revolutionary — TED 1998 — isn &apos;t it ?
( Laughter ) Something didn &apos;t work , right ? ( Laughter )
Where is my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So now we &apos;re back here .
And that &apos;s how the hare goes .
We develop a different idea .
We tell a different story .
We have another conference .
The theme of this , as you &apos;ve all heard about seven million times by now , is the rediscovery of wonder .
And for me , if you really want to rediscover the wonder , you have to step out of your little , in fear of rigid space of justice and looking at each other and look at each other and look out into the expansion and complexity and the mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I have no idea .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayid Nosair went to a hotel in Manhattan , and he hired a deadly attribute to Rabbi Meir Kahane , the founder of Jewish Defense League .
Nosair was finally convicted of his tendency in the attack .
El-Sayid Nosair is my father .
I looked up at these men .
These men I called &quot; &quot; ammu , &quot; &quot; which means as much as &quot; &quot; uncle &quot; &quot; means .
So what opened my eyes ?
Another important turning point came when I got a job in the summer in the &quot; &quot; Busch Gardens , &quot; &quot; a forecast park .
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
It &apos;s very simple .
Instead , I use my experience to fight against terrorism , to fight anatism .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m delighted to be here .
I &apos;m honored about invitation , thank you .
I &apos;d love to talk about things that interest me , but unfortunately I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in is not a lot of other people .
First of all , my testimony says I &apos;m an astronomer .
I would love to talk about astronomy , but I think the number of people who care about radiation outcomes in non-gray atmospheres and light polarization in the upper atmosphere of the Jupiter is the number of people who fit into a warehouse .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
( Laughter ) It would be as much fun to talk about some things that happened in 1986 and 1987 when a computer hacker got into our system over here in Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
And I captured the guys , and it turned out they worked for what was then the Soviet KGB and stolen information .
And I &apos;d love to talk about it — and it would be fun — but 20 years later ...
I find computer security , frankly , quite boring .
It &apos;s tired .
I &apos;m — if you do something for the first time , it &apos;s science .
The second time it &apos;s engineering .
The third time you &apos;re just a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . After doing something , I do something else .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
I &apos;m not going to talk about things that , I think , are apparent statements from my first book , Silicon Snake Oil , or my second book , I &apos;m going to talk about why computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
I feel like a huge and bizarre idea is that we need to put more computers in schools .
My idea is no ! No !
Put them out of schools and drop them out of schools .
And I would love to talk about it , but I think the argument is for anyone who has ever been close to a 4.class was so obvious that you don &apos;t have to say much about it — but I think I might be very wrong here , and everything else I &apos;ve said .
So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
There &apos;s probably the same lying in there .
After I said that — I took my talk five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And if you look at this , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
I want to talk about the future , right ?
OK . And I feel like talking about the future is bizarre , because I have gray hair , so it &apos;s pretty absurd for me to talk about the future .
In fact , I think if you really want to know what the future is going to be , if you really want to know about the future , they don &apos;t ask technologists , scientists , physicists .
No ! Don &apos;t ask anybody to write the code !
No , if you want to know how society is going to be in 20 years , ask a pediatrician .
They know .
Rather , don &apos;t ask any child gardener , ask a experienced experience .
Those are the ones who know how society will be in a generation .
I don &apos;t know . I guess there are many other people talking about what the future will be .
Certainly , each of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
But for me , things are not the future .
What I &apos;m asking is , how is society going to be when the kids today are so phenomenal on the news and spend a lot of time on the screen , but have never been bowling together .
It &apos;s a change , and what &apos;s changing is not software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it would be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing right now . What am I doing ?
Oh — the other thing I think I &apos;d like to talk about is over here . Right here .
Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about are one-page things .
I would like to talk about things that only have one side .
Because I love furniture shops . I love furniture shops not only , but I &apos;m actually one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world who make small hands .
I hope all of your eyes are beginning to glance .
This is a flap .
For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup . I know everything about it .
She &apos;s one-sided . She &apos;s a bottle of her downside as well as her outside .
It &apos;s got a volume of zero , and it &apos;s nonoriented .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two furniture slices and you sew their common sewers together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
And I &apos;d love to talk about it , but I don &apos;t have a lot about — say things because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;m cold . ) Anyway , the D &quot; &quot; in TED , &quot; &quot; of course , is for design .
Just two weeks ago , I did — you know , I made little , medium and big pockets for the exhibition .
But I just — and I &apos;m pleased to show you here for the first time in the public .
This is a plain-bottleneck bottle , which , although in four dimensions , it shouldn &apos;t be able to contain a liquid , is perfectly capable of containing because our universe has only three dimensions of space .
And because our universe has only three dimensions of space , it can contain fluids !
It &apos;s high — this is the cool one .
This was a month of my life .
But even though I &apos;d love to talk to you about topography , I &apos;m not going to do it .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mum that died last summer .
Has photos taken by me , how mothers do this .
Can anybody project this guy up ?
And I looked at her album , and she saved a picture of me standing in 1969 a few regulators — you know , sitting there .
And I looked at it and I said , &quot; Oh my God , that was when I was working at the electronic music studio !
As a technician , I &apos;ve fixed and maintained the electronic music studio at the State of New York State of Buffalo , and whoa !
Time machine . And I said , oh yeah !
And she sent me back .
Shortly after that , I found another picture she had , a picture of me .
That guy over there , of course , I am .
This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog-synthesizer , who died this August .
Robert Moog was a generous , nice person ; an extraordinarily competent engineer .
A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a student at the SUNY Buffalo .
He came from Trumansburg to teach me things , not just about the Moog synthesizer , we were sitting there — I studied physics at the time . This was 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We studied physics , I studied physics , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing .
Don &apos;t depend on the electrochemical music if you do physics . &quot; &quot; My mentor . He came up and spent an hour with me .
He wrote me a recommendations so that I could go to graduate school .
In the back of my bike .
I know this picture was taken in my friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Moog came along and took a mountain of equipment around Greg Flint and showed me things with it .
We were sitting around talking about transformations , visceral functions , modulation transactions , things like that .
Bobs death this summer was a loss for all of us .
Anyone who &apos;s a musician today was deeply influenced by Robert Moog .
( Applause ) And I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about what I &apos;m going to do . What I &apos;m going to do — I hope you can see that there is a deformed sine wave , a almost triangular wave on this Hewlett-Packard-Oszilloscope .
Oh cool . I can go over here , right ?
Children . Children are what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
Here &apos;s children , I &apos;d like to talk about that .
I decided , at least for me , that I don &apos;t have enough head .
So I think local and hand-local .
I think I can best help when I &apos;m very , very local .
So Dr. here and graduate school , and yadda yadda .
I spoke to some teachers about these things about a year ago .
And one of them , some of them came to me and said , &quot; How is it that you don &apos;t teach ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate students — I &apos;ve been a Ph.D. student , and I &apos;ve also given lectures to students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so interested in children , and everything is interesting , how come you &apos;re not here at the front lines ?
Let your words follow action . &quot; &quot; Right . Right . I teach science for four days a week to watch science .
Not just to dive up and show up .
No , no , no , no , no . I &apos;m here .
I take lunch walks . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , don &apos;t clap .
I recommend that for each of you , that would be a good thing .
It &apos;s not just going to go out and get in class .
Do teach a whole week . Okay , I just have a three-quarter , but anyway .
One of the things I did for my students was to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you physics at university .
No calculus , I &apos;ll take that out .
You will not need to learn trigonometry .
But you &apos;re going to need farm algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
No &quot; Open your book in chapter seven and do all the tasks . &quot;
We &apos;re going to do real physics here . &quot; &quot; And I thought that &apos;s one of the things I &apos;m going to do now .
( High-frequency notes ) Oh , before I even turn it on , something we did about three weeks ago in my class — that was through a lens , and one thing we needed was a lens to measure the speed of light .
My students in El Cerrito — of course , with my help , and using a very low-income oscilloscope , measured the speed of light .
We were 25 percent wrong . How many eighth-graders do you know that measured the speed of light ?
And in addition , we measured the speed of sound .
I would love to measure the speed of light here .
I was prepared , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man , &quot; &quot; I wanted to put the powerful here and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m prepared for that . I &apos;m prepared for it , but then it turns out you only have 10 minutes to build this .
And I didn &apos;t have enough time to do that .
So maybe the next time I &apos;m going to measure the speed of light .
But , in the meantime , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound .
The most obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound somewhere and look at the echo .
But probably — one of my students , Ariel , asked , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light by using the light equation ? &quot;
And each of you knows the equation : the frequency of each wave &apos;s wavelength ...
It &apos;s a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength goes smaller . The wavelength goes up , the frequency gets smaller . So if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s the interesting — if the sound gets higher , it &apos;s all closer together , clay gets smaller , it &apos;s all expanding .
Right ? That &apos;s simple physics .
Any of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth grade physics — but they should have done it — and I wish they had — is that if you multiplied the frequency with the wavelength of the sound , or the light you get a constant .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
So to measure the speed of sound , I just need to know the frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
I have a frequency counter here .
You put it on a three-step A. That &apos;s a A , more or less .
Now I know the frequency .
It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelengths .
All I have to do now is sniff a different beam , and the bottom chair is like I &apos;m talking , right ?
Every time I speak , you see it on the screen .
I put it over here , and as I move it away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
Move like a Slinky . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave coming out in this direction .
The physicists among you , I hear you swirl your eyes , but have patience with me . ( Laughter ) In order to measure wavelengths , I just have to measure the distance from here , a complete wave , up to here .
From here to here , the wavelength of sound .
So I &apos;m going to put a tape up there . And then I &apos;m going to move it back to here .
I moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
OK , back to Mr. Elmo .
And we say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s calculate what that is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
If you look at it in the book , it &apos;s actually 343 .
But with noisy materials and lousy drinks — we managed to measure the speed of sound — not bad . Pretty good .
That all leads to what I wanted to say .
Look at the picture of me a million years ago .
It was in 1971 , the Vietnam War was just going , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I study physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
I go home about the holidays . There were exceptions on the campus .
There were rituals ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s finished .
There are riots on the campus , and the police are tracking me , OK ?
I walk across the campus . Policeman comes up , and he looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Get a gun . Bumm !
And a tapestry cable is about the size of a carpet can fly past my head . Whoosh !
I get a wall of drinks , and I can &apos;t breathe .
The policeman is following me with a gun .
He wants to blow me one over the wheel !
I say to myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get out here ! &quot; &quot; I run over the campus as fast as I can . I go to Hayes Hall .
This is one of these gickle buildings .
The policeman is following me .
And follow me the first , second , third floor .
And follow me in this room .
The entrance to the Glockenturm .
I &apos;m putting the door behind me , sticking up , coming in a place where I see a pendulum swing .
And I think , oh , exactly , the square of the length is proportional to the periodic digestive . ( Laughter ) I keep sticking up .
I come to a place where a dune has broken off .
There &apos;s pipes , there &apos;s pipes , there &apos;s pipes , there &apos;s pipes , there &apos;s pipes .
Time goes backwards because I &apos;m on the inside .
I think of limitations and Einstein &apos;s relativity .
I &apos;m going to kick up , and there &apos;s a place , way back , where you climb up this wooden ladder .
I get up there , and there &apos;s a wolves .
A dome , like a three-foot dome .
I look out , and I see policemen coming in on the head of Student heads , dipping down gaps , and I see students throwing rocks .
And I wonder , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? Then I remembered what my English teacher said to me in high school .
And that is that in the Glockeni Embassy , the scripts are being brought up .
So I wipe the dive off one of the bells and look at it .
And I wonder , why am I here ? At this point , I &apos;d like to tell you what words put on the bells of Hayes Hall : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
Whether in this light , science and religion aspire to the steady evolution of humanity , from the darkness to light , from anxiety to generosity , from prejudice to tolerance .
It &apos;s the voice of life that calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
When I stood on the porch and crawled in my pockets , I realized that my keys were missing .
I could see them through the window , they were on the dining table where I left them .
I ran around the house and I tried all the other doors and windows that were closed .
I started calling a loose , because I had my mobile phone , but at midnight it could take till a loser came , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t cross with my friend Jeff because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning and needed my travel pass and suitcase .
And desperately and frozen , I found a big stone , and I crushed it down so that the window of the window , cleaned the glass sheet , climbed in , found a piece of cardboard , and pasted it over the hole , with the thought , the morning , on the way to the airport , calling my lighter , with the request to fix it .
That would cost a lot , but probably not more than a loser in the middle of the night , so I thought , under those circumstances , it comes out the same way .
I &apos;m a guided neuroscientist , and I know a little bit about how the brain behaves at stress .
It emits Cortisol , which elevates the heartbeat , it corresponds to the adrenaline level on it , and it angles the mind .
The next morning , I was sleeping too little , and I was worried about the hole in the window , and I had to think about calling my developer , and in the frozen temperatures and the standing meetings in Europe with all the Cortisol in my brain , my thinking was blown up , but I didn &apos;t know that because my thoughts were just blown away .
( Laughter ) It was only when I stood on the check-off switch at the airport that I realized my desk was missing . ( Laughter )
So in 40 minutes , I rolled through snow and ice , I got my bass and I got back to the airport , I just managed to do it , but my place was already forgive , which I ended up landing next to the bathroom at the end of the plane , in an unthinkable seat , in an eight-hour flight .
I had a lot of time thinking in these eight hours without sleep .
( Laughter ) And I wondered if there are things I can do , mechanisms that I can perform that can prevent outcomes from bad things ?
You all know what the post-morality is .
As Danny explained , as he said , you look forward to see what could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what to do so that these things can &apos;t interfere , or to minimize the damage .
What I want to talk about today is a few things that we can do in the form of a personal morality .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not .
I &apos;m going to start with the obvious ones .
Take a place at home for things you lose easily .
It sounds very logical , and it &apos;s also , but there &apos;s a lot of science behind it that &apos;s based on how our spatial memory works .
A part of the brain called hippocampus has evolved over tens of thousands of years to track where important things have been laid down — where the well is , where you can find fish , the place with the fruits , where the unfinished and the refined tribes live .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
And if you ask yourself , somebody did the experiment , where the smell of squirrel was turned off , and they still found their nuts .
They didn &apos;t use smell , they used the hippocampus , this very sophisticated mechanism in the brain to find things .
It &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move much , but not so good for things that move .
That &apos;s why we lose car keys , readers and tracheese .
Put a place in your house for your keys — a hook next to the door , maybe a beautiful dish .
For your bass , a specific shoe .
For your readers , a certain table .
If you set up a certain place and keep in mind , your things will always be there if you look for them .
What about travel ?
Make a mobile phone photograph of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your pot , email it to be in the cloud .
These are pretty obvious things .
Don &apos;t forget , stress , your brain shouts out Cortisol .
Cortisol is toxic and causes inclusive thinking .
Part of the pre-mortar is to realize that stress is not in its best form and should prepare mechanisms for it .
There &apos;s probably no more stressful situation than if you &apos;re faced with a medical decision .
I &apos;m going to talk about a particular disease picture .
But this will be an example of any medical decision and even decision making in finance and social — any kind of decision making that could benefit from rational assessing the facts .
Suppose you go to the doctor and he says , &quot; I &apos;ve got your results back from the lab , and your cholesterol is a little bit higher . &quot;
Now you all know that high cholesterol is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
Over the number of treatments we need .
What exactly is that ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take a drug or have an operation or have to do a process before one person gets helped .
You think , what is this crazy statistic ?
The number should be one .
But medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
This is not what the doctor blame when someone is blamed , then scientists like me .
GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs only work at 30 to 50 percent of people .
What do you think is the number of necessary treatments for the most prescribed bed bed ?
How many people have to take it before it &apos;s helped ?
I tested the numbers themselves .
300 people have to take the drug a year before a heart attack , or a stroke or something like that .
Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Okay , one : 30 chance to lower my cholesterol .
Why not ? Give me the recipe anyway . &quot; &quot; But here you should ask for another statistic , which is , &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot;
For this particular drug , side effects occur at five percent of the patients .
It &apos;s 15 times more likely to harm you the means than it helps you .
I &apos;m just saying that you should talk to your doctor about it .
You have the right to this information to decide whether you want to take the risk or not .
For the most abundant surgery on men over 50 , exception of prostate cancer , the number of treatments needed are 49 .
Right , 49 surgeries are required before one person has helped .
And this is where the side effects occur at 50 percent of the patients .
These include impotence , disorder disorders , harnincontinence , stomach darkness , chair control .
If they &apos;re one of the happiest 50 percent to respond to , they only hold one or two years .
And you should also think of things like quality of life .
Because you often have the choice , do you want a shorter , painful life or a longer life , that might end up being very painful ?
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for that .
Confronted with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if your body takes metabolism , and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might be able to lunch the lion and the rest doesn &apos;t matter .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes down the bach during the stress period is the rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
So we need to train to think of these kinds of situations in advance .
The most important point is to recognize that we are all flawed .
We &apos;re all going to lose weight and fail .
It &apos;s about thinking about what mistakes this could be to provide mechanisms that minimize harm , or prevent the impact of bad things from preventing .
And I have to admit , I still have a bunch of unsortized mail and a lot of emails I haven &apos;t read yet .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning .
Are you awake ?
They took me off my naming sign , but I wanted to ask , did anyone write their name in Arabic on sign ?
Anybody ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , not too long ago , I was sitting with a friend in a restaurant and I was eating food .
So I looked at the waitress and I said , &quot; Do you have a menu in Arabic ? &quot;
He looked at me as if he had missed .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry . ( English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu , please . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s called ? &quot; &quot; And I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called menu &apos; ( English ) or menu . &quot; &quot; Is the French language correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come , come on , take care of those ! &quot; &quot; the waiter said .
He was conflicted when he was talking to me as if he thought to himself , &quot; Even if this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
What does it mean to say &quot; &quot; formula &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Two words made a Lebanese young man a girl as a backward and ignorant .
How could she speak that way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking about it .
It made me angry .
It definitely hurts .
I am denied to speak my own language in my country ?
Where else could that happen ?
How did we get there ?
While we &apos;re here , there are many people like me who are reaching a point in their lives where they volunteer to give up everything that &apos;s happened to them in the past just so they can say they &apos;re modern and civilized .
Should I forget my culture , thoughts , my mind and my memories ?
Kindle memories may be the best memories of war !
Should I forget everything in Arabic so I &apos;m adapted ?
To be one of them ?
Where is the logic ?
Despite that , I tried to understand him .
I didn &apos;t want to deny him as hard as he convicted me .
The Arab language doesn &apos;t satisfy the needs of today .
It &apos;s not a language of science or research , no language that we &apos;re used to at university , no language that we use in the workplace , no language that we work with in a modern research project , and certainly no language we use at the airport .
If we did , we would flamish .
So where can I use them ? We can all ask this question !
You want us to use Arabic . Where can we do that ?
That &apos;s one reality .
But we should think about another , even more important reality .
Arabic is mother language .
Researchers say that other languages &apos; delusion predicts the mastery of their own native language .
Mastering your own mother &apos;s language is premise .
Khalil Gibran . When he started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , imaginations and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , inspired , who had a particular smell in the nose , a certain voice in the ear , a particular thought in his head .
When he started writing English , he had enough sticks .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his English script , you smell the same odor , you feel the same feeling .
You can imagine that he &apos;s writing in English , the same boy who came out of the mountains from a village in Lebanon .
So this is an example that no one can disagree with .
The second is often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to destroy its language .
That &apos;s a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese .
They make them sacred .
That &apos;s why they use them in production .
Well , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we &apos;d like to bring in the civilized world .
Countries that used to be like us , but they decided to go for development , explore and recover the other countries , like Turkey , Malaysia and others , they took their language as they climbed up the ladder , protected them as a diamond .
They kept them close to themselves .
If you get a product out of Turkey or anything else , and it &apos;s not in Turkish , it &apos;s not a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t think it &apos;s a local product .
They would become consumers again , unemployed consumers , like we are most of the time .
To create and produce innovations .
It doesn &apos;t work , right ?
Understand who , how and why .
Language is not just for communicating .
So if we say &quot; &quot; freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you shapes a sense of it in your mind , there are certain feelings from a particular day of a particular historical period .
Language is not one , two or three together words or letters .
It &apos;s an idea that has a relationship with our kind of thinking ; how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our mind ?
How can you say whether this guy understands or not ?
When I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , ( English ) &quot; or if your son comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived in the time of the free spelling ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem in it , I should go better and stop wasting my time .
The idea is that this express will remind us of certain things .
I have a French language friend who married a French friend .
I once asked them how things are going .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all OK . Only one time I spent a whole night trying to translate him the meaning of the word &quot; &quot; toqborni . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman , in a sense , said to him , &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then tried to explain this to him all night .
He was confused with the thought , &quot; &quot; How can someone be so gray ?
Do they want to commit suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Am I kidding ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that she can &apos;t tell her husband because he wouldn &apos;t understand it , and he &apos;s right to do it ; his kind of thinking is different .
Consider that for me .
( Applause ) What did we do to protect the Arab language ?
We made it a cause of civil society , and we have a campaign for perception .
Forget this problem and have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign for recognizing the Arab language has the motto : &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , no , we accept this or this . We didn &apos;t accept this style because we wouldn &apos;t understand it .
Because when someone talks to me like this , I hate the Arab language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you answered it from the West , &quot; &quot; brought it to the point .
Something very simple and yet creative and conviction .
Then we launched another campaign with a writer on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside , a writer , surrounded by black and yellow band , which says , &quot; Don &apos;t touch your language ! &quot;
Why ? In fact , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill our language , we would have to find an identity .
We &apos;d have to find a existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
That means far more than just our chance to miss .
We &apos;re very cool !
And to anyone who says , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; cool . &quot; &quot; Let them disagree how they want , but give me a word that &apos;s better and better adapted to reality .
I &apos;m going to keep saying &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; ( English ) I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the global network . &quot; &quot; ( Arabic ) ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t hide ourselves .
But in order to get to that point , we all have to be convinced that we should not allow anybody to be bigger than us or think that he &apos;s in spots of language about us , to control us or to make us feel like they want to .
Creativity is the idea .
If we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket , and so , we can be creative .
At this moment , each of you is a creative project .
Creativity in your mother &apos;s language is the way .
Let &apos;s start from that moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
A single novel can get us global again .
He can bring the Arab language back to place one .
There &apos;s no solution , right . There &apos;s a solution !
But we need to know this , and be convinced by a solution , that we have the duty to be part of this solution .
And as a conclusion , what can you do today ?
And Tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
Please , I ask you , even though my time is around , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic .
You would enter a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from a place like this .
Second , there are many more things we can do .
We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to pay attention to the need .
A baby identifies his father first by language .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s take this cultural awkward . ( Applause )
Sustainability embody what , where and how the fishery is .
Those who and why are central to me ?
I want to know the people who are behind my food elections .
I want to know how I influenced them .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how far they depend on the fillings of the water to earn a living .
And to be able to reconstruct all of this , it allows us to change our perception of ocean pricing , away from a raw material , to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
This allows us to appreciate the marine mammals that we can be happy to appreciate and honor them .
And what do we call this whole thing ?
I would say we call it regenerating seafood .
Where sustainability means to regret and maintain injustice is the ability to recover and make progress .
The idea of sampling seafood cues a developing and dynamic system , and recognizes our relationship to the ocean as a resource by asking them to restore the ocean and promote its resilience .
It &apos;s a hopeful , more human and a more useful way to understand our environment .
Tell leaders — again , a strip point among many in the world of ocean conservation — are very useful , they are a wonderful means .
Green , yellow and red are categorizing marine species .
The connection is very simple : buy green , not buying red , thinking about yellow twice .
But I think it really isn &apos;t enough to just keep on the green list .
We cannot go through that without the measure of our success really changes the fate of species in the yellow and the Red List .
But if we just eat the green list ?
Here we have tuned yellowfin tuna — it comes from sustainable populations .
With the angel — no bycatch .
Good for fishermen . Good money . Be the local economy .
But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
What &apos;s the background of that meal ?
Do I have a 450 pounds of it in a steak house ?
Do I do that three times a week ?
I still may be in the green list , but I don &apos;t do myself , nor you , or the ocean , any favor .
The point is that we need a connection , a measure of our actions around the world .
For example , I &apos;ve heard that Rotwein is good for health — antioxidants and minerals — healthy for the heart .
That &apos;s great ! I love Rotwein !
I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
And , like many bottles , do you tell me I have a problem ?
Now people , we have an protein problem .
We lost that empathy when it comes to our food , and we pay a price for it .
The problem is we hide that price under the waves .
We hide that price behind the social acceptance of growing waist-tags .
And we hide that price behind huge wins .
The first thing is to say about the idea of regenerating seafood that it actually takes into account of our needs .
Regenerative marine creatures are best represented by &quot; &quot; The white shark , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Flipper , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; cheese &apos; n Iglo , &quot; &quot; but rather from &quot; &quot; Jolly Green Giant &quot; &quot; — the vegetable .
vegetables : they could save the ocean .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
Well , I have the honor to announce that Broccoli green could be the new blue .
We need to continue to eat the best possible seafood if anything .
But we also have to eat a lot of vegetables .
But the best thing about renewables in the ocean is that they &apos;re preserved in half a shell dish with a bottle of tobacco and citront scars .
They &apos;re served as 140th Portion Buntbarsch , pantured with Dijon-Senp and crawling , curved breadcutter and a damn mountain of Pekannus Reis with little , grilled Broccoli so soft and smooth and out and smoke with a little pond of Chili .
Ohh !
That sells good .
And the best part is that all of these ingredients are available for every family in the next supermarket .
Jamie Oliver is involved in protecting America from our food habits .
Sylvia enters the ocean in front of our food habits .
Here &apos;s a pattern that can see .
Forget the atomic ferno ; it &apos;s the cables that we have to worry about .
We &apos;ve devastated our Earth , and the food that we &apos;ve raised from it has been used to impress ourselves in more than one way .
So I think that we have a completely wrong eating behavior .
And I think it &apos;s time to change our demand for food .
Sustainability is complicated , but a food is a fact that we all understand very well .
So let &apos;s start with this .
More recently , there was a lot of movement to make our food systems more environmentally friendly .
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are passionate about the Cultural Revolution for ecological food .
But ecological food , for us , often represents a way to integrate our responsibility as a food .
Just because it comes from an ecological source doesn &apos;t mean that we can treat it on the plate with indifference .
There &apos;s oily shrimp .
We can make them ; we have the technology to do it .
But we will never have a co-friendly all-you-can-scanning Shrimps Buffet .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Meals that are good for the heart represent an important part of the regenerating seafood .
While we &apos;re struggling to get diminishing marine populations into grip , the media is recommended by ocean use .
Research would have been tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers during the next birthday when more marine crops and fish were preserved .
This is a reward I don &apos;t want to leave .
But it &apos;s not just about ocean creatures .
It &apos;s the way we look at our plate .
As a chef , I realized that the simplest thing I can do is to shrink the size of the proportions on my plate .
And then some things happened .
I made more money .
People started making supplies and lettuces because they knew that the main court alone is not going to get sick .
They took more time to deal with their meals , to deal with their meals .
In short , people got more than they expected if they got less protein .
They took more calories over the course of a diverse meal .
They got healthier . I made more revenue .
That &apos;s great .
With every plate , ecological respect was preserved , but at the same time , a growing mountain into account of human interests .
Another thing that we did was we extend the ways that we served — little silver fish , sardals , makrels , Sardins were common .
Even worse , shells , oysters , Venus muds , buntbarsch , Saibling — those were the known species .
We made the bats go towards more resilient , more repetitive opportunities .
That &apos;s what we should be afraid of .
That &apos;s what the Green List says .
But in the same way , we can actually start to restore our environment .
But what about the big predators , the fashion principles , the tuna on the green list that I talked about earlier ?
Now , if you have to , I have a recipe for you .
It works with almost any big fish in the ocean , here it comes .
Let &apos;s start with a 450 percent portion of a big fish .
Take a knife . Cut it in four pieces .
Put it on four plate .
If you look at these four plate vegetables and open up the very best bottle of burgunder you have , claim candles and celebrate it .
Enjoy the chance to have that .
Tell your friends and neighbors and repeat the whole thing once a year , maybe .
I expect a lot of food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I expect the production of ingredients , the preparation of the courts and the food of the meals , that all of this is part of human interests .
I was fortunate that my father was a fantastic chef .
And he taught me very early on that food is a privilege .
I remember the meals of my childhood .
It was sensible portions of protein served with lousy quantities of vegetables and small quantities of strength , usually rice .
That &apos;s the way I &apos;m going to eat today .
I &apos;m going to get bad when I go to steak houses .
I get sweat accidents of meat .
This is like a crater of protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But from all the horrible news that you &apos;re going to hear about the state of our ocean , and that you &apos;ve heard about , I have the unfortunate burden to give you probably the worst of all , and that is that all the time , she was right about her mother .
It &apos;s your vegetable .
It &apos;s pretty direct .
So what do we expect from a meal ?
Well , health , I expect conventional ingredients that are good for my body .
Joy , I want to make butter and salt and sexy things taste ingredients less than shack .
My family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that go into the knee before my life history .
But with society , we start at the very beginning .
There is no escape from the fact that everything we eat is a global impact .
So try your best to know what these impacts are , and then take the first step to minimize them .
We &apos;ve seen a picture of our blue planet , our World Bank .
But it &apos;s more than just a preservation for our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the unit that we call food .
So if we all take what we need , then we can start sharing the rest , we can start to celebrate , we can start to give back .
We need to enjoy vegetables .
We need to expose small portions to the seafood .
And we need to save food .
Thank you .

Hi . I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world who makes buildings out of paper , like this cardboard tube . This is my first exhibition I used paper tubes .
In 1986 , long before you started talking about ecology and environmental problems , I started testing paper tubes to build buildings .
It &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than I expected to do and make waterproof , and as an industrial tool , also to make it profitable .
Then I built a temporary construction in 1990 .
This is the first made of paper temporary buildings .
There are 330 tubes with a diameter of 55 centimeters , and only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 inches , 12 feet .
As you can see in this photograph , it &apos;s the toilet in it .
If the toilet paper is out , you can tear something off the wall . ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s very practical .
2000 was a big expo in Germany .
I was asked to design a building , because the issue of expo was environmental problems .
I was selected to build a pavilion of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
My goal was not to make the building .
My goal was to reuse or recycle my building , because every country builds pavilions , and so after half a year , a lot of industrial waste .
The building was recycled later .
That was the goal of my design .
Then I was fortunate to win the competition for building the second Centre Pompidou , in France , in the city of Metz .
I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but because I was so poor , I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to take my students to Paris to build our office at Centre Pompidou in Paris .
So we brought paper tubes and pieces of wood to build a 30-foot offices .
We stayed there six years without paying rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had a big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , even my friends had to buy a ticket to meet me .
That was the problem .
Then we finished Centre Pompidou in Metz .
Now it &apos;s a very popular museum ; I created a big building site for the government .
But then I was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we work not for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , contractors .
They have money and power .
These things are invisible .
So we &apos;re commissioned to make them visible by creating monumental architecture .
This is our profession , historically it was , and even now it is .
So I was very disappointed that we don &apos;t work for society , even though there are so many people who have lost their homes by natural disasters .
But I have to say that this is no longer about natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes don &apos;t kill people , crashing buildings kill people .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
Then people need temporary shelters , but there are no architects working there because we &apos;re too busy working for privileged people .
I thought that as architects , we could also be involved in building temporary shelters .
We can do better than that .
So I started working in disaster areas .
The big disaster in 1994 in Rwanda , Africa .
The population groups of Hutu and Tutsi fought .
Over two million people have become refugees .
I was surprised to see the emergency announcement , refugee camps , organized by the U.N.
People are so poor , and they freeze , with ceiling in the rainy season , and in the United Nations , they were provided housing only with a plastic plane , and the refugees had to cut down trees .
More than two million people were dying of trees .
And so deforestation emerged in a big scale , an environmental problem .
That &apos;s why aluminum tubes were ready , aluminum baking .
Very expensive , they get thrown out for money , and then the trees are cut again .
I proposed my idea of improving the situation using recycled paper tubes because they &apos;re so cheap and strong , and my budget per unit was only 50 U.S. dollars .
We built 50 units as a control test for consistency , humidity , termites , etc .
And then the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in Kobe in Japan .
Almost 7,000 people were killed , and the city , like the Nagata , was burning after the earthquake .
I found that many Vietnamese refugees had suffered and gathered in a Catholic Church — the building was completely destroyed .
So I went there and I proposed to the priest , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church from paper tubes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , are you crazy ?
After the fire you want to do that ? &quot; &quot; He didn &apos;t trust me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started to pat for Kobe , and I met with the advent of the Vietnamese .
They lived like this , with armed plastic planners in the park .
I proposed to rebuild . And I created capital .
I built some paper tubes for them , so that students could easily build and be easily rebuilt , I used as a foundation for beers .
I got into the beer company Kirin because the company Asahi made red bags at the time , and that doesn &apos;t fit in the color of the paper tubes .
The farm support is very important .
I remember we were expecting beer in the beers of plastic , but they came empty . ( Laughter ) I remember how disappointing this was .
In the summer , I built more than 50 units of the housing .
Finally , the priest trust me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can do that if you raise the money and bring the students to build . &quot; &quot; Five weeks later , we spent the church rebuilding .
It should stay there for three years , but actually it turned out to be 10 years because people loved it .
Then there was a big earthquake in Taiwan , and we proposed to sticking these church , so we set them down and sent them down to be built by volunteers .
She stayed in Taiwan , and she &apos;s still there as permanent church .
So this building became a permanent building .
So I wonder , what is a permanent and what a temporary building ?
Even a building from paper can be permanent , as long as people love it .
Even a building from concrete can be very temporary if that &apos;s what money is done .
After the great earthquake in Turkey 1999 , I went there to build shelters from materials in the ground .
In 2001 , I set up in West indigenous housing .
After the Sumatra-praise and tsunami in 2004 in Sri Lanka , I rebuilt fishing villages .
In 2008 , Chengdu in the Chinese Province of Sichuan killed nearly 70,000 people , especially many schools were destroyed as a result of corruption in housing and building entrepreneurs .
I was asked to build a temporary church .
My Japanese students worked with Chinese students .
In a month , we finished nine classrooms , more than 500 square meters .
This is still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , in L &apos;Aquila , there was a huge earthquake .
This is a very interesting photograph : the former prime minister of Berlusconi and Japan earlier Prime Minister , Mr. Aso — because every year we have to change to a new prime minister .
They were very affordable and enabled my model .
My proposal was a big building , a temporary musician , because L &apos;Aquila is very well known for music , and all concert halls were destroyed so that musicians went on .
I proposed to the mayor to build a temporary concert hall .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can do that if you can take the money for that too . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Berlusconi brought the G8 Summit to the city , our former prime minister came , and they helped us collect the money from the Japanese government , I got half a million dollars to build this temporary concert hall .
In 2010 , there was a huge earthquake in Haiti . It was impossible to fly there , so I flew to Santo Domingo next door , and drove six hours to Haiti to build 50 units of the Santo Domingo in the emergency room from paperwork tubes .
This happened two years ago in Northern Japan .
After earthquakes and tsunami , people had to be evacuated and collected in large spaces like sports halls .
Look at this , there &apos;s no private sector .
People suffer mentally and physically .
With the students as volunteers , we went there and built out of paper tubes , individual departments , simple shelters with a scaffolding of tubes and hanging out .
The administrators of some of these institutions did not want us to do that because then it would be harder for them to control people .
But this is really needed .
There &apos;s not enough flat space to build like this .
Look at this . Even the government is building temporary buildings so bad , so dense , so dense , because there &apos;s no plague room that &apos;s laying water — so I thought about building building buildings that are multistory because there &apos;s not enough land and that &apos;s not habitable .
So I suggested this to the mayor while I was building departments .
Finally , I met a very friendly mayor in the village of Onagawa in Miyagi .
He asked me to build on baseball fields three story buildings .
And I used fragrance containers and students helping build furniture to make it habitable , all equivalent to the government budget , the area that the house takes in is the same , but it &apos;s much more comfortable .
A lot of people want to stay here forever .
It was very pleased to hear that .
Now I work in New Zealand in Christchurch .
About 20 days before the earthquake in Japan , there was a huge earthquake where many Japanese students also came around and destroyed the most important cathedral of the launch , and the real sign of Christchurch was completely destroyed .
They asked me to come and build a temporary cathedral .
This is still in construction .
I also want to continue building monuments that are loved by the people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
What &apos;s going on in the mind of this baby ?
If you asked people 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have answered that this baby was unlogical , egocentric — that it could not take a view of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , the development science of this picture has completely disrupted .
So , in a sense , we believe this baby is thinking like the most brilliant scientists .
Let me just give you an example .
One of the things that this baby could think about , what could be going on in his head is that it &apos;s trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the head of the other baby .
And finally , one of the most difficult things for all of us is to figure out what other people think and feel .
And perhaps most difficult of all is to realize that what other people think and feel is not exactly what we think and feel .
Anyone who tracks politics can be witnessed how hard it is for certain people .
We wanted to know if babies and small children can understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is , how could we ask them ?
Ultimately , babies can &apos;t speak , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what he thinks , you get a beautiful stream of consciousness over Poney and birthday stage and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them this question ?
Well , it turns out that the secret is called broccoli .
What we did — Betty Rapacholi , one of my students , and I — we gave babies two dishes with food : a bowl of raw broccoli , and a bowl of empty gold fisheries .
Now , all the babies , even those in Berkley , like the crabs , but not the raw broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then Betty used a little bit of the two boots .
And I did as though it tasted her , or not .
So she did half the way she liked the crabs and not the broccoli — like a baby or any other normal person .
But at the other half , she tried a little broccoli , and she said , &quot; &quot; Mmm , broccoli .
I tried the broccoli . Mmm . &quot; &quot; And then she tried a little bit of the crater , and she said , &quot; &quot; Ffui , Igitt , crater .
I tried the crabs . Pfui , Igitt . &quot; &quot; So she was acting like she wanted exactly the opposite of what the baby was taste .
We did this with 15- and 18-month babies .
And then she just extended her hand and said , &quot; Can you give me a little bit of it ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her what tasted or what tasted her ?
And the remarkable thing was that the 18-month-month-month-month-month-month-long babies could walk and talk to them , gave them the crabs when they liked them , but they gave the broccoli if they tasted it .
And on the other hand , the 15-month babies stared at them for a long time , as if they liked broccoli , as if they couldn &apos;t understand it .
But after they stared for a long time , they just gave you the crabs they thought everybody had to like them .
So there are two really remarkable things here .
The first is that these 18-month babies have already found this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And they also felt that they should do things to help other people get what they wanted .
But more striking , though , is that the fact that 15-month babies didn &apos;t do that , suggests that these 18-month babies had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months after their first 15 months of life .
So kids know and learn more than we could have ever thought .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies of the last 20 years that actually shows this .
But the question you might ask is , why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short period of time ?
I mean , at the end of the day when we look at babies on the surface , they seem pretty useless to us .
And in fact , they &apos;re completely useless in many ways , because we have to invest so much time and energy in order to maintain them in life .
But when we turn to evolution to answer the mystery of why we spend so much time looking at useless babies , it turns out there &apos;s actually an answer .
When we look at the many , many different species of animals , not only do we primates , but other mammals , birds , even mammals , including germinals like kangaroo and bats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between the height of childhood of a species and the size of their brains compared to their bodies , and how smart and flexible they are .
And a kind of paradise for this idea is the birds up there .
On the one hand , there &apos;s a cigarette crow .
And crabs and other crabs , cows , seaweed and so on , are incredibly smart birds .
In some ways , they &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees .
And this is a bird on the front page of Science that learned how to feed a food tool .
On the other hand , we have our friend , our home .
And chickens , ducks , geese and truthahes are basically as dumb as beans .
They &apos;re very , very good at picking grains , and nothing else is particularly good .
Now , it turns out that the babies , the babies , the baby &apos;s cigarette cabinets , the cows .
They depend on their mothers who give them worms for two years in their little open coins , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Whereas the chickens are ripe within a few months .
So the childhood is the reason that crutches end up on the cover of science , and the chickens in the soup .
So it &apos;s a relationship between a long childhood and knowledge and learning .
What an explanation could we have for that ?
Now , some animals , like the chickens , seem to be very good at only one thing in particular .
So they seem to be best at picking up baskets in an environment .
Other creatures , like the crutches , can &apos;t do anything very well , but extremely good at learning the laws of different environments .
And of course , we are people at the very end of this distribution , like the crutches .
We have bigger brains compared to our bodies , with large distances to the other animals .
We &apos;re smarter , flexible , we can learn more , we survive in different environments , we migrated to defeat the world and even flew into space .
And our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies of any other species .
My son is 22 .
( Laughter ) And until they &apos;re 23 , we still put these worms in these little open coins .
All right , why do we see that connection ?
Now , one idea is that this strategy , this learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy to continue in the world , but it has a great disadvantage .
And this one big disadvantage is that until you actually learn all this , you will be helpless .
So you don &apos;t want to see the predator washing up on you and say , &quot; A tailer or maybe a spear could help . What would be better ? &quot;
You want to know all of this before the predators actually show up .
And evolution seems to have solved this problem with a kind of working force .
The idea is that we all have this breakfast , where we &apos;re totally protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we need to do is learn .
And then , as adults , we can take all these things that we learned as babies and children and send them to work to do things out in the world .
So one way to think about it is that babies and small children are like the research and development department of human species .
They &apos;re the protective idealists who just go out into the world , learn and have good ideals , and we are the production and marketing department .
We need to take all these ideas that we learned when we were kids and actually implement them .
Another way of thinking would be to look at babies and children not as incomplete adults , but in a different stage of development , but in the same species — in something like caterpillars and butterflies — just that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies flying around in the garden and digging around , and we &apos;re the caterpillars that are slowly moving towards our narrow , growing path .
If that &apos;s true , if babies are determined to learn — and this evolutionary history would say that children are there for learning , if they &apos;re determined for it — we might expect them to have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , a baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But in fact , real computers are getting much better .
And there was a revolution in our understanding of machine learning .
And everything is dependent on the ideas of this man , Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
And what Bayes did essentially was to show a mathematical way , using probability theory to characterize how scientists explore the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that seems to be possible and start with it .
They start with it and test it against measurement .
The finding gives them a difference in changing the hypothesis .
Then they test this new hypothesis , and so on and so on .
And Bayes showed a mathematical way of doing that .
And this mathematics is at the center of the best machine learning programs that we have today .
And about 10 years ago , I claimed that babies would do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on behind these beautiful brown eyes , I &apos;m going to think about it like this .
This is Reverend Bayes Notizbook .
I think these babies are actually doing complicated calulations with related probabilities that correct them to figure out how the world works .
Well , it may be even more demanding to prove that .
Because ultimately , even if you ask adults about statistics , these are extremely stupid .
So how are kids going to make statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we called licket detector .
This is a box that glows and plays music when you put the right things on them .
And with this very simple machine , my lab and other dozens of studies have done showing how good babies are when it comes to learning more about the world .
Let me just mention one study that we did with Tumar Kushner , my students .
If I were to show you this detector , you would probably think you could activate it by putting a block on the detector .
But this detector works in a slightly strange way .
Because if you move a block above the detector , something you would never get to at the beginning , the detector will automatically activate in two out of three cases .
Whereas the detector , if you do the probability and put the block on it , activates only in two out of six cases .
So the unlikely hypothesis has more evidence .
It looks like moving forward and moving is a more effective strategy than the other .
So what we did was we gave four-year-old this pattern in the Native Americans , and we asked them to make the detector work .
And really , the four-year-old used the clues to move the object above the detector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first is , again , remember , these are four-year-old .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they hire these rather complicated calulations that give them an related probability level .
And the other interesting thing is they used this clue to get an idea of a hypothesis about the world that you probably wouldn &apos;t start with .
And in studies that we &apos;ve just done in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve shown that four-year-olds are actually better at making unlikely hypotheses than adults , if we ask them the same task .
So in these circumstances , the kids use statistics to figure out how the world works , but eventually scientists do experiments , and we wanted to see if children do experiments .
When kids experiment , we call it &quot; &quot; into everything &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; And recently , there was a bunch of interesting studies that showed that this is actually a kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s a lab from Cristine Legare .
Cristine used our lightning detector .
And she showed kids that the yellow ones could make it work and the red ones didn &apos;t , and then showed them an anomaly .
And you &apos;ll see that the little boy will go through five hypotheses in the time of two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : How about that ?
Same as the other side .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , his first hypothesis was just dropped .
( Laughter ) Boy : This has illuminated , this hasn &apos;t .
AG : Okay , he raised his experimental notebook .
Boy : What makes this light up here ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will know that term of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because it has to be like this , and it has to be like this .
AG : Okay , second hypothesis .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG : This is his next idea .
He asked the experimentator to do that , to try and put it on the other side .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Boy : Oh , the light just lights up there , not here .
Oh , the soil of this box has electricity in it , and this one doesn &apos;t have electricity .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It lights up .
So if you put four on it .
So you put four on it to light it up and put two on those to light it up .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now this is particularly — this is a particularly loving and reverted little boy , but what Cristine discovered is actually quite typical .
If you look at how kids play , if you ask them to explain something to you , they actually do a series of experiments .
It &apos;s actually quite typical of four-year-olds .
Now , what is it like to be a creature like this ?
How is it to be one of these great butterflies that can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
Now let &apos;s go back to these psychologists and philosophers , many of them have said that babies and little children are hardly aware of when they &apos;re aware of themselves .
And I think that &apos;s exactly the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of themselves than we adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about the awareness of adults .
And the attention and awareness of adults looks kind of like a shame .
So for adults , we decide whether something is relevant or important , whether we should pay attention .
Our awareness of this thing becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else becomes dark .
And we even know something about the way our brain does that .
So what happens when we pay attention to something is that the prefrontal cortex , which is actually the leading part of our brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain much more flexible , more malleable , more adaptive , and it activates activity in the rest of our brain .
So we have a very focused , fueled kind of attention .
If we look at babies and little children , we see something very different .
I think babies and little kids seem to have a lateral of consciousness than a pillar of consciousness .
So babies and little kids are bad at focusing on a smaller choice .
But they &apos;re very good at getting a lot of information from a lot of different sources at the same time .
And if you actually look inside their brains , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are very good at producing learning and plastic , and the hijacked parts haven &apos;t come into play yet .
So if we say babies and small children can be bad at attention , we actually think they &apos;re bad at not being aware .
So they &apos;re bad at solving from all the interesting things that might tell them something and focus only on the important thing .
And that &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness that we might expect from these butterflies designed to learn .
Now , if we want to think about a way to make a picture of a baby &apos;s mind as an adult , I think we &apos;re best thinking about cases where we &apos;ve been brought to a new situation where we &apos;ve never been before — if we fall in love with somebody else , or when we &apos;re in a unknown city for the first time .
And then it contracts not our consciousness , but it expands so that these three days in Paris seem to be much more intense of consciousness and experience than all the months in which we were a transformative speaker at home , at teacher conferences , in conferences .
And by the way , this coffee , this beautiful coffee that you drowned down , mimics the effect of this baby neurotransmitter .
So what is it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like you &apos;re in love with , and for the first time in Paris , and you &apos;ve drowned three Espressi .
( Laughter ) So life is fantastic , but it tends to wake up at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Ever , it &apos;s good to be an adult .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
We can blow things like our snoughts and cross the road alone .
And it makes sense that we &apos;re very struggling to get babies to think like adults .
But if we want to be like these butterflies , locked up and open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , at least sometimes , we should get adults to think more like children .

I want to tell you the story of how it came to me that I became the HIV / AIDS activist .
And this is the name of my campaign , the SINGO campaign .
In November 2003 , I was invited to founding Nelson Mandelas 4664 Foundation . This is his HIV / AIDS Foundation .
And 4664 is the number Mandela carried when he was sitting in Robben Island in jail .
And here I am with Youssou N &apos;Dour on the stage , where I was humbling .
The next day , all artists were invited to meet Mandela in Robben Island , where he held a conference in front of the global press , and he was standing before his former prison cell .
That &apos;s where you can see the grid of the window .
It was an event for all of us , of a pretty big stretch .
At that moment , Mandela announced the World pressures that virtually a genocide is happening in his country , that in the rainbow nation , after the end of apartheid , thousands die every day , and that the victims are the most vulnerable of all , which is women and children .
That made a huge impression to me , because I &apos;m a woman , and I &apos;m a mother , and I didn &apos;t realize that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was just looking at women like this .
And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s one thing I have to talk about .
That I need to serve . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been involved in every single 4664 event that I could participate in , and held press conferences , gave interviews , talked about it , using my platform as a musician for my commitment to Mandela to the enormous , incredible work he &apos;d done .
Everybody in the world respects Nelson Mandela . Everybody adored Nelson Mandela .
But do they all know what &apos;s happening in South Africa right now , in his country , the country with the most frequent cases of transmission of the virus ?
I think if I go out in the street now and tell people what &apos;s going on , they would be shocked .
A few years later , I was very fortunate to meet Zackie Achmat , the founder of the Treatment Action campaign , an incredible fighter and activist .
I met him at a 4664 event .
He carried a shirt like this that I arrived .
This is a tool . It says that I &apos;m more solid with people carrying the HIV virus , people living with HIV .
And in a way , because of the stigma , I say , if I wear this shirt , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about it .
It doesn &apos;t have to be secret . &quot; &quot; I became a member of the Treatment Action campaign , and I &apos;m very proud that I &apos;m a member of this incredible organization .
It &apos;s a grassroots campaign , where 80 percent of members are women , most of them are HIV-positive .
They work in place .
They have a huge impact on the people who live immediately with the consequences of the virus .
They have education programs .
They bring the problems of stigma to the surface .
What they do is quite extraordinary .
And yes , my SINGO campaign has supported the Treatment Action campaign by trying to educate consciousness and trying to raise resources as well .
Many of the donations I &apos;ve been able to raise have been campaigned directly into the Treatment Action campaign and the incredible work that she &apos;s doing and continue to run in South Africa .
So this is my SINGO campaign .
The SINGO campaign basically consists of me and about three or four wonderful people helping support me .
In the last two and a half years , I &apos;ve traveled all over the world , and I &apos;ve been in about 12 different countries .
Here I am in Oslo , Norway , a nice , fine check , singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to the donor .
In Johannesburg , I got the opportunity to join a mainly white South African middle class audience who came to the tears at the end because I used film clips that really go to the heart , the full degree of these terrible tragedies that would take place that people would like to delay because they &apos;re tired , and they really don &apos;t know the solution to it .
Aaron Motsoaledi , the Minister of Health , went to this concert , and I had the opportunity to meet him , and he gave his mandatory commitment that he was going to try to make a change that was absolutely necessary .
This is in Scottish parliament .
Then I became a ambassador for Scotland and HIV .
And I shared my experience with them and tried to reform a conscious mind .
And again , in Edinburg , with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir that I just adore .
And it &apos;s children like these , many of whom live in orphanages , because their family is affected by the AIDS virus .
Here I &apos;m sitting in New York with Michel Sidibe , and he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
And I feel very honored that Michel invited me just a few months ago to become UNAIDS ambassador .
And in that way , I strengthen my platform and I expand my efficiency price .
The message that UNAIDS is spreading around the world right now is that we want to be able to eliminate the transmission of mother to child to child by 2015 .
This is a very ambitious goal , but we believe that it can be done with political will .
It &apos;s to create .
And here I am with a pregnant woman who is HIV-positive , and we smile , we &apos;re both smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that this young woman is going to receive a treatment for her life so she can take care of the baby she &apos;s born .
And her baby will get PMTCT , which means that this baby can be born without infecting the virus .
Well , that &apos;s precautionary to the beginning of life .
It &apos;s an opportunity for intervention against AIDS pandemic .
Well , I &apos;d like to end by telling you the short story of Avelile .
This is Avelile . She &apos;s with me wherever I go .
I tell everyone their story , because she stands for one million of HIV / AIDS orphans .
Aveliles &apos;s mother had the HIV virus . She died of a disease associated with AIDS .
Avelile had the virus . She was born with the virus .
And here she is at the age of seven , not harder than a one-year-old baby .
At that point of her life , her AIDS disease had completely broken out , and she had a pneumonia .
We met them in a hospital at the East Coast , and we spent a whole afternoon with her — a beating child .
The doctors and nurses were great .
They put them on a very specific nutrient diet , and they treated them with great care .
And when we left the hospital , we didn &apos;t know — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So it was obvious — it was a very emotional encounter , and this direct experience , this one child , you know , this one story , called strongly afterward feelings for us .
Five months later , we went to South Africa again to see Avelile again .
And I get — the hair on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hair on my arms .
You &apos;re up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you now .
This is the change that had happened .
Isn &apos;t that extraordinary ?
( Applause ) These are actually applauding the doctors and nurses of the hospital who cared for Avela .
And I suppose you appreciate that kind of change .
So I would say that you , everyone here in the audience , if you believe that every mother and child in the world have the right to access to good nutrition and good medical care , and if you believe that all governments in the world — especially those in sub-Saharan Africa — the Millennium bill , especially number five and six , you would want to please stand up .
I think it &apos;s appropriate if I say that &apos;s almost all in the room .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago , in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers moved a large object secretly through the driverless landscape .
With the object , they hoped to be able to attract everybody &apos;s attention by being the first to conquer space .
The rocket was huge .
And at their top , a silver art center was installed , which contained two radio devices .
On October 4th , 1957 , they started their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time , &quot; &quot; We are in the term of creating a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
In the old days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus were fortunate to join the globe .
Now we are fortunate to unlock space .
And those in the future are supposed to envy us about our joy in equal measures . &quot; &quot; They look outwards from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary film that was just finished .
He tells the story of Sputnik and the story of what happened as a consequence of America .
And days after the launch , Sputnik was an amazing thing of curiosity .
As a human-made moon that could be seen by average citizens , he inspired to awe and pride that humanity had finally sent an object to space .
But only three days later , on a day they called Roter Monday , the media and politicians told us — and we believed it — that Sputnik was evidence that our enemy had beaten us , in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs by using their Sputnik rocket as trusses .
All the world was upside down .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three big shocks that America met — according to historians at the same level as Pearl Harbor or or 9 / 11 .
It was a trigger for the discrepancy in the evolution of rockets .
It wiped out a weather race .
It triggered the competition into space .
Within a year , Congress funded extensive breeding expenses so that we came from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
But the response to Sputnik went much further than a weather race .
For example , some people here remember this one day in June 1958 , the national civil defense unit where several tens of millions of people went underground in 78 cities .
Or the opinion polls that showed that seven out of 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war was happening , and that at least 50 percent of our population would die .
But Sputnik also made wonderful changes .
For example , some people in this room , thanks to Sputnik , will have gone to school with a scholarship .
The progression of engineering , mathematics and science — education in total — boomed .
And Vint Cerf suggests that Sputnik has immediately led to ARPA and the Internet , and of course NASA .
My documentation shows how a free society can be put in panic that know how to use the media .
But it also shows how we can turn something that looks like a bad situation in something that , in total , was very good for America .
&quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; is soon published .
Finally , I &apos;d like to use the moment and thank one of my investors : TED Veteran Jay Walker .
And I want to thank you all .

Thank you , Chris .

Good morning . Magic is a great way to be ahead of the reality curve , to make this possible today , what science can really be done tomorrow .
So as a cybermaster , I connect the elements of illusion with science to give us a sense of how future technologies could be experienced .
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look through these glasses and you see the world expanded by data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of strangers that meet you on the street .
This is now my illusionary glasses .
It &apos;s a little bit bigger . It &apos;s a prototype .
And if you look through it , you can take a look at the thought of a cyber illusionist .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a map , any card .
Like this . I &apos;m going to mark it now so we can see it when we see it again .
All right . A very marked sign .
Now we put them back in the pile , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s start .
( Music ) Voice : System ready . Just picture .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who are non-cardiac , there &apos;s four different colors : heart , clubs , diamonds and spades .
The cards are among the oldest symbols , and they have been interpreted in very different ways .
Now , some say that the four colors are the four seasons .
There &apos;s spring , summer , fall and ... Voice : My favorite season is winter . MT : My own .
winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change when heat becomes cold , water becomes snow , and everything disappears .
There are 13 cards in every color . ( Music ) Voice : Every card represents a stage of 13 monthycles .
MT : So here &apos;s Ebbe over here , there &apos;s tide over here , and in the middle there &apos;s the moon .
Voice : The moon is one of the strongest symbols of magic .
MT : There are two colors in the cardboard .
There &apos;s the color in red , and the color is black , they stand for the shifting day to night .
Voice : Marco , I didn &apos;t know you can do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that 52 cards are in a cardboard , just like there are 52 weeks a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you put all the dots in a cardboard , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days of a year , the number of days between every birthday .
Do you want something . ( Typing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t get it or it doesn &apos;t go into fulfillment .
MT : Well , actually , on my sixth birthday , I got my first card card card , and since that day , I &apos;ve traveled around the world to clean , for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are the ? MT : Ah , rubber . Look .
Get up .
Joker : Hey . MT : Are you ready for your performance ?
Joker : Ready ! MT : show me what you got on it .
Joker : I present my finger . MT : Ah . Pass up .
Joker : Hey , hey , hey , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today I &apos;m meeting for a very different audience .
I &apos;m meeting for you .
Voice : You recognized the card . MT : Well , sometimes people ask me , &quot; How did you become a wizard ? Did you have just done work ? &quot;
Of course not ! You have to practice around the clock .
I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
Rand around the clock is a little bit exaggerated , but you need practice . Now , some people will say magic must be the work of a evil , supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Hey .
So , I &apos;m just saying , no .
In German , it actually means &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Magic is not so strong , but I have to warn you , if you ever play with someone like this , don &apos;t play money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good sheet .
The odds for a leaf are at 4.165 to one .
MT : Yeah , but I think my hand is better than all probability .
Voice : Your birthday congratulations went to fulfill . MT : And that actually brings me to the last and most important map of all : the map with the very famous sign .
And unlike anything we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not . Voice : recognized a map .
Digital MT : This is the real map without any question .
MT : Bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years . I &apos;ve been at TED I .
And the third is slightly less obvious .
Did they all agree ? No , not quite .
I buy this . I have so much money .
I have so much money , it will take forever .
I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state in Bihar , and I remember when I was six years old to come home and find a little car full of sweet candy outside our front door .
My brother and I fell over it , and my father came home .
He was out of anger , and we cried when the car was pulled away with the half-finished candy from us .
Later I understood why my father was so upset .
The candy was a bribe present by a contractor who hoped to get a government assignment from my father .
My father ran the street in Bihar , and he had said , despite races and threats of corruption .
It was a lonely fight , because Bihar was also the most corrupt state of India , officials were preparing themselves instead of serving the poor who couldn &apos;t sue their suffering if their children had no food or schooling .
I experienced this in my own suffering when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
Back then , I traveled from village to village , and I remember one day when I was very hungry , exhausted , and the nearby , in the bright heat under a tree , and I invited one of the poorest men of this village to his hut , and I was kind of friendly .
Later on , I realized that what I ate was equivalent to two daycare rations of his whole family .
Through this really generous gift , I questioned the meaning of my life and changed it .
I decided to help others .
Later , I worked for the World Bank , who struggled to fight this poverty by transferring aid from the rich to the poor countries .
My first job focused on Uganda , where I led with the Minister of Finance reform negotiations to give access to our credit .
But after we paid the loans , I found myself on a journey to Uganda , building schools without textbooks and no teachers , new clinics without drugs , and the poor again without speech or return .
It was just like Bihar again .
Bihar is the difficulty of development : elite poverty in the middle of corruption .
Worldwide , 1.3 billion people live on less than 1.25 dollars a day , and the work that I was doing in Uganda shows how to deal with these problems traditionally . This process has been practiced since 1944 when the winner of the Second World War , 500 founding fathers and a founding mother , in New Hampshire , United States , came together to call the Bretton Woods , to the World Bank as well .
This traditional process of development has three elements : first , the resource centrifuge of rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south , with regulation .
Secondly , the transfer of conductive development institutions with just a little transparency on what was funded or what results are achieved .
Third , the commitment in developing countries led a small elite group of government members with very little contact with the population , the affordable of aid .
Today , these elements become more open , through dramatic twists in the global environment .
Openness knowledge , open government , are the three big changes that are changing now , and that makes the stronger hope that the problems I saw in Uganda and Bihar can be solved .
The first big change is open knowledge .
Today , developing countries don &apos;t just accept solutions that they &apos;re proposed by the United States , Europe or the World Bank .
They get inspiration , hope and practical know-how from successful emerging economies in the south .
They want to know how China was able to release 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how the Oportunity program in Mexico has improved schooling and nutrition of millions of children .
This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge , which is not only flowing north to south , but also from south to south , and even from south to north , as Mexico &apos;s Oportunity program just inspired the city of New York .
And with the opening north-south transfers opening up also the developmental institutions that run these transfers .
The second key piece is open assistance .
Recently , the World Bank provided their databases to the public , there were 8,000 economies and social indictors from 200 countries and 50 years , and they launched a global crowdsourcing competition for innovative apps using this data .
Development institutions today also enable the public examination of projects .
For example , geoMapping . In this map of Kenya , red dots show red dots through funding schools , and the darker the green is , the more children don &apos;t go to school .
This simple surveillance shows that donors in places where the least kids go to school have not funded schools , and this raises new questions : Does aid get the most they need ?
In this way , the World Bank now uses geomapping for 30,000 projects in 143 countries and donors use this shared platform to map all their projects .
This is a source of transparency and accountability for help .
And so for the third , and I think the most important thing is the most important change in development , open government , and governments are opening up , as the population picks up and demands accountability .
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare-movement in India , mobile phones and social media are not only used for the requirement of political accountability , but also for the accountability in aid .
Those governments of their population ?
Some governments in Africa and Eastern Europe , for example , make their budgets available publicly .
But it &apos;s a big difference whether a budget is available or easy to look at .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) As you can see , it &apos;s not really available or deliberable for a normal citizen trying to understand government spending .
To address this problem , governments are using new tools that are graphic to the budgets and make them so comprehensible .
On this map of Moldava , green districts that spend a lot of money on schools , but good educational outcomes come , and red shows the opposite .
Tools like this are made out of a shelf full of unparalleled documents of accessible , comprehensible visualization , and what &apos;s exciting is that with that openness , citizens have new ways of giving feedback and putting themselves in .
Today , parents and students in the Philippines can give feedback on a website in real time , on Checkmyschool.org or SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are in school , problems like those in Uganda and Bihar .
And the government responded to that , for example , when the government was reported on this website , that 800 students were in danger because repairs were brought to the standstill for corruption , the Ministry of Education in the Philippines quickly joined action .
The best thing about this innovation is that it &apos;s passed from south to south , from Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldawien and beyond .
In Dar it Salaam , Tanzania , even an armed community could use these tools to express their wishes .
This is what the map of Tandal looked like in August 2011 , but in a few weeks , students with mobile phones and open-source platform could make a map that shows the whole infrastructure of their community .
The exciting thing about this is that citizens can give feedback , where health care centers or water sites don &apos;t work , as you can see here on the red dots , which together represent a graphic visualization of the collective voice of the poor .
Today even Bihar is changing and opens up with a committed government that makes decisions transparent and responds to the needs of the poor .
But in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or serving the poor , and this is a real challenge for the people who want to change the system .
These are lonely fighters , like my father and many , many others , and it &apos;s a major task for developing these lonely warriors to help unify their forces so that they can do the tasks together .
For example , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government have gone to coalition to unlock transparent contracts in the oil sector , and as a result , reformers in Parliament are now beginning to cover dubiosis contracts .
So these examples are hoping that there are new ways of tackling the problems that I saw in Uganda , and my father was faced in Bihar .
Two years ago , April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was late at night , and he was in the process of writing a six-page public officially relevant legislation about corruption in a street building project .
Even though he &apos;s not a lawyer , the next day he defended this case himself in court . He won the process , but later that evening , he fell and died .
He fought until the end , passionately convinced that the fight against corruption and poverty is not just the honesty of government officials , but also the clash of citizens , so that their concerns will be heard .
These were the two maximum of his life and the journey that he started on reflected the changing landscape of development .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m very excited that the World Bank has proposed these new directions , a distinct difference to my work in Uganda from 20 years ago .
We need to open development radically so that knowledge spreads in all directions and inspire those who are doing development work in order to make aid transparent , reverseable and effective , so that governments can open and empowered and empowered with reformers within the government .
We need to accelerate these changes .
If we do that , the collective voices of the poor will also be heard in Bihar and also in Uganda and beyond .
In schools , there will be teachers &apos; books and teachers for the kids .
We will see that these children also have a real opportunity to overcome their poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Babies don &apos;t die anymore .
Now take a minute .
Turn to your seat .
Give yourself a hand .
Please give each other the hand .
Learn to know .
They actually look very nice .
But what if I tell you that the person who just gave you the hand didn &apos;t wash your hands when he got off the toilet ? ( Laughter ) Suddenly they all don &apos;t look so nice , right ?
Very disgusting , you agree with me .
Why ? Is there no soap ?
But , actually , there are soap .
In 90 percent of households in India , and in 94 percent of households in Kenya , there are soap .
Even in the walls where the least soap is like Ethiopia , we &apos;re at 50 percent .
So what is it about ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
What is it that Mayank , the little boy from India , doesn &apos;t wash hands ?
In Mayanks &apos;s family , soap is used for the bathroom , soap is used for laundry wash , soap is used for business flags .
They don &apos;t give it to him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
Where did you learn to wash your hands ?
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
However , we mimic what others do , and local , cultural norms can change our behavior , and at this point the private sector comes in .
The belief in that , linked to the size of Unilever , it continues to allow us to talk to these mothers about walks with soap and hygiene .
Think about it : merchants spend all their time moving from one brand to another .
The budget isn &apos;t always enough .
In short , the funders of public health are actually dependent on soap companies to keep track of walks with soap .
It &apos;s a profit for the private sector because we &apos;re attracting new generations of traders to the future .
But the biggest benefit is the particularly endangered people .
Most of the discussions are still running online .
I &apos;m from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
Our family conversation at dinner was always about social justice .
I studied in Europe &apos;s leading college for health .
We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
Some of you may remember hearing business growth and saving lives in a certain way in the same sentence , but only by business growth , we can expand our activity .
And without talking about it alone , we can &apos;t make the change we need .
Last week , my team and I visited mothers who have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn child .
I &apos;m a mother . I can &apos;t imagine anything more overwhelming and more painful .
It comes from Myanmar .
She has the most sound smile , the smile that gives you life when you get a second chance .
Her son Myo is her second chance .
It &apos;s the greatest invention of public health .
I hope you &apos;ll do it for us and make pockets part of your everyday life and all of our lives and help kids like Myo experience their fifth birthday .
Thank you very much .

These are simple objects : ears , keys , tribes , glasses .
The victims of the genocide in Bosnia were wearing them on their last trip .
They were usually told that they were going to be eradicated against prisoners .
It &apos;s probably the biggest ever discovered .
During the fourth year conflict that Bosnia destroyed in the early &apos; 90s , about 30,000 citizens , largely civilians who were likely to be murdered , and more than 100,000 died during the battle negotiations .
The International Criminal Court hired a series of judgments about crime against humanity and genocide .
It &apos;s also about killing the genocide .
It &apos;s also about the destruction of property , its cultural heritage , and ultimately the notion that they never existed .
The genocide is not just about killing , but about denial of identity .
There are always traces — there &apos;s no perfect crime .
There are always restaurant of the deceased that regret their fragile bodies and our selective and blurry memory of them .
Not a single body should remain unborn or universal .
Thousands of objects are done in white pumps , just like the ones you see at CSI .
These objects are deployed properly to visual identification of victims , but you also use them as a very valuable evidence in the ongoing war trial .
Over-living people are asked to identify these objects personally , but manual breakthrough is very difficult , an inefficient and painful process .
A lot of them are destroyed if you believe it or not , or just wrapped in , from the eyes , from the point of view .
I decided a few years ago to photograph each and every one of the exhumed pieces to create a visual archive that could easily see the survivors .
As a storyteller , I want to give back to the community a little bit .
I don &apos;t just want to create a conscious mind .
In this case , someone could recognize these objects , or at least stay in the photos as permanent , valuable and accurate reminder of what &apos;s happened .
Photography is about empathy and the familiarity of these objects guarantees empathy .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a forensic tool , sort of , and the result is a photography that almost equates a document .
In their whole simplicity , objects are the last witness of the identity of the victims , the last permanent memory that these people have ever existed .

So I want to show you something that I &apos;ve been working on .
Some things I learned during these 30-day challenges .
This was part of a challenge that I took a picture for a month .
I was never that adventurous .
He &apos;s terrible .
In fact , they &apos;re a huge fun .

Hi . So I want to introduce some work that &apos;s going on today .
Since we &apos;re still working on the projects , we &apos;re still working on a field of intuition and mystery .
So I &apos;m going to try to describe some impressions that we &apos;re looking for in each of these works .
The first piece is called the Imperial Monochromes .
A viewer kind of goes in the room , and puts a glimpse of blackboards in a chaotic composition on the wall .
Within seconds , as if the blackers had noticed the presence of the viewer , they seem to panic and arrange in strict symmetry .
( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
We wanted to see how little change needed to get from one state to another .
This also reminded us of two very different images .
One is the 15th century old days , and the other one is about 100 years ago , Malewitch &apos;s abstract compositions .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a video now .
That &apos;s about that much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
So the viewer enters the space , and they immediately turn out .
And after a while , as the viewer continues in the room , the billboards somehow become immune to the presence of the viewer and become neglected and self-confident , until they notice some kind of presence in space or motion , they immediately turn out .
( Laughter ) So here it seems like it &apos;s the viewer who somehow initiates the sense of order between the billboards , but it might also be the opposite that the billboards are so trapped in their pre-programmed behavior , that they sort of pushing the viewer into the role of a tyranny .
So this instability in the movement is very well mimics the shaky pixels of how it &apos;s observed by a camera .
Here I &apos;m going to show you two more tandemic clips .
One was taken with a solid camera , and the other one was taken with a camera .
And you immediately see the wacky character of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective view .
So we just took the camera away and we transmitted this movement to the board .
And here &apos;s the video .
The other hand , you have to imagine , it &apos;s not there now .
But we &apos;re kind of trying to create a reticent gestulation , like there &apos;s a little person with extended arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
It &apos;s sort of comparable to the degree of load , to be in the service of the observer , and to present the viewer to this piece of paper very graceful .
The next work is a lure .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about the size of me .
It has a disconnected body , two arms and a very large head-like antenna , and its only purpose is to attract attention to itself .
So when a viewer passes , it &apos;s kind of wobbling around and forth and moving his arms more desperately , the closer the person gets .
Here &apos;s the first case .
You see the two movements integrated , and the object is busy embody this expression of despair .
Once it has the attention of the person , it &apos;s no longer interested in it , and it &apos;s looking for the next person .
It looks like it &apos;s from a mass production , like it &apos;s from a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
Since we &apos;re always working out of a very personal space , we like the kind of consumer aesthetic that object somehow strangers and gives us a little distance , at least in the appearance .
And so for us , it &apos;s a kind of finite creature that &apos;s trying to distract you from the things that really need your attention , but it could also be a character that needs a lot of help .
The next piece is an object that is also a kind of music instrument .
In the form of an amphitheater , which is the size of a audience , how it &apos;s perceived by someone from the stage .
In the audience , 96 little characters are sitting there .
A mechanism enables them to clap from their own free will .
So if the viewer is in front of the audience , there &apos;s a reaction .
It could be anything , from a very poor applause of individual members from the audience or even very loud ovations .
So I think we really see an audience as a separate object or an autonomous organism that has just sort of a musical quality , an instrument .
So the viewer can play it by creating quite complex and diverse , differentiated musical or acoustic patterns , but he can &apos;t really influence the audience in a certain way of reaction .
So it involves feelings of judgment and charity and awkwardness .
It also brings in a formidable and compelling quality .
So here , if you can see it , we &apos;re very excited about the image of how the heads split up to form the two hands .
So here &apos;s a little visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are emanating each other to sort of make sense , through the duality and the tension .
And here &apos;s a prototype .
We can &apos;t wait to fall out of 996 .
Okay , that &apos;s the last piece . It &apos;s called Framerunner .
It comes out of the concept of a window .
This is actually a window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s composed of three different thickness , wooden sections combined .
So we used the same kind of fine-tuning structure to make our own frame or a grid that can then hang in space and be viewed by two sides .
This grid is occupied by a tribe of small characters .
They were also created in three different sizes to indicate a kind of perspective or landscape on a single level .
Each of these characters can also walk backwards and hide backwards in the layers and hide behind two adjacent racks .
So unlike this very narrow grid , we wanted to give these characters a very strange and laptops similar quality , like a puppeteer holding them and animate them physically on the path .
So we like the idea that the characters sort of shut down along the way , as if they &apos;re self-forgotten and uncompromised and deliberate until they discover a kind of movement of the observer and then hide behind the next wall .
So for us , this piece shows its own paradox .
These characters are sort of trapped inside this very rigid grid , which is like jail , but also like a landing , because it allows them to forget and be naive and careful and very untouched by the outside world .
All of these qualities of real life , which I &apos;m talking about , are translated into a very special technical configuration , and we were very happy that we could work with the ETH Zurich .
So , it &apos;s really very small .
See , it could fit into my palm .
So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio .
( Applause )
This is what the year would look like .
But then something funny happened .
Anyway , today I &apos;m such a blog guy .
It means everything is good until this happens .
In the animal kingdom , it works prime .
There &apos;s overlap .
I call it the dark playground .
Guess who got weak ?
It &apos;s not nice , but at the end it works .
Right ? I think all of you are procrastinators .
A box for every week in a 90 years of life .
We should all take a long , intense look at the calendar .
We need to be aware of the soft-reward monkey .
That &apos;s a challenge for all of us .
Pretty soon .
Thank you .
That day , a unit of American and Afghan troops were on the way through a part of Afghanistan to protect a group of government officials ; Afghan officials who were traveling to a meeting with some of the villagers .
The unit got in a backyard , and it was surrounded by three pages , and in addition to many other things , Captain Swenson was honored to go under the grasp to save wounds and touch dead .
Among the scaffold was a sergeant that he would take with a camera to a rescue helicopter .
And the remarkable thing about that day was that one of the rescue doctors , incidentally , had a helmet camera and filmed the whole scene .
You put it in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bent over him and gives him a kiss before he turns around to save others .
When I saw this , I wondered , where are these people coming from ?
What is that ? It has to be very deep feelings when you &apos;re willing to do something like this .
In the military , people who are willing to sacrifice themselves to the well-being of others .
In the economy , we reward people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we win .
So we do it the other way around .
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; They all gave the same answer : &quot; Because they would have done it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s that deep sense of trust and cooperation .
Trust and cooperation are very important here .
The problem with terms like trust and cooperation is : it &apos;s emotion and no instructions .
I can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; trust me , &quot; &quot; and you trust me .
I can &apos;t have two people to cooperate , and they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s a feeling .
Where does that feeling come from ?
If we go back 50,000 years , into the Paleolithic , in the early days of Homo sapiens , we see a world full of dangers , and all of these forces were all about killing us .
It wasn &apos;t personal .
Whether it was the weather , the lack of resources , or a saber-toothed , all of these things were working on the shortcut of our lifespan .
So we evolved to a social animal by living together and working in a safe circle , as I call it , in a tribe that we felt deeply comfortable .
And if we felt secure under our same , trust and cooperation was the natural response .
That has benefits .
It means that I can sleep at night and trust someone from my tribe holding vigil .
It &apos;s a bad survival system .
It could be the rise and the avenue of the economy ; the uncertainty of the stock market .
Or a new technology that will obsolete your business model .
It could be competitors that sometimes try to cheat you .
It &apos;s hard to push out of business , but at least hard work to stop your growth and steal your business .
The man was crippled because he didn &apos;t think of the order .
So I said something .
&quot; &quot; Why do you treat us like livestock ?
Why don &apos;t you treat us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; Her answer was this .
&quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t believe in the rules , I could get difficulty or lose my job . &quot; &quot; So she said she didn &apos;t feel safe . She said that .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we like to fly with Southwest Airlines is not necessarily that they hire better people .
If conditions don &apos;t match , we have to spend our time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that automatically weakens the organization .
The best analogy for what a good leader is for me the parents .
What do you want from good parents ? What do they do ?
The child &apos;s opportunities , education and , if you need to give discipline , so that it grows up and reaches more than we &apos;ve designed it for us .
Big leaders want this .
They give people opportunities , education and engineering ; they enhance confidence , trial and failures so that they can achieve more than we could have imagined for ourselves .
Charlie Kim , the head of a company called Next Jump , a tech company in New York City , argued as this : &quot; If it went up in her family , have you ever asked to leave her child ? &quot;
You would never do that .
So why do we think about disclosure in our companies ?
Charlie developed a concept of lifelong engagement .
If you work at Next Jump , you won &apos;t be fired for performance problems .
In fact , someone who has problems will be mentorized and gets support , as we do for our child when it comes out of school with three .
That &apos;s why so many people have such anger in the belly , on some of these banking boards with their disproportionate salaries and boni .
It &apos;s not on the numbers .
It &apos;s because basic leadership principles .
Knowing that they willingly sacrificed their people or even sacrificed their people to protect their interests .
Would anyone be offended if you gave Ghandi a $ 150 million bonus ?
What about a 250-million-dollar bond for mother Teresa ?
Would you have a problem with it ? It &apos;s not at all .
Big leaders would never be people .
They sacrifice numbers .
They would sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
For such a business , it &apos;s a big deal . They couldn &apos;t afford their labor .
It was about 10 million dollars to save , and like many companies today , the incident came together and talked about disclosure .
But Bob refused .
Because mobs are not the sizable size .
Bobs scale is the size of the heart , and it &apos;s much harder to rationalize the size of the heart .
So they designed a vacation program .
All the staff , from the secretary to the boss , had to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
They could take him when they wanted , and they didn &apos;t have to take him on a piece .
But the way Bob presented this idea was critical .
They were saving 20 million dollars , and most of all , it was unexpected because people felt safe and protected by leadership as a natural response to trust and cooperation .
And very spontaneously and unexpectedly , people were negotiating with each other .
Leave is a decision , not a rage .
They &apos;re rulers , and we do what they say , because they gave them authority about us , but we wouldn &apos;t follow them .
I used to hear the story of some Marine soldiers who ran out , and as the marine used to eat , the officer was the last one , and he left his men eat first and when they finished , there was no food left for him .
When they were back in the field , his men took him a little bit of their food , so he could eat . That &apos;s what happens in these cases .
We call them leaders because they go ahead .
Because they are the first to take the risk .
They give their blood , their sweat and their tears to realize the vision of their leaders , and when you ask them , &quot; &quot; Why should you do that ?
Why would you sacrifice blood , sweat and tears for this person ? &quot; &quot; the answer is always the same : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
Wouldn &apos;t that be an organization that we all would like to work in ?
Thank you . ( Applause )

I grew up in a small village called Motetema , on the border between Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
The water and power supply are just as unpredictable as the weather . When I was 17 , I was in winter , relaxing with some friends .
The sun in Limpopo is very hot in the winter .
When we were sunny , my best friend next to me said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t anyone do anything you can just do on the skin so you don &apos;t have to wash up anymore ? &quot; &quot; I sat there and I said , &quot; &quot; Hey , I would buy this . &quot; &quot; I went home and I did some terrifying statistics .
More than 2.5 billion people in the world have no adequate access to fresh water and sanitation .
450 million in Africa , five million in South Africa .
Different diseases are thriving in this environment , and the most threatening of these are the tragedy .
A trachome is an eye infection caused by Dreck in the eye , repetitive infection can lead to permanent blindness .
This disease makes eight million people blind every year , and the bad thing about this is , in order to avoid a tragedy infection , you just have to wash your face . No drugs , no pills or syringes .
After seeing the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Even if I do it not just for me to wash myself anymore , at least to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) With my favorite Ross , a Nokia cell phone — I had no laptop or the Internet , except for 20 bucks — ( Laughter ) — pro-stinking Internet cafe — and I was doing some sort of research on the Web , and I was writing a bunch of computer mining .
It looked like the recipe for the secret KFC geeworm .
I said to myself , &quot; &quot; We have the formula .
Now we need to put them in practice .
Four years later , after writing a 40-page business plan and my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent holder in the country . ( &quot; &quot; Nie more wash ! &quot; &quot; ) I can &apos;t add anything to that . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first lotion to replace the bathroom .
You put them on the skin and you save your wash with it .
( Laughter ) After trying to do it in school with listed financial resources , I went to college , met a few people and put it in practice . The product is ready and ready for distribution . In fact , it &apos;s already offered to sale .
We &apos;ve drawn some lessons from commercialization and from the power of DryBath .
We learned that poor communities don &apos;t buy very large amounts .
It &apos;s on demand . Somebody who lives in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a package of cigarettes , but a single cigarette every day , although it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged DryBath in these novel packets .
You cut them and you press them .
The cool thing is , one of these tiles is putting a bath on five edge .
After we created this model , we learned a lot about how to implement the product .
We noticed that even wealthy suburban children want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
We found that , on average , you could save 80 million liters of water for every time these kids leave a bathroom , children on the country would save two hours every day , two hours more time for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a child .
After seeing these global impacts , we restricted to our values : cleanliness and convenience .
DryBath is convenience for the rich and rescue for the poor .
With the product already implemented into practice , we &apos;re about to be about to sell it to a global corporation for the distribution of the retail , and I &apos;ve now got a question to the audience . On the Scottish highways of Limpopo , with 50 Rand , with 50 bucks per week , I &apos;ve developed a replacement for the bathroom .
What &apos;s holding you back ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not finished yet .
During that time , I learned something else . Last year , Google described me as one of the smartest young talents in the world , and last year Google described me as one of the smartest young talents in the world .
I &apos;m also the most successful young entrepreneur in the world . The first African with this award , and what amazes me is that I did this because I just didn &apos;t want to wash .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I succeeded in school . I expected a lot of me , and I was happy to take the student life that was made of presentations , parties and directors .
Within it , I was deeply unhappy , uncertainty and completely frightened — I was afraid of other people , before the future , before failure and from the void that I felt inside .
I just left a seminar when it started , and I summed up in front of me , fumbling around my pocket , as I had done it hundreds of times , when I suddenly heard a voice that sounded quiet , &quot; She &apos;s coming out of the room . &quot;
I looked around , and no one was there , but the clarity and displacement of the commentary was misunderstood .
&quot; She opens the door . &quot;
It was the beginning . The voice was upset .
And that voice lasted for days , for weeks , and on and on , she told everything I did in the third person .
&quot; She goes to a talk . &quot;
She was neutral , untouched , and , in fact , after a while , she was very commonly cameroonically and profoundly , although I realized that her quiet look sometimes rushes and occasionally reflected my own unseen feelings .
For example , if I was angry , and I had to hide it , which I often did , because I was practiced in hiding what I felt , then the voice was disappointed .
A subtle conversation process had begun . The implication that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices , but I heard them meant something couldn &apos;t agree with me .
I spent some time telling the college doctor about it .
And to be honest , I was distorted for interest and help , and I started telling him about my strange comment .
For example , I was a member of a student TV show who radiated news on the campus , and at a terminal who was very moved , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Doctor , but I have to go .
At that point , the events began to overcome .
One introduction to the hospital followed , the first of many who diagnosed schizophrenia was next , and then what was the worst was a toxic , comfortable feeling of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about me and my prospects .
But after I was encouraged to see the voice not as an experience , but as a symptom , my fear and my resistance against her .
This meant essentially taking an aggressive posture across my own mind , a kind of mental civil war , and this led to the fact that the number of voices increased and became more hostile and endangered .
Do you see the glass of water ?
Practically , a vicious cycle came out of fear , mastery , mistrust and misunderstanding , and this was a struggle where I felt madless and unable to build any kind of peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , the situation had dramatically deteriorated .
By now , I had the whole wacky repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesian visions , bizarre , hard-looking delusions .
If I look back at the grimmer and despair of these years , it seems to me today when someone had died and someone else was saved .
A broken and indigenous person started this journey , but the new person was a survivor and ended up growing up to the person I was determined to .
A lot of people have injured me in my life , and I remember all of them , but the memories are becoming pad and weak compared to the people that helped me .
I believe that Eleanor can overcome that .
You know , sometimes it snows in May , but the summer is still coming . &quot; &quot; 14 minutes is not enough time to call all the good and generous people who fought with me or for me and expected me when I came back from this cold , lonely place .
First of all , it &apos;s very hard to believe , and it &apos;s not just because the voices seemed so hostile and threatening , so a critical step was to learn how to separate the metaphorical meaning of what I had been interpreting as a literal truth .
For example , when the voices were threatened to attack my home , I learned to interpret this as my own sense of anxiety and uncertainty in the world rather than a current objective danger .
At first , I would have believed them .
I remember one night in front of my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I felt was a real threat through the voices .
After the motto , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t join me .
I have a plastic bill , right ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
And with that knowledge , I ended up collecting my broken self , and every fragment was embedded in a different voice , and I slowly took my medications back and returned to psychiatry just this time on the other side .
I &apos;m very proud now to be part of &quot; &quot; Intervoice , &quot; &quot; the organizational unit of the International Hearing Voice Movement , one of the work by Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher &apos;s inspiring initiative that classifies mood as a survival strategy , a healthy response to unhealthy circumstances , not an anomatic symptom of schizophrenia , which has to be explored , but a complex experience .
This social form is not only possible ; it &apos;s evolving .
To paraphrase Chavez : When social change begins , it cannot be stopped .
You can &apos;t humiliate a person who feels pride .
You can &apos;t suppress people who are no longer afraid .
Over the past 20 years , the Hearing Voice Movement has set up voice networks in 26 countries on five continents working together to promote dignity , solidarity and communications of people with mental disorders to create a new language and a practice of hope that in their core is an innocent faith in the strength of the individual .
As Peter Levine said , the human animal is a unique creature with the instinctive ability to heal and with the mental ability to use this innate ability .
In the meantime , for members of a society , there is no greater honor or no greater privilege than to enable this healing process for someone to be able to enlist , to help share the burden of suffering and to maintain hope for genesis .
We are unique . We are imperable .
What we carry in us can never be truly colonized , deformed or erased .
The light never explores .
As a wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what others told you about you .
Tell about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

I &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
Is it photography at all ?
Because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
And yet , my interest in photography when I received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
I combined it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the process was much more in planning .
And if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So for me , photography seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time .
I thought everybody could .
So I wanted to create something different , something that the process begins when the trigger is pressed .
Images like this : a building along a much more experienced road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And yet , it stops a realistic level .
Or photos like this — dark and colorful , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
When I say reality , I mean photography reality .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really catch , but I always want to make it look like they could have , in a photograph .
Pictures where you have to think for a brief moment to find out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than really a moment .
But what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it about the details or the colors ?
Is it about light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional space .
It &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I think of them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
We have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
But in a certain way , combined with each other , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , as though it might exist .
But at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
So we reject our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process in combining photos .
It &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
So the things that make a picture look realistic , I think these are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
So I would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic outcome .
As you can see , these are not three special images .
But combined , they can create something special like this .
So the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
Secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
And these two pictures fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same altitude and the same lighting species .
Third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images begin and end by connecting them seamlessly .
Make it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
So by comparing color , contrast and brightness to the edges of each image , you add photographic masks , like rocks , displays and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo , even though a picture can essentially contain hundreds of levels .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) You might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part is manipulated .
But this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
I personally feel that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into compromise with the ideas in your head .
But it requires a lot of planning .
And when I had this idea in winter , I knew I needed several months to plan it to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish had been taken on an air trip .
The bank is from a different place .
The underwater part comes from a quarry .
And yes , I actually colored the house up on the island in red to make it look Swedish .
So to achieve a realistic outcome , it &apos;s from me looking out on planning .
I always start with a sketch , an idea .
And then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
And here &apos;s each piece that &apos;s very well planned .
And when you do good images , the result can be quite beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
So it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that replicates us is our imagination .
Thank you very much .

It &apos;s this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
It &apos;s reported that WikiLeaks , your child , has published more secret documents over the last few years than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
Can that really be possible ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , can that really be possible ?
It &apos;s frightening — right ? — that the media in the world are doing such a bad job , that a small group of activists is able to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the world &apos;s press combined .
CA : How does that work ?
How can people publish documents on you ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
JA : Well , there are — as far as we know — classic Whistleblower , and we have a series of ways for them to give us information .
We &apos;re only using the state-of-the-art encryption methods to hunt things through the Internet so that traces are wired , we &apos;re conducting them through legal rooms like Sweden and Belgia to use their legal protections .
We get information through mail , encrypted or uncoded , or not , we check it out like any regular regulatory organization , we sort of — what &apos;s sometimes not that easy to do when we talk about vast database of information — publish it , and then we defend ourselves against the inevitable and political attacks .
CA : So then you &apos;re struggling to ensure that the documents are legitimate , but in fact , you almost never know the identity of the source .
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s true . We only get that very rarely , and if we find out at some point , we &apos;ll destroy that information as quickly as possible .
( Phone ring ) That &apos;s a crap .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the CIA is asking for the code for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take an example .
This is something you did a few years ago .
If we could show the document ...
This was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you did and what happened ?
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s the Kroll Report .
This was an intelligence exports , which was commissioned by the Kenyan government , after the elections in 2004 .
In 2004 , Kenya was governed by Daniel arap Moi for over 18 years .
He was a gentle dictator in Kenya .
And when Kibaki came to power — through a coalition of forces trying to fight up with the corruption in Kenya — they put this report on , they spent more than two million pounds on this and another report .
And then he kept the government for himself and used it as a political printing against Moi , who was the richest man — still the richest man in Kenya .
It &apos;s the holy grail in Kenyan journalism .
I &apos;ve been there in 2007 , and we &apos;ve managed to get that in my hands just before elections — the national elections on December 28th .
When we published the report , we did it three days after the new president , Kibaki decided to commit to the man he wanted to confront . Daniel arap Moi . So this report became a burden for President Kibaki .
CA : And to cut the story short — the report was known in Kenya , not by official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually impacted the choice .
JA : Yes . This was the cover of the Guardian , and it was then printed in all countries around Kenya , in the Tanzanian and South African press .
And so it came in from outside .
And so after a few days , the Kenyan press felt safe to report this .
And it walked 20 days behind the Kenyan television , shifted the voting vote by 10 percent , after a Kenyan secret report , which changed the outcome of choice .
CA : Wow , so then your leak really changed the world ?
Yeah . Jepp .
( Applause ) CA : Here — we &apos;re going to show you a short clip of the Bagdad air-attack video .
The video itself is longer . But here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — this is hefty material , I should warn you .
Funk : ... just shit , once you &apos;ve got it , just stop .
I can see , oh , here &apos;s four Humvees , uh , outside ...
All right . OK . I firm .
Say modest if you have them . Let &apos;s shoot .
Put them all in Brand .
Go get fire out !
( Machine fire ) Other shooting . White shooting . ( Machine fire ) White shooting .
Hotel — Bushmaster two-six , Bushmaster two-six .
Movement , immediately !
So , we &apos;ve just caught all eight individuals .
Yeah , we see two birds &#91; Helicopter &#93; , and we keep shooting .
Roger , I have them .
Two-six , here &apos;s two-six , we &apos;re mobile .
Ups , sorry . What is it about ?
Damn Kyle . All right , haha . Hab it .
CA : What was the impact of this ?
JA : The implications of the people working on this were substantial .
We sent two people to Bagdad at the end to study the story further .
Because this is just the first of three attacks that happened in this place .
CA : Ah , I mean , 11 people died on this attack , right and two of them worked at Reuters ?
JA : Right , two models of Reuters , two little children were killed .
In total , between 18 and 26 people were killed .
CA : And when that was published , it caused external outrage .
What was the key part of this thing that actually caused this outrage , what do you think ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people see the huge difference in forces .
There they have people who are relaxed to go down the street and then have an Apache helicopter in a kilometer away , firing with a 30-millimeter canon each other — looking for a reason — and killing people who want to save the vulnerable .
And there were two journalists involved that were clearly not insurgent , because that &apos;s their full-time job .
CA : And there &apos;s this U.S. intelligence agency , Bradley Manning , who was arrested , and he was commissioned , in a crash , that he agreed to play this video with 280,000 secret telegraph of the U.S. Embassy .
So , does he have ?
JA : Well , we agreed to preserve the telegrams .
He was claimed , about five days ago , for buying 150,000 telegrams and published 50 .
Now , in the spring , we published a telegram of the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik , but it doesn &apos;t necessarily have to do with it .
I mean , I was a well-known visitor of this message .
CA : Well , if you had received thousands of diplomatic telegrams of the message ...
JA : Then we &apos;d have published it . ( CA : Would you have ? ) JA : Yes . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because this is the true state of things to contribute to Arab governments , the real human rights clogging of those governments .
If you look at free telegrams , you find such material there .
CA : Let &apos;s talk a little bit more general about it .
So , what is your philosophy actually ?
Why is it really the leather of secret information ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s the question of what information in the world matters , what kind of information can lead to reforms .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So information that comes from organizations with economic efforts , and that &apos;s a really good signal , that if this information comes to light , it might be a good thing to do , because the organizations that they know best , that they know very well , the work that they do is to hide it .
And that &apos;s what we found in practice , and that &apos;s the story of journalism .
CA : But are there also risks , either for those who are affected or even for society as a whole , where the leaks in fact have negative , unintended consequences ?
JA : Not that we &apos;d seen it in what we published .
I mean , we have a politics of harm reduction .
We have a way of talking about news that has any personal — person-identifying information .
But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records at the doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret , but we have to do with informants that come to us with a real and good motivation .
CA : Well , they &apos;re very motivated .
And what would you say to , for example , the parents of someone — their son serves in the U.S. military , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you published something , somebody had a good reason .
It shows a U.S. soldier making fun of dying people .
That makes the impression — made the impression of millions of people in the world that U.S. soldiers are unhuman .
But are they not . Not my son . How can you dare it ? &quot; &quot; What would you say about it ?
JA : Yeah , we hear that very often .
But remember , the people in Bagdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they experience every day .
It will change people &apos;s perception and opinions that pay for everything , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So then you &apos;ve found a way to bring light into these , as you know , these dark secrets of companies and governments .
Light is good .
But is there not irony in the fact that if you can shine the light , you yourself , personally , have to make a secret for your sources ?
JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have WikiLeaks-dissidents until now .
We have no sources that dissidents are against other sources .
If that happened , it would be a tricky situation for us , but we probably operate in a way that people are morally committed to doing our mission and not to mess it .
CA : I would be interested , just because of what we &apos;ve heard about — I &apos;m curious about the opinion of the TED audience .
There are certainly some views about WikiLeaks and Julian .
You know , hero — hero of the people — that brings this important light .
Danish stages .
Who here has the heroic vision ?
Who thinks it &apos;s a dangerous listener ?
JA : So really . There must be some .
CA : They like you , Julian , they like you .
We need to harder . Let &apos;s show another example .
This is something you haven &apos;t left behind , but I think you &apos;re doing this for TED .
This is an amazing story that happened just recently , right ?
What is it about ?
JA : That &apos;s an example of what we do every day .
By the end of last year — in November last year — there was a series of explosions of oil sources in Albania like the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , not quite that big .
And we got a report — sort of a technical analysis of what happened there — that said that actually security people had some rivallegic , competing oil companies apparently parked there trucks and then chased in the air .
And part of the Albanian government was involved in this , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing in the technical record at all , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t identify it because we didn &apos;t know who written it and knew what it was about .
So we were a bit skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil company that wanted to play up the subject .
Based on this , we published it and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material looks good , it seems OK , but we can &apos;t check it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter just this week from the company that wrote this because they want to make the source sensitive — ( Laughter ) and they say , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to find the source . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document are they talking about ?
Can they prove that they have the rights to this document ?
Does it really sound to them ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us a screen photograph with the author at Microsoft Word ID .
Yes .
( Applause ) That happens relatively often .
This is sort of one of our ways of identifying — identifying what material that is , we &apos;re trying to get these people to write us letters .
CA : Yeah . Do you have internal information from BP ?
JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but right now we &apos;re starting to collect donations and repair organizational organisms .
So our publication rate has been more minimal in the last few months , as we rework our systems in the back for the phenomenal public interest that we face .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any growing , newly founded organization , we &apos;re a little bit overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we get a lot of whistleblowers of very high couples , but we don &apos;t have enough people to actually edit and check that information .
CA : So then that &apos;s your main passage , basically journalist volunteers and / or funding journalist salaries ?
JA : Yeah , exactly and trustworthy people .
We are an organization that has a hard time growing fast because of the kind of material that we have to do with , so we need to restructure it so that we can get people to deal with the issues of highest national security and then with less secure cases .
CA : All right , let &apos;s help you personally understand and how you got to this task .
I think you &apos;ve read that , as a child , you &apos;ve gone to 37 different schools .
Can that be true ?
JA : Well , my parents were in the film business , and then on the flight of a second , the combination of both ...
( Laughter ) CA : Well , a psychologist might say that this is a recipe for growing pursuit .
JA : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker in young years , and you got in touch with the authorities early on .
JA : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist activist in my youth .
I wrote a magazine , I got punished when I was a teenager .
So you need to be careful with the term hackers .
I mean , there &apos;s — there &apos;s a method you can use for different things .
Unfortunately , most of the time , she &apos;s used by the Russian mafia to help her grandmother pop the bank account .
So the term is no longer — not as nice as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I &apos;m not sure you &apos;ve got the bankers from some other grandmothers , but what about your central values ?
Can you give us an idea of this and maybe call an event of your life that affected you at night ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure of this event .
But the values at the core : Well , empowered , generous people don &apos;t create victims ; they take care of victims .
And this is something from my father and something from other empowered , generous people that have given it in my life .
CA : capable , generous people don &apos;t create victims ; they care about sacrifices ?
JA : Yeah . And , you know , I &apos;m a champagne person , so I &apos;m not necessarily as strong as we &apos;re concerned about this , but in a way — there &apos;s a different way to deal with victims , which is to monitor perpetrators in their crimes .
And so that &apos;s one thing that &apos;s been in my character for a long time .
CA : So let &apos;s just tell you , in the last minute , this story : What happened in Iceland ?
You published something there , you had problems with a bank , and then the news service there was stopped to get the story .
Instead , they &apos;ve known your site .
That made you very prominent in Iceland . What happened then ?
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s a great case . Now , that &apos;s a great case .
Iceland had this financial crisis .
It was met by all countries on the hardest .
Her bank sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we publish this report in July last year .
And the national television was given a one-way five minutes before they wanted to send it . Like in a movie that &apos;s available on the desk and the news speaker said , &quot; There &apos;s never been . What are we doing now ? &quot;
Well , we just show instead the website , all the time , as fillers , and so we became very famous in Iceland , we went to Iceland and we talked about this thing .
And there was this feeling in society that this may never happen again , and as a result , with some Icelandic politicians and other international regulators , we &apos;ve put together a new package of legislation for Iceland so that it can become a kind of foreign access to the free press with the strongest journalist protection of the world with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
Iceland is a northern country , so it can , like Norway , plug in the system .
And just a month ago , this was all passed by the Icelandic parliament .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
If you think about the future , do you think it will be more a Big Brother that practices more control , more secrets , or are we watching Big Brother or will it go on both directions ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure where it &apos;s going to go .
I think there &apos;s enormous pressure to harmonize the laws of freedom of speech and transparency all over the world — within the European Union , between China and the United States .
Where is this going to go ? It &apos;s going to be easy to say .
That &apos;s why today &apos;s time is very interesting , because with just a little bit of effort , we can change it in one way or another .
CA : Well , it looks like I meet the nerve of the audience when I say Julian , being careful and all the power for you .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
&quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do / I &apos;m not going to go to your war room .
I &apos;m not going to borrow my soul or my bones of your warriors .
I &apos;m not going to dance to that drum impact .
I know the blow .
It &apos;s without life .
I also know the fur that you &apos;re chasing .
It was once alive , hunted , stolen , stretched .
I &apos;m not going to dance to your damaged war .
I &apos;m not going to knit for you , turn me , break .
I &apos;m not going to hate you or hate you .
I &apos;m not going to kill you .
Most of all , I &apos;m not going to die for you .
I &apos;m not going to talk about the murderers or about the suicide murder .
I &apos;m not going to be on your side or dance to the bombs just because everyone does .
Everybody can feel wrong .
Life is a right , no side or randomness .
I &apos;m not going to forget where I came from .
I &apos;m going to build my own drum .
My loved ones around me , and our song will be like dancing .
Our hum will be like drums .
I don &apos;t want to be played .
I &apos;m not going to borrow your drum beat or my name or my rhythm .
I &apos;m going to dance and resist and dance and not let go and dance .
This heartbeat is louder than death .
Your war room is not louder than that breath . Haaa .
What &apos;s going on , TED people ? I don &apos;t hear any of you .
( Applause ) A bunch of Pacific figures .
It was confused , stopping Pacific fists .
I figured it out .
I &apos;ve had a lot of wrong lately .
Like so many .
So I couldn &apos;t decide what to read today .
I prepared myself , of course .
That is , I prepared my outfit — ( Laughter ) — and I was prepared for different ways of trying to figure out who and whom I &apos;m in line .
The lighting does that .
She &apos;s preparing you . She gives you a goal .
So I &apos;m going to read you a poem that was just chosen .
But you have to sit around 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
Take it firmly in your arm now .
You don &apos;t need to name your name ; you can just hold it .
Do you have them ?
This poem is called &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; The whole sacred story was forbidden .
Unwritten books predicted the future , planning the past .
But my head reveals what seems limitless : the inventive violence of man .
Who is supposed to be ? Is it going to be ?
What boy will one day go underground ?
The death of our boys is shaking up .
We keep the dead in the ears .
We are traumatizing women , complicated .
You &apos;re beaten every day .
Prophets are made . Prophets are flattened .
With war and tooth , he emailed , healthy lemonade childhood .
All colors are broken , none of us are consistent .
Don &apos;t look after my shadow . I &apos;m wearing it in me .
I live circles of light and dark .
rhythm is half silence .
Now I know I &apos;ve never been one and not the other .
Disease , health , gentle violence .
I think now I &apos;ve never been in .
Before the shape , I was a storm , blind , instant — I still am .
Human beings were blind , malignant .
I never went in .
A girl dies before it rains .
Language can &apos;t mathematical me .
I do my experiences exponentially .
Everything is all .
A woman loses 15 , maybe 20 members of her family .
Another one loses six .
A woman loses her head .
Another one is searching in the rubble . One is feeding by waste .
One shoots her face . One shoots her husband .
One snows up .
One built a buckling .
It &apos;s a boundary .
One believes no longer that love ever achieves it .
One has never believed it .
Where do refugees go from ?
Mountains , taken down , put them where they don &apos;t want to come from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
Confronts with absence .
We believe in every single person or we don &apos;t mean anything .
My backbone is spiraling .
Leave goes to people or from them .
Back to the left geek bombs .
De facto landmines .
A jewelry couch .
They harvested tobacco .
They made bombs .
They made baby teeth .
We harvest palms , smoke .
We witnessed testimony , smoke .
Resolutions , smoke .
Save , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
breathe .
Don &apos;t feel what &apos;s exploded .
If you do , then you fear what &apos;s not exploded .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
During my time as a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world looked a bit crazy .
The population explosion wasn &apos;t stopped .
A global famine was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment , should destroy our lives .
The clean rain fell to our forests .
The desert expanded a mile or two a year .
The oil was scarce . And a nuclear winter should give us the rest .
None of them got true . ( Laughter ) And amazingly , you looked at what actually happened over my life , the average per capita income of an average person on the planet in computational , inflated , tripled .
Life expectancy has increased by 30 percent during my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two thirds .
The per capita food production has gone up by a third .
And this is all at a time when the population has doubled .
How did we do that — do you think it &apos;s good or bad ?
How did we do that ?
How did we become the only species that gets wealthier while it gets numerous ?
The size of the glue in this representation represents population numbers , and the level of the curve is the per capita GDP .
And I think in order to answer that question , you have to understand how people put their brains together and allow their ideas to hide and to hide , to encounter and to actually commit themselves .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we evolved to do things like this , and then create objects like this .
Both are real objects .
This is a 50,000-year-old fan arrow of Acheulée making him the Homo erectus .
The other one is obviously a computer mouse .
Both of them have exactly the same size and shape in a fresh way .
I tried to figure out what the bigger object is , but that &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit into the human hand .
Both of them are technical devices , and their resemblance is not that interesting .
It just shows that both of them were designed for the human hand .
I &apos;m more interested in the differences , because the left object was made for about a million years in unchanged shape — from a million and a half years ago , until half a million years ago .
Homo erectus made the same tool across 3,000 generations .
Of course , there were some adaptations , but at the time tools changed slower than the skeleton .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right has been obsolete after five years .
Another difference is that the object on the left was made out of a single substance .
The object on the right was made out of a mixture of different materials , silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
In addition , it was created from a mixture of different ideas , the idea of plastic making , the idea of laser technology , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;ve all been put together in this technology .
And that combination , this cumulative technology , fascinated me , because I think that &apos;s the secret , if you want to understand what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also a collection of ideas : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
They agreed .
How does evolution create this simulation , this combination of things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
If you have two different mutations in different creatures of an asexual species , a green and a red one , you have to be better than the other .
One is going to die so that the other one can survive .
But in sexual specifications , it &apos;s possible for an individual to acquire both mutations of different blinks .
Sex enables the individual to extract from the genetic innovations of the entire species .
It &apos;s not limited to its own blindness .
So what does the process that has the same effect on cultural evolution like sex on biological evolution ?
I think the answer is exchange , habit , one thing for another .
It &apos;s a unique human property .
No other animal does that .
You can teach them to practice a little bit of trading trade in the lab , and indeed there is a republic authenticity in other animals , but the exchange of an object against another object never happens .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No one has ever seen a dog that travels his bones in a fair way with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can put a culture without exchange .
It &apos;s like an asexual culture .
Chimpanzees , killer whales , creatures of this kind have a culture .
They teach each other their traditions that are passed from parents to offspring .
In this case , the chimps teach each other how to crack with stones .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , don &apos;t gather , never combine together , and the reason is that there &apos;s no sex in some way , there &apos;s no exchange of ideas .
Chimpanzee groups have different cultures in different groups .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange increase the standard of living ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you the story &apos;s stone conversion , despite the fact that he was moving to trade between countries .
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three for a stick .
Oz needs an hour to make a spear , and two for a stick .
So Oz is better at making spears and faustics than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and foustles .
But no , because you can see it this way : if Oz manufactures two spears and Adam had two Faustles , and then they dive , each of them saved an hour of work .
And the more they do that , the more the more it will be , because the more often they do it , the better Adam is to create faustics , and the better Oz is to make spears .
The profit from the trade-off is only going to get bigger .
And there &apos;s one of the beautiful sides of the exchange , which is actually giving the impulse to more specialization , which gives the impulse for more exchange , and so on .
Adam and Oz both fled for an hour .
It &apos;s wealth ; satisfying your own needs , saving time .
Ask yourself how long you would have to work for it if you had to reconcile yourself with an hour of light to read a book tonight .
Suppose you start at the beginning . Let &apos;s say they go out to the country .
They find a sheep . They kill it . They extract the fat out of it .
They make it out . They make a candle out of it , etc . , etc .
How long would you take it ? It &apos;s a pretty long time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of readers if you earn as much as a British today earns on average ?
The answer is about half a second .
In the old days , in 1950 , you had to work eight seconds to earn on average what you got so much light for .
That &apos;s what you &apos;ve achieved seven and a half seconds of prosperity since 1950 , because in this seven-and-a-half seconds you can do something different , or you can acquire a different commodity or service .
And earlier , in 1880 , you would have to work 15 minutes to acquire this amount of light from an average wage .
In the old days , in 1800 , you would have to work six hours to buy a candle that burns for an hour .
In other words , an average person with a average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
Think back to the picture of the fan arrow and the mouse and ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who made it and for whom ? &quot; &quot; The flag was made by someone for themselves .
It was self-care .
Today we call poverty .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Ten ? Hundreds ? About ?
You know , I think there were probably millions .
Because you also have to include the man who builds the coffee that was used for the man on the oil platform , which drilled after the oil , which was made of plastic , etc .
They all worked for me to make a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how societies work .
That &apos;s what we achieved as a species .
In earlier days , when you were rich , you had literally people working for you .
They got rich . They employed them .
Ludwig XIV. owned a lot of people working for him .
They made his silly outfits , like this . ( Laughter ) And they made his silly hairstyles or whatever .
He employed 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
But a recent tourist who was walking around in the palace of Versailles and looking at the images of Ludwig XIV. also employs 498 people to get their food at night .
They work in Bistros and Cafes and restaurants and businesses all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you for an hour a pre-generous time , which is probably better quality than Ludwig XIV. ever enjoyed .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved because we all work for each other .
We can specialize and exchange to increase our standard of living .
Well , you can also find other animals working for each other .
Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and they work for the workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , because it all happens within a colony .
They don &apos;t work across colonies for each other .
The reason is that there &apos;s a reproductive workforce .
That means they specialize in reproduction .
The queen alone is in charge .
We don &apos;t like that in our species .
The reproduction is something that we persist on to do it ourselves .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave the reproduction of the queen .
( Applause ) So since then , has there been this embarrassment ?
And how long does that go ? And what does that mean ?
Well , I think probably the oldest version of this is probably the seven-specific workforce .
But there is no evidence for that .
It just looks like we created the first work of men for women and women for men .
In all societies of hunter-gatherers today , you can see a workforce at the foraging sector , mostly between hunting men and gathering women .
It &apos;s not always that simple , but you can distinguish between specialized roles of men and women .
And the nice thing about this system is that both sides benefit from it .
The woman knows that , like here at the Hadzas — where women are digging roots and sharing them with men in exchange for meat — she knows that if she wants to have access to protein , she has to dig some roots in addition and exchange for meat .
And then she doesn &apos;t have to go to a beating hunting hunting and try to kill a warning leg .
And the man knows he doesn &apos;t have to dig roots .
He just has to make sure that if he kills a warning leg , one that &apos;s big enough to share .
And so both sides are increasing through gender-specific workforce , raising each other their standard of living .
When did it get ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do that .
They were highly cooperative species .
They were the highest intelligent species .
Their brains were ultimately bigger on average than yours and mine today in this room .
They were inventive . They prayed their dead .
They probably had a language , because we know that , just like us , had the FOXP2 gene that was discovered here in Oxford .
And it looks like they had obsessed linguistic skills .
They were great people . I don &apos;t want to insult Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no indication of a gender level of work .
There &apos;s no evidence that the women were collectors .
It looks like the women were facing the men as hunters .
And also , there &apos;s no evidence that there was an exchange among groups , because the objects that you find in the remains of Neanderthals , the tools they made are all made of materials in the region .
For example , in the Caucasus , there &apos;s a place where you find tools of the Neanderthals there .
They were all made of fires in the region .
In the same valley , there are remains of modern humans from about the same time , from 30,000 years ago , and some of these objects are made from local fires , but not only that — many of them are made of observation that comes from a very remote area .
And when people started to snap objects like this , it was a clue that there was an exchange between groups .
Commerce is 10 times older than agriculture .
People forget that . They think of trade as a modern phenomenon .
Except between groups have been happening for hundreds of thousands of years .
The earliest evidence of this occurred sometime 80 to 120 years ago in Africa , where you can see that observation and Jaspis and other things were retreating extension within Ethiopia .
You can also find shells — as a team here in Oxford found out — over 200 miles from the coast that came out of the Mediterranean at Algeria .
And that suggests that people had started with exchange among groups .
And that &apos;s going to lead to specialization .
How do you know that the movement over long distances of trade and not because of migration ?
Now , look at modern hunter-gatherers like the Aborigines who built the material for stone in a place called Mount Isa , in a stone break that belonged to the trunk of the Kalkadoon .
They do trade with their neighbors against things like the spines of skirts , and as a result of that , you find stone blocks in lots of parts of Australia .
Leaving great distances back , that &apos;s a sign of trade , not for migration .
What happens when you exclude people from exit , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
And the answer is that technological progress is not only slowed down , it &apos;s actually making a tutor .
One example of this is Tasmania .
When sea level rise 10,000 years ago and Tasmania became an island , not only did people gain lower progress than the people on the mainland , they even got a decline .
They gave up their ability to make tools and fishing tools and clothing , because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not paying enough to preserve these specialized skills needed to keep the technology they had .
The same thing happened when people here in the room were exposed to a lonely island .
How many things that are in your pockets could we make after 10,000 years ?
But in fireland , it was different — similar island , similar people .
The reason for that is that fireland from South America is separated from a much lower sea level , and over that marine road there was a trade contact over 10,000 years .
But the Tasmania were isolated .
Back to this picture . Don &apos;t just ask who made it and for whom , but who knows how it &apos;s made .
In the case of Faustity , the man who made it know how to make it .
But who knows how to make a computer program ?
No one . Actually no one .
No one on this planet knows how to make a computer program .
I mean , it &apos;s really serious .
The president of the computer company doesn &apos;t know .
He only knows how to run a company .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know , because she doesn &apos;t know how to drill after an oil source to extract the oil from the plastic , and so on .
We all know a little bit about it , but none of us know everything .
Now , of course , I have to quote from a famous article by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , which is , &quot; &quot; I , the pencil , &quot; &quot; where he described how a pencil was made , and that even nobody knows how to make a pencil , because the people who build it together don &apos;t know how to fix it , and they don &apos;t know how to cut trees , and they don &apos;t know all these things .
In human society , by exchange and specialization , we &apos;ve created the opportunity to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
Language is not the same .
In the middle of the language , we have to convey ideas so that we understand ourselves in one way .
But with technology , we can even do things beyond our ability .
We have grown up to an extraordinary degree of the ability of the human mind .
And this , by the way , is one of the reasons I &apos;m not interested in the discussion of IQs , which is whether some groups have higher IQ than other groups .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
Relative to a society is how good people communicate their ideas and how well they work together , not how smart their individuals are .
So we &apos;ve created something like a collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the exchange of ideas , the encounter and advocates of ideas , and that &apos;s where technological progress is written , gradually . piece by piece .
But also bad things happen .
And in the future , if we continue , of course , we will also experience terrible things .
There will be wars ; there will be economies ; there will be natural disasters .
Furable things will happen in this century . I &apos;m very sure .
But I &apos;m also because of the connections that people are coming in , and that &apos;s never been there before the possibility of ideas to meet and commit , and I &apos;m also sure that technology is continuing , and that &apos;s why the standards will continue to improve .
Because with the cloud , through black storage , through the emerging world that &apos;s standing on your head , where not only the elites , but anyone can have ideas and let them meet and commit , we will certainly speed up the innovation rate .
Thank you very much .

My name is Uldus .
I &apos;m a photographer from Russia .
I &apos;m also focusing on significant messages , aesthetics , beauty , imagery , something irony and props .
Today I &apos;m talking about my project called Desperate Romantics .
But this boy has dreams and goals that he makes to be accepted , because being different is not easy , not even in Russia .
The next picture is a metaphor .
This is Nikita , a Turkey in a bar in Sant Petersburg .
He often says , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t do me angry . &quot; &quot; Like Hulk in the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
He hides his sensitive and romantic side , because for Russian men , Romantik is uncool , but it &apos;s cool to surround with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
( Laughter ) For my projects , I sometimes take pictures and give them a new meaning , or rather than the temptation .
Sometimes I compare facial expressions and use word games : irony , Iron Man , ironing man .
( Laughter ) With the props , I &apos;m talking about social problems from my environment in Russia .
Interestingly , in Russia , most girls already have 18 or 19 of them , as soon as possible to marry .
We &apos;re learning as children that a yellow marriage is a paralyzed life , so most girls are doing everything to do good parties .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
I was in Russia as an old calf , and so I was a hopeless case .
So you see me with a Mexican Wrestler mask in a brown dress absolutely desperately in my garden .
But irony is the key again . In fact , I want to motivate girls to fight for their goals and dreams and to go against prejudice .
Be strong . Be ironic — it helps .
Be funny and bear some magic in the world .

My name is Awith .
18 months ago , I did something else at Google , and I was excited to do something with museums and art , and my CEO , who is today , gave me green light .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
There &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
I grew up in India .
I got a great education — I don &apos;t complain about it — but I didn &apos;t have access to many museums and those works of art .
So when I went to visit these museums , I started learning a lot .
And while I was working for Google , I was trying to make this vision — to make art accessible — to bring technology together .
We then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
I &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
So you just go to Google ArtProject.com.
You can look around in all these museums here .
There &apos;s Uffizi , the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
I even come to one of my favorite , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
You get in two ways — very simple .
Click , and wumm , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
You go around and you amuse .
You want to orient in the museum ?
Open the map , and jump with a click .
There you are , you want to go to the end of the whole .
Go ahead . Good fun .
Stay safe .
( Applause ) Thank you , but the best one is coming .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , Ernest worker of Pieter Breugel in the Met .
I see this sign .
If the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
This is now one of the images .
These are all metadata .
Those of you who are really interested in art can click on this — but I &apos;m going to take it away now .
This is one of the images that we &apos;ve stuck with what &apos;s called the Gigapixel technology .
For example , this image has about 10 billion pixels , I think .
And a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you now .
You can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
You see something funny here .
I love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
But then you really want to get into it .
And so I started playing around , and I realized there was something going on .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I went up close , and I noticed slowly that these kids actually beat something .
I did some research , I spoke to some people at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called Squail , where a guans are beaten at the holiday with a stick .
It was apparently popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
To go really close , you can go up to the cracks .
Just to give you a look , I &apos;ll zoom out so you can see what you get .
Here we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best part is still — in a second .
Let &apos;s jump to MoMA quickly , again in New York .
Another favorite picture of me , star eight . In the previous example , it was about finding detail .
But what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
And what if you want to see Van Gogh created this masterpiece ?
You zoomed in . You can actually go in .
I &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorite parts of this picture until I &apos;m really at the cracks .
This is star eight , probably never seen before .
Now I &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
There are many more , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
Each of you , everyone — equally rich or poor , whether you have a great house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online — from all of these images , you can put your own collection .
Very simple , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the zoom — you can zoom in .
This is &quot; &quot; The Guys , &quot; &quot; in the National Gallery .
You can miss it all with note , send your friends , and a conversation starts to think about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
And I think , in closing , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from Google .
They don &apos;t even come from museums , in my opinion .
I shouldn &apos;t say that .
They come from the artists .
And that was an experience in humility for me .
I mean , I hope that we &apos;re going to be talking to this digital medium of art , and we &apos;re going to represent it on a regular basis online .
And the biggest question I &apos;ve been asked recently is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot; &quot; The answer to that is no .
It &apos;s meant to fill in the experience .
That &apos;s what it is . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a storyteller .
That &apos;s what I do in my life — stories , novels , and today I want to share with you some stories about the art of storytelling , and also some supernatural creatures , the drunk .
But before I get there , please let me give you a quick glimpse of my personal story .
And I do that , of course , by using words , but also by a geometric shape , the circle , so over the course of my talk , you will meet several circles .
I was born in Strakburg , France , as a child of Turkish parents .
Shortly after that , my parents separated , and I moved to Turkey with my mother .
From there , I was raised as a single child of a single mother .
Now , in the early 1970s , this was a little bit unusual in Ankara .
In our neighborhood , there were large families everywhere where the fathers were the family top , so when I grew up , I recognized my mother as a gift in a patritic environment .
As I grew up , I could actually see two different types of women .
On the one hand , there was my mother , a trained , secular , modern , Western , Turkish woman .
On the other hand , my grandmother , who also matched to me , and she was much more spiritual , less educated , and certainly less rational .
This was a woman who read the future from the coffee shop , and Blei melted into mysterious forms to prevent the evil view .
A lot of people visited my grandmother , people with worse nuclei in their faces or warning on their hands .
Every time my grandmother murdered some words in Arabic , took a red apple and spotted it with so many rose orns as the number of goods she wanted to remove .
Then she circled these villages one after another with dark ink .
A week later , the patient usually came back to a investigation .
Now , I &apos;m aware that I shouldn &apos;t say things like this in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is that I was looking for all the people who were looking for my grandmother because of their skin problems , not seeing a single unhappy or unhappy going home .
I asked her how she did that . Was it the power of prayer ?
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pray is effective . But do you hate the power of circles . &quot; &quot; And from her , besides many other things , I learned a very valuable lesson : If you want to destroy something in this life , whether it &apos;s acne , a makel or the human soul , you just have to close it with thick walls .
It will dry in it .
Well , we all live in a kind of social and cultural circle .
We all do that .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
But if we don &apos;t have any connection to the worlds beyond the worlds that we take for granted , then we &apos;re also running out of danger .
Our power of imagination could shrink . Our hearts could be mutilated , and our humanity could be confused if we steal too long within our cultural cooperation .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all these people look like us in our inner circle , that means that we are surrounded by our own reflection .
Now , another thing that women like my grandmother do in Turkey is to hang mirrors with seed or hang them back to the walls on the back .
This is an ancient moral tradition that &apos;s based on knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time looking at his own image .
Ironically , &#91; life &#93; communities of peers is one of the greatest dangers of the globalized world .
And it &apos;s happening all over the place , under liberals and conservatives , agnostic and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West .
We tend to group education based on commonality , and then we create cliché about other groups of people .
I think one way to overcome this cultural ghettos is the art of storytelling .
Stories can &apos;t tear down borders , but they can beat holes in our mental walls .
And through these holes , we can take a look at the other ones , and sometimes we like what we see .
I started out with eight years of inventing and writing stories .
One day , my mother brought home a Turkish notebook and asked me if I &apos;d like to lead a journal .
In the back , I think she was probably a little worried about my mental health .
At home , I told pausless stories , which was good , because I told them imaginary friends who gave me what wasn &apos;t so good .
I was an introverted child , and that was so far that I was communicating with buntmen and apologizing in objects when I ran into them , so my mother thought it was good to write up my everyday experiences and emotions .
What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and what I most wanted to do was write about myself .
Instead , I started writing about other people as myself and about things that have never happened .
And at that time , my life passion for writing fiction began .
So from the beginning , fiction for me was less an autobiographical manifestation because a transcendent journey to other lives , other possibilities .
And please have a caution with me . I &apos;m going to draw a circle and come back to that point .
Now another thing happened around the same time .
My mother became a diplomatin .
So I was catapulated from this little , run-down middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother into this , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turkin .
And that &apos;s where I first met what I call &quot; &quot; representative foreigners . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children of all nationalities , but this diversity was not necessarily led to a cosmopolitical , egalitarian classrooms .
Instead , it created an atmosphere where every child was seen not as a separate individual , but as a representative of something bigger .
We were like a miniaturization of the United Nations , which was funny , because something negative happened that had to do with a nation or with a religion .
The child who represented this nation or religion was inevitably spotted , laughed and missed .
And I just know that , because during the time I went to this school , there was a millimeter coup in my home country , an ammocologist of my nationality would have killed almost the Pope , and Turkey got zero points at the Eurovision Song Contest .
( Laughter ) And in those days , I was swimming in school a lot , and I dreamed of driving to sea .
I also got my first sample of cultural climate change there .
The other kids asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; 12 o &apos;clock in the afternoon — Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I hadn &apos;t seen , and they explored how many cigarettes I smoked every day , because they thought all the towers were a cigarette smoke , and they wondered , at what age I would do to wear a headscarf .
I had to learn that these were the three main clients about my country , politics , cigarettes and the veil .
In Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and again to Ankara .
Everywhere I went , I felt that my imagination was the only suitcase I could take .
Stories gave me a sense of middle , persistence and collaboration , the three important things that I would have missed otherwise .
When I was in the mid-20s , I moved to Istanbul , to the city I love about everything .
I lived in a very vivid , diverse neighborhood where I wrote some of my novels .
I was in Istanbul when we met the earthquake in 1999 .
When I ran out of the building at three o &apos;clock in the morning , I saw something that made me stop .
There was the local food trailer — a cute old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t talk to outsiders .
He was sitting next to a transvester with a long black persuade and a whimperor that ran down their cheeks .
I watched the man with shaky hands open a package of cigarettes and offered her , and this is the picture I see in front of me today , from the night of the earthquake — a conservative shrimp and a vibrating transvestit that smoke on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and destruction , our profane differences in air , and we all became one , even for a few hours .
I &apos;ve always believed that stories have a similar impact .
I &apos;m not saying that fiction is the size of an earthquake , but if we read a good novel , we leave our little , discomfort apartments behind us , go out alone to the night and learn people we never met before , and we may have even convicted .
Shortly after that , I went to college to a Women &apos;s College in Boston , after Michigan .
I experienced this not so much as local change , but rather than linguistic .
I started writing fiction in English .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , I &apos;m not a refugee or an exilant . I &apos;m asked why I do this , but the commute between languages allows me to reinvent myself .
I love writing in Turkish , which is very poetic and very emotional to me , and I love writing in English , which is very mathematical and intellectual to me .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
For me , like millions of other people in the world today , English is an inherent language .
If you learn a language late , like a nightbulb , you live there with an ongoing and continuous frustration .
As nightmares , we want to say more and more , you know , make better jokes , say better things , but at the end we say less , because it created a gap between the mind and the tongue .
And that gap is very intimidating .
But if we can &apos;t fear it , it &apos;s also terrifying .
And that &apos;s what I discovered in Boston — that frustration can be very frightening .
At that point , my grandmother , who had tracked my life with growing concern , started to join me in their daily prayers , because I was desperately marrying so I could always leave myself down .
And because God loves her , I married .
( Laughter ) But instead of leaving me down , I moved to Arizona .
And since my husband lives in Istanbul , I started to squeeze between Arizona and Istanbul , two places on the Earth &apos;s surface that could not be different .
I suspect part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritual .
Stories join me , hold my property and my memories together , like an existential glue .
And as much as I love stories , I recently began to think that they lose their magic when a story is no longer seen as history .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to think about with you .
When my first book was published in English , I got an interesting message to hear a literary criticist .
&quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you &apos;d written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There are so many Spanish American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only a Turkish character , and this is a man . &quot; &quot; Now , the novel played on a university campus in Boston , so for me it was normal that there should be more international characters in it than Turkish characters . But I understood what my criticism was .
And I also understood that I would continue to disappoint him .
He wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book , because incidentally I was one .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see the world of identity policy affects the way that stories are read and discussed .
Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it stronger .
If you &apos;re a female author from the Muslim world , as I am , you would expect you to write the stories of Muslim women , preferably the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
You &apos;d expect you to write informative , profound and typical stories and leave your experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in this school in Madrid is the same thing in the literary world today .
The writers are not seen as creative , separate individuals , but as the representatives of their own culture , some authors from China , some from Turkey , some from Nigeria .
All of us are told we have something very familiar if not property .
The writer and Pendler between the worlds , James Baldwin , in 1984 , gave an interview where he was asked repeatedly after his homosexuality .
When the interviewer tried to put it in a box as a faint writer , Baldwin stopped him and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see it ? In me there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s not in any other person , and nothing in any other person that &apos;s not in me . &quot; &quot; If the identification policies tries to put us in the shoes , our freedom of imagination is in danger .
There &apos;s this weak category called multicultural literature , where all the authors are thrown together outside the Western world .
I will never forget my first multicultural reader at Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one of the Phillippines , a Turkish and an Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason we were brought together was not because we had a similar artistic style or literary taste .
It was just because of our cheese .
And multicultural writers are expected to tell true and not so sophisticated stories .
The fiction is meant to function .
So not only the writers themselves , but their fictional characters become representative of something bigger .
But I have to add quickly that this tendency to look at a story not just as a story , not just from the West .
This is everywhere .
And I learned that in my own suffering , because in 2005 , I was introduced to court because of the words that my filthy character was in a novel .
I wanted to write a constructive , diverse novel that talked about an arbitrary and a Turkish family from a woman &apos;s point of view .
My tiny story became a huge issue , because I was haunted .
Some people criticized me , others made me think that I had written about the Turkish arsenic conflict .
But there were times , I wanted to remind both sides that it was about fiction .
It was just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; only one story , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t try to clarify my work .
I want to love fiction and celebrate for what it is , not as a means for purpose .
The writers have a right to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of everyday politics .
Tschechow said , &quot; &quot; Well , the solution of a problem and the right way to ask a question is two totally different things .
And only for the last one is responsibility for the artist . &quot; &quot; identification policy shares us . Fiktion connects us .
One is interested in broader generalizations .
The other thing about nuances .
One pulls boundaries .
The other one doesn &apos;t recognize .
identity policy is built out of solid stones .
Fiktion is running water .
In the Bosnian time , there were amazing storytellers who said , &quot; &quot; Meddah . &quot; &quot; They went to the coffee houses , where they told a story in front of an audience , often an improvisation .
With every new person in history , the meddah changed his voice , signed that character .
Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
Stories emphasize all borders . Like &quot; &quot; The stories of Nasreddin Hodscha , &quot; &quot; which were very popular all over the Middle East , in North Africa , in the Balkan , and in Asia .
Today , stories still penetrate the boundaries .
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk to each other , they don &apos;t usually listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still read a novel from a Jewish author and vice versa , they feel connected to the narrator .
Literature must lead us to the other side .
If she can &apos;t get us there , it &apos;s not a good literature .
Books have saved the introverted , intimidating child that I was — that I once was .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger that you can &apos;t pick books up .
When the poet and Mystian Rumi met his spiritual gadgets of Shams Tabrizi , first of all , Rumis &apos;s books in the water and watched the letters disappear .
The Sufis says , &quot; &quot; You know , that doesn &apos;t take you beyond yourself is much worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not the lack of knowledge . We know a lot from each other , or we think that at least . But knowledge that doesn &apos;t lead us beyond ourselves makes us elitarian , distance and separates us .
There &apos;s a metaphor that I love : life like a drawing disgust .
As you know , a thickness of the circus remains static in one place .
As the other limb draws a whole circle , it moves all the time .
That &apos;s the same with my fiction .
Part of it is embedded in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part is taking the world , connecting different cultures together .
So I want to see my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and from everywhere .
Now , those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen the Topki palace , which has been the residency of the osmanic sultane for over 400 years .
In the palace , outside the quarters of the favorite cookies , there &apos;s a place called the Dutinn convention site .
It &apos;s between the buildings .
I &apos;m fascinated with this concept .
Usually , we &apos;re measuring areas that are between things .
We think of them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the sink that made out of pure fire and are a symbol of moisture .
I want to make the point that maybe this fleeting space is what writers and artists need most .
When I write fiction , I feel humidity and vulnerability .
I don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s going to happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I could write a novel about a Muslim woman , and maybe this will be a happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a benign , weak professor in Norway .
As long as it comes out of our hearts , we can write about everything .
Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think so I am . &apos; &quot; She proposed , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think that was a wonderful paradigm shift .
And yet , why are the students taught in the course of creative writing today as the first thing they should write about what they know ?
Maybe that &apos;s not the right way to start .
In fictional literature , it &apos;s not necessarily about who we are or what we know or what makes our identity .
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write about what we feel .
We should come out of our own cultural ghetto and visit the next and over again .
At the end , the stories will turn like dancing derwiches , draw circles across circles .
They connect the entire humanity , despite identification policies , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I &apos;d like to end with an old Sufi poem . &quot; &quot; Come , let &apos;s be friends for once ; let &apos;s make life easier ; let &apos;s be loving and loving ; the earth is not supposed to belong to you . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design video games .
We &apos;re reaching more in towels .
Today , all the World of Warcrafi players have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
It &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
We become collaborative , heroic creatures .
As a result , we build stronger social relationships .
Five million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
His work is great . He &apos;s looking at why .
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimism situation .
We need to start turning the real world into a game .
Before these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep boards .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
This is the exciting thing .
Herodotus was turned into 18 years , so the king decided to use a last cube game .
We imagine epic victions and giving people the opportunity to reach them .
The game is 2007 .
This is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
We have a comic about it . We have Level high for regional understanding , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
The crew of Dirty jobs , and I was hired to a small town in Colorado called Craig .
It stretches only over a few dozen square miles and lies in the Rocky Mountains .
And the real job was shepherding .
My role in the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s quite banal .
I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who are actually practicing the professions .
And my job is to just try to stay in and give you a true sense of what it is like to put in the skin of these people , a day in their lives .
The proper job — chasing sheep . All right .
We drive to Craig and we check into a hotel next day , and the next day I realize that castration is going to be a central part of this work .
So , usually I don &apos;t do any research at all .
But this is a sacred thing , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to represent whatever we do , correctly , and we certainly want to do with a lot of respect for the animals .
So I called the Human Society , and I said , &quot; &quot; Guys , I &apos;m going to paste a few bucks , can you tell me how this works ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s very simple . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , just a little bit smaller .
This was actually wrapped up around the cards that I got yesterday , but it had some kind of intimacy .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , how exactly are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is tied around the tail , straff .
And then another band is bound around the scrotum , straw .
The blood flow is slowly interrupted , a week later , the appropriate parts fall off .
&quot; Whtop ! All right . &quot;
OK , I call the SPCA to confirm the information — confirm it .
I call PETA , just like Jux , and they don &apos;t like it , but they confirm it .
OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
So the next day I go .
And I get a horse , and we get the wheels , and we lead them to a treadmall that we built , and we run viral economy .
Melanie is Alberts &apos;s wife .
Albert is the championed juicer .
Melanie is taking the sound up — with both hands — a hand around both legs on the right , and also on the left .
The tribe is put on the boxes , it reaches out .
All right . Great .
Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is there .
I always look at the process before I try .
As an apprentice , you know , you do that .
Albert reaches into his pocket to , you know , this black band hevorate , but what comes to the front is a knife .
And I think that &apos;s not a rubber at all .
And he grabbed it in a way that could capture the sunlight that just fell over the Rocky Mountains , it was very — it was , it was amazing .
Within about two seconds , Albert had the knife under the cartilage of the tail , right on the tail of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and the bucket I held .
A second later , he had , with a big thumb and a very horizontal line , the scrotum safely in his handle .
And he pulled it up to himself , like this , and he took the knife and put it on the top .
Now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; You know what &apos;s coming , Michael . &apos; You don &apos;t know . OK .
He cuts them off , puts the top over his shoulder , and then he grabs the scrotum , and he squeezes it up , and then his head bumps down , slips my look , but what I hear is a smiley loud and a sound that sounds like you &apos;re dragging a glue from a sticky wall , and I &apos;m not making a jokes .
Can we play the video ?
No , I &apos;m just kidding — we won &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it &apos;s the best way to speak in images .
So , and then I do something that I &apos;ve never done in a shot of Dirty Jobs .
I say , &quot; &quot; Hold . Stop . &quot; &quot; You all know the show , we use Take One , we don &apos;t make Take Two .
There &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
We &apos;re not silly around , we &apos;re not sampling , we &apos;re filming what we get !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . That &apos;s insane . I mean , honestly .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s crazy .
We can &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; And Albert says , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened here , but there are testicles in the bucket , and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; What do you get to do it like this ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him the way . &quot; &quot; And I said to him .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t circulate and blur — we &apos;re emitted on five continents , man .
We &apos;re being rushed twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he puts out a bag of these little rubber bands .
Melanie grabs another tribe , puts it on the paste , the band is wrapped around the tail , the band is tied around the scrotum .
The sponge falls to the floor , the sponge goes two steps , falls , it stands up , it &apos;s shaking easy , it &apos;s going to take a few more steps , falls .
And I think that &apos;s not a good sign for the tribe , not at all .
It stands up , it walks in the corner , it &apos;s shaking , and it lays down , and it &apos;s clearly suffering .
And I look at the lobe and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
When does it come back ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take to fall ? &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
The tribe that he &apos;s just completed his little procedure walking around , the blood flow stopped .
It smells of grass , totally out of it .
And I was just overwhelmed with how wrong I was in that second .
And I was reminded of how completely wrong I was , so often .
( Laughter ) And most of all , I was reminded of what a sunny saliva I had pulled out of the day , because now I had to do what Albert had done just before , and in the case of it , about 100 of these storms were located , and all of a sudden the whole thing came to me like a German Porno , and I think , Melanie &apos;s putting up the tribe , it &apos;s stretched to the Band-Aid .
Albert &apos;s going to give me the knife .
I &apos;m going to go , the tail is coming down .
I &apos;m going to go , grab the scrotum , the top is coming down .
Albert calls me , &quot; &quot; Put it upward . &quot; &quot; I do that .
&quot; Keep it going . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
The testicles come to the front , they look like thumbs coming towards you , and he says , &quot; &quot; To both .
Just take them off . &quot; &quot; And I understood him , I heard all his words .
( Laughter ) But how — how did I get into this situation ?
How — you know — I mean , how did I get into this situation ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the thoughts self-assemble , and suddenly I &apos;m standing there in the Rocky Mountains , and the only thing I can think about is the Aristotle definition of a tragedy .
Aristotle says a tragedy is the moment the hero is faced with face-to-face face with his own identity .
( Laughter ) And I think , &quot; &quot; How do I get to this weird metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get the thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t avoid having that vision in front of my eyes , so I did what I had to do .
I swept out , and I took them .
I took them like this , and I pulled my face back rusty .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testes on my child .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
OK , I &apos;m still involved with poetics , with Aristotle , and I think all of a sudden , two words appear in my head that I haven &apos;t heard , since my professor of classics had embedded them in my classroom .
And this is Anagnorisis and Peripeteia .
Anagnorisis and Peripetria .
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for recognition .
And literally the transition from ignorance to knowledge , that &apos;s Anagnorisis .
What our channel does , it &apos;s what Dirty jobs do .
And I get up to the neck every day in Anagnorisis .
Fantastic .
The other word , Peripeteia , describes the moment in great tragedies , in which , you know , Euripides and Sophokles — the moment that Audipus has his moment in which he suddenly recognizes that the hot girl that he slept with , his children , is his mother . OK .
This is Peripetty or Peripetria .
And this metaphor in my head was — I have Anagnorisis and Peripeteia on my child .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , it &apos;s a great lesson .
Once you look for Peripeteia , you find them everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
Try the whole film to help the little child who sees deceased people , and then boom — oh , I &apos;m dead — Peripeteia .
You know ?
It &apos;s depressing when the audience sees this .
Neo in &quot; &quot; Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know .
Oh , I live in a computer program — that &apos;s weird .
These revelations that lead to sudden insights , and I kept going over and over again , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but these — this one kind of blew me in a way that I didn &apos;t like .
And when I was standing there looking at the happy tribe that I had just sat down — but it looked OK .
When I looked at the other poor thing , where I had done the whole thing in the correct way , the thought that when I was wrong , and when I was so often wrong , literally , what other perietal misconcepts could I relate to ?
Because , you see , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who is one .
And I &apos;m going to talk to him .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested or not , but are you aware that you filmed in any state ?
You &apos;ve worked in mines , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel bars , you &apos;ve worked in any major industry .
You &apos;ve stood aside by side to the people that our politicians are desperately trying to build a relationship every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary sitting in front of me , drinking Rye Whiskey with the steel worker that her child walks down .
I mean , these are the people I work with for day .
And if you have something to say about their thoughts , in their totality , it &apos;s time to think about it .
Because , you know , human , four years . You know , this is my head when I have the testicles on my child , the thoughts jump around .
And Dirty jobs didn &apos;t really change after these screens , in terms of what the show is , but for me personally , it changed .
And when I talk about the show now , I no longer just tell the story you &apos;ve heard , and 190 similar .
I do that , but I also talk about some other things that I was wrong about , some other ideas in terms of work that I thought was unacceptable , and they &apos;re not .
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
As a group , they are the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start by whistling &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all the other happy workers &apos; crap .
I &apos;m just going to tell you that these are people who are doing unbelievable work .
People who read survivors animals whistle during the work , I swear to God , I did it with them .
They have this amazing symmetry in their lives .
And I see this over and over again .
So I asked myself , what would happen if we challenge some of these sacred fooks ?
As a result of your passion — this is what we &apos;ve been talking about in the last 36 hours .
And as a result of your passion — what might be wrong with this ?
Where the worst advice I &apos;ve ever received .
( Laughter ) Leave your dreams and go bankrupt , right ?
I mean , this is all I got to hear when I grew up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but they told me , if you follow your passion , everything goes in .
I can give you 30 examples from the state — Bob Combs , the swine builder from Las Vegas , who collects the food remains of the Casinos and feed them to his pigs .
Why ? Because in the things we don &apos;t eat , so much protein is that his pigs grow twice as fast , and he &apos;s a rich pig builder , and he &apos;s good for the environment , and he &apos;s spending his days doing this incredible service , and he smells horrible , but God is enjoyable .
He &apos;s got a great deal .
They ask him , &quot; &quot; Are you followed your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he would laugh at you .
The value of this man — he was recently offered 60 million dollars for his farm , and he suggested the offer , outside of Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He stepped back , and he looked at what everybody else did , and he went in the opposite direction .
And I hear this story over and over again .
Matt Froind , a New Canaan milk maker , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized that the crap of his cows was more value than her milk , if he could use it to make biologically degradable flowers .
Now he sells them to Walmart .
Sending passion — this man is — I &apos;m asking you .
So I started looking at passion , and I started looking at efficiency versus efficiency , which Tim talked about earlier , which is a big difference .
I started looking closer at teamwork and determination , and basically all these connections that are called &quot; &quot; Successories , &quot; &quot; which are now related to these shiny works of art around the world .
All of this — all of a sudden everything &apos;s turned on its head .
Safety — security is coming .
to get back to OSHA and PETA and Human Society . What if OSHA is wrong ?
I mean , this is heresy , what I &apos;m going to say now , but what if security is actually in the third place ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean , really .
What I really want to say is that my safety is important to me in these crazy jobs , just like the people I work with , but those who really do everything , they &apos;re not out there talking about security .
You know that other things are going on — the work is about getting everything done .
And I will never forget , on the Beringmeer , there I was on a crabbenot with the men of Deadliest Catch , who I worked with in the first panel .
We &apos;re about 100 miles away from the kiss of Russia , 50 feet high seas , huge waves , green water is erasing over the tax heel .
The most hostile environment I &apos;ve ever seen , and I was in the back with a man to tie the crabs .
So I &apos;m 40 feet above the deck , which is sort of like looking down at the top of your shoe , and you &apos;re doing that in the middle of the ocean .
Incredible dangerous .
I &apos;m sticking down , I &apos;m going to tax heels , and I &apos;m saying , with a certain degree of disbelief , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? — ocean . &quot; &quot; And he looks outside .
( Laughter ) But in the moment he said next , he can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
It can &apos;t be repeated in any factory and no construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Boy , &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s in my age , by the way , and he calls me boy , I think that &apos;s great — he says , &quot; &quot; Boy , I &apos;m the captain of a crabbath .
My duty is not to get you home alive .
My duty is to let you go home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) If you want to come home alive , that &apos;s your business .
And the rest of the day , that &apos;s security .
And I think — the idea that we &apos;re making this false — this sense of indifference , if everything we &apos;re talking about is the responsibility of others , as if it was our own , and vice versa .
Anyway , lots of things .
I could talk forever about the many small submissions that we &apos;ve presented , and the endless list of things that I was wrong with .
But basically , I come to this conclusion .
I designed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it with you now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
It &apos;s the following — we &apos;ve explained the work as a society , each of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , basically .
We didn &apos;t plan to rescue him , and we didn &apos;t delete our mustache in Machiavellic way , but we did .
And we &apos;ve been doing this war at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we work people on television , it &apos;s ridiculous .
When you see a plumber , he weighs 300 pounds , and you see his pill , give it up .
You see it all the time .
This is what plumber looks like , right ?
We make them heroes , or we make them pool .
This is what television does .
At Dirty Jobs , we &apos;re really struggling to do that , which is why I do the job and not cheat .
But we do this war on Madison Avenue .
I mean , so many of the commercials that are shown there — as a message , what is really being said in it ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less if you didn &apos;t have to work that hard if you could go home a little earlier , if you could put something in the early days , if you could do something early on , that &apos;s all in it , over and over again .
Washington — I can &apos;t start talking about the existing treatments and policies that affect the quality of the jobs available , because I really don &apos;t know .
I just know it &apos;s one of the front lines in this war .
And right here , Silicon Valley . I mean , how many people have an iPhone on it ?
How many people have Blackberries ?
We are connected . We are connected .
I would never want to make the impression that from the technological revolution , something bad happened .
My goodness , not to this audience .
( Laughter ) But I would point out that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
And no one celebrates imitation in the way that the boys of Dirty jobs should be done .
Their iPhone without the people who make the same skin , same circuits , the same keyboard , over and over again .
All of this — this is what enables it to be the same as the genius that &apos;s inside .
So we have these new tools .
Our tools of today don &apos;t look like layers and chairs .
They look like the things that we &apos;re walking around with .
And the collective effect of this is the marginalization of many professions .
And I realized , probably too late — I don &apos;t hope , because I don &apos;t know if I can film 200 more of these things , but we &apos;re going to film as many as we can .
And the most important thing for me is to know and really accept that I was wrong with a lot of things , not just the testicles on my child .
I was wrong with a lot of things .
So we think , with &apos; I mean &apos; — that it &apos;s time to talk about an advertising campaign for work , physical work , technical work .
Somebody has to be out there and talk about those who are in forgiveness .
I &apos;m talking about things that our grandfathers tell us , the things that many of us probably grew up with , but we kind of — you know , sort of lost a little bit .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
Infrastructure is a huge business .
In this war against the work that I think it exists , there are victims like in any other war .
Infrastructure is the first . Sink numbers of entry in trade schools are the second .
Every year there are fewer electrics , less sheets , less plumbers , less silver , less pipeline installers , less heating installers .
The jobs in the infrastructure that everybody wants to create are these people . Those whose numbers are staggering .
Meanwhile , we have to spend two trillion dollars , at least , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers , to just make a wave into the infrastructure that &apos;s currently being named at a four billion .
So I would , if I knew what I &apos;m not doing , just say that the jobs that we hope to produce , and the jobs that we hope to create will not be durable if it &apos;s not jobs that people want .
And I know the purpose of this conference is to celebrate the things that are dear to us and costly , but I also know that clean and dirty are not headaches .
They &apos;re two sides of the same medal , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like Peripetria and Anagnorisis , like the poor tribe , which is hopefully not on the shake , and my time that &apos;s gone down .
It was great to talk to you , and go back to work , OK ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very , very small idea , but it can initiate billions of big ideas that are in the future right now .
And my little idea that does that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There are louder elite women in this room .
Louder women who get too little sleep .
I myself learned from bitter experience of what sleep is worth .
Two and a half years ago , I descended from exhausting .
I swallowed my head on the desk , and I broke the joint leg , and I was paralyzed at the right eye five times .
So I set out to rediscover the value of the sleep .
Over the course of this journey , I &apos;ve been studying medical professionals and scientists , and I &apos;m here today to tell you that the path to a richer , creative and enjoyable life is to make enough sleep .
( Applause ) We want women to be at this new revolution in this new feminist task as a precursor .
We &apos;re literally going to sleep up .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , sleep deprivation for the men has become a sign of manhood .
Recently , I was sitting in a restaurant with a man who breathed with it , that he had only had four hours of sleep in the night .
And I wanted to tell him — but I didn &apos;t tell him , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you &apos;d been sleeping for five hours , our group reefs here would have surely gotten a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s currently there , something like a sleep deficit rivalence , especially here .
In Washington . If you want to say to the breakfast and say , &quot; &quot; How about 8 a.m. &quot; &quot; You certainly get the answer : &quot; &quot; 8 o &apos;clock is too late for me , but okay , I &apos;m going to push a round of tennis and a few phone conversations in between and then you meet eight . &quot; &quot; And then people also think they &apos;re incredibly flourishing and they &apos;re in politics , but we &apos;re not in business leaders .
So high IQ guarantees a long time .
Not a good leader , because good quality of leadership shows that you see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
But we have too many icebergs that meet our Titanics .
I could even imagine that Lehman Brothers , if it were Lehman Brothers and Sisters , could still exist today .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy running on holidays 24 hours a day , a sister might have been watching the iceberg , because it would have been woke up after seven and a half hours of sleep and could have seen the big connection .
So what is happening today , where we are faced with all the different crises around the world , for us , is good at an individual level , and what brings more joy , gratitude and success to our lives , and best for our personal trajectory , that &apos;s the best for the whole world .
So I urge you to close your eyes and discover all the big ideas that are inside us , put your motor down and discover the power of sleep !
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
As I &apos;ve been trained by Chris , I study the human brain — the function and structure of the human brain .
And I want you to briefly start to realize what that means .
We have this opportunity here — three pounds of opportunity you can hold in a hand — you can look at the infinite expansion of space .
It can inspire the meaning of infinity and look at itself , how it sends about the meaning of infinity .
This particular recursive property — self-esteem — I think the Holy Grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
Well , how do you study this mysterious organ ?
I mean , we have 100 billion neurons , little bundles of protoplasma that interact with each other , and from that , the entire spectrum of skills that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How do we do that ?
Well , there are different ways of studying the functions of the brain .
The most common approach is to look at patients with permanent damage to local brain regions where there have been genetic changes in small regions .
So what &apos;s happening is not a general decrease in mental abilities , so a kind of slowing down cognitive ability .
The result is a highly selective loss of a single function while the other functions remain maintained , and that gives us a certain kind of security to the assumption that this part of the brain has to be involved in the delivery of this function .
So then it allows a function to form a structure to figure out what the circuits are going on to cause that function .
That &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re trying to do .
Let me give you a couple of impressive examples .
I &apos;m going to give you three examples during this talk — six minutes per example .
The first is a very extraordinary syndrome , Capgras syndrome .
On the first slide here , you see the temporal lobe , the frontal lobe and the frontal lobe — the lobes that make the brain .
And because of the interior of the temporal lobe — you can &apos;t see it here , unfortunately — is a little structure called the gyrus fusiform .
It &apos;s also known as the facial region of the brain , because after their damage , you can &apos;t see people &apos;s faces .
You can still see them through their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s Joe . &quot; &quot; But if you look at them , you don &apos;t know who they are .
You can &apos;t even see yourself in the mirror .
Of course you know that you have to be when you &apos;re blind and your counterparts are also blinking , and you know you &apos;re in front of a mirror , but you can &apos;t really see yourself as yourself .
It &apos;s known that this syndrome is caused by damage to the gyrus fusiform .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rarely that very few medical professionals and don &apos;t even know neurologists .
It &apos;s Capgras syndrome . It can be described to you that a patient who &apos;s otherwise completely normal after a head injury , looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This person looks exactly like my mother , but she &apos;s a gear .
She &apos;s another woman who just pretends to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How does this happen ?
This person is otherwise in clear mind and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , his delusions , and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
The most common explanation for what you can find in all psychiatric textbooks is a Freudian notion . It says that this guy — and the same thing is true for women , but I &apos;m going to limit to men here .
As a little baby , you have a strong sexual desire for your mother .
This is the so-called odipus complex for Freud .
I &apos;m not saying that I believe it , but that &apos;s the usual Freudian view .
And then when you grow up , the cortex develops and inhibits that hidden sexuality across your mother .
Thank God , otherwise we would all be sexually excited every time we see our mother .
Now , if you get a blow on your head that damages the cortex and releases your hidden sexual power that &apos;s flushing to the surface , suddenly you feel very , very explicitly sexually exhilarating from your mother .
And you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; My God , if that &apos;s my mother , how can I be sexually excited ?
She has to be another woman . She &apos;s a gear . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the only explanation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
For me , this theory has never made a lot of sense .
It &apos;s very resourceful , like all the Freudian theories . ( Laughter ) But it never made sense for me , because I could see the same delusation of a patient versus his poodle . ( Laughter )
He says , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . He looks like Fifi , but it &apos;s another dog . &quot;
Now try to apply the Freudian explanation here .
( Laughter ) You &apos;d have to suddenly talk about latent sodomy in all people , or something like that , which would be quite absurd , of course .
So what &apos;s really going on here ?
To explain this strange disorder , we look at the structure and the functions of the healthy visual perception in the brain .
Usually , visual signals will pick up the eyeballs and go into the visual areas of the brain .
In fact , there are 30 areas on the back of the brain that are only dealing with vision , and after the processing , the signal goes to a small structure , the gyrus fusiform , where you see faces .
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
So you could call this the facial area of the brain .
I talked about this before .
So when this area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
But from here , the signal goes further into a structure called Amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and this structure , the Amygdala , measures the emotional importance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it prey ? Is it an enemy ? Is it a partner ?
Or is it something trivial , like a bottle , a piece of chalk or — OK , maybe not — or a shoe or something like that ?
Something you can completely ignore .
So if the Amygdala is excited , and it &apos;s a very significant thing , then the signals are transferred to the autonomous nervous system .
Your heart starts to beat faster .
You start to sweat to spread the heat you &apos;re about to generate — muscle tension .
Fortunately , because we can put two electrodes in your palm and measure the change of skin resistance through the transition .
So if you look at something , I can see if you &apos;re excited , or whether they &apos;re excited or not .
And I &apos;ll come back to that in a second .
So my theory was this . If this guy looks at an object — any object — then the signal goes into the visual regions and is processed by the gyrus fusiform , and you see the object as an inheritance plant , a table , or in this case , as your mother .
Then the signal goes to Amygdala and from there to the autonomous nervous system .
But with this guy , the connection from the Amygdala to the limbic system — the emotional core of the brain — may have been broken through an accident .
Since the gyrus fusiform is still intact , he recognizes how in front of his mother and says , &quot; &quot; Yes , she looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the connection to the emotional center is interrupted , he says , &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t I feel the sense of heat when this is supposed to be my mother ? &quot; &quot; Really a gray .
( Laughter ) So he says , &quot; &quot; How can I explain these emotional cold ?
That can &apos;t be my mother .
This is an alien woman who pretends to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do we test this ?
We take one of you here and put it in front of a screen , measure its electrodes activity and show it images on the monitor , and I can measure how you sweat when you see an object like a table or a rainscreen — of course you don &apos;t sweat .
But if I show you a picture of a lion , a tiger or a pin-up girl , you start to sweat .
And believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — and we &apos;re talking about ordinary people here — start sweating .
They don &apos;t even have to be Jewish for that .
( Laughter ) So what happens when you take this patient ?
When you show these pictures on the monitor in this patient , using electrodes activity ?
Tables and chairs and rivers — nothing happens , just like normal people , but when I show him a picture of his mother , electrodes activity stays low .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother , because the connection between the visual regions is interrupted to the emotional center .
His vision is normal , because the visual regions are normal , and his emotions are normal . He laughs , he wakes and so on , but the connection of visual perception of emotion is interrupted by which the deception underlies , his mother would be a gunner .
This is a wonderful example of our work . You take a bizarre , seemingly unprecedented neural psychiatric syndrome , ask the usual Freudian point in question , and instead you answer a precise explanation by the known neural anatomy of the brain .
By the way , if this patient is now called by his mother in the back room , he takes off and says , &quot; &quot; Wow , Mom , how are you doing ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no exception over the phone .
Then she goes to him after an hour , and he &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
They look like my mother .
That &apos;s because there &apos;s a separate connection between the auditorium in the brain and the emotional center that was not broken by accident .
So that explains why he can detect his mother about the phone problematic .
But if he sees it , he thinks it &apos;s a cheesman .
So how does this complex design get in the brain ?
Is it nature like this , driven by genes or genes ?
We &apos;re trying to answer this question by looking at another weird syndrome — phantom limbs .
And you all know what phantom limbs are .
After the amputation of an arm or leg due to a gangras , or if you lose it / war , like in Iraq — there &apos;s a big problem right now — then you continue to feel the missing arm , which is called the phantom arm or phantom leg .
In fact , you can get a phantom for almost every part of your body .
Even if you believe it or not .
I had patients who had been removed from the utero — hysterectomy — and who have a phantom utero , including phantom menstruations , at the end of the month .
And a student actually asked me recently whether these patients can also have phantom-PMS .
( Laughter ) Definitely a question that requires more scientific investigation .
So the next question is , what can we learn experimentally about phantom limbs ?
So for example , what we found is that about half of the patients with phantom limbs admit that they can move the phantom body member .
It knocks his brother on the shoulder , it takes off the phone when it rings and winds to the goodbye .
We &apos;re talking about persuasive , vivid emotions .
This patient has no delay .
He knows that his arm is not there , but nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing , sensorial experience for him .
In the other half of the patients , it &apos;s not true .
They say , &quot; &quot; Mr. Doctor , my phantom body member is paralyzed .
It &apos;s solid in a crushed convulsion , and it &apos;s painful .
If I could just move it . Maybe the pain will disappear . &quot; &quot; But how can a phantom body member be paralyzed ?
It sounds like a contradiction in itself .
But what we found was that patients with a paralyzed phantom body member of the real arm was paralyzed by a peripheral nerve injury .
The nerve that &apos;s attached to the arm was separated , and it was separated , like a motorcycle accident .
So this patient actually had an arm that was painful for months or a year in a arms smile , and then , in a failed attempt to eliminate the pain in the arm , the surgeon has amputated the arm , and what &apos;s left is a phantom arm with the same pain .
This is a serious clinical problem .
Patients get depressed .
Some of them are driven in suicide .
So how do you treat this syndrome ?
Why do you even get a paralyzed phantom arm ?
In the medical record , I found that they all had a real arm whose nerves had been separated , so that the real arm was paralyzed and carried in a armor for months , and the pain will then transmit to the phantom body .
Why is this happening ?
As long as the arm is intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends orders to the arm and says , &quot; &quot; Move away ! &quot; &quot; But it gets visual feedback , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; Move away ! No ! Get out ! No ! Get out ! No ! No !
And that &apos;s hardwired in the circuit of the brain , and we call this a learning paralysis .
The brain learns because of the Hebbean learning mirror , that the mere command to move the arm is causing the feeling of a paralyzed arm .
Now , if you amputee the arm , this learning paralysis will translate into your body image and into your phantom body member .
So how do you help these patients ?
How do you reverse the learning paralysis to get it from the horrible , compressed convulsion of his phantom arm ?
Well , what would happen if you were to keep sending orders to the phantom body member , but giving him a visual feedback that his command is being performed ?
Maybe by doing that , you can solve the phantom pain , the convulsion in the phantom body member .
How do you do that ? Well , with virtual reality .
But that costs several million dollars .
So I found a way to do that for three dollars , but don &apos;t say that , please , my consensus .
( Laughter ) You need something called mirror box .
You take a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle where you put the phantom body flow , and my first patient was Derek .
His arm had been amputeed 10 years ago .
His arm was violently torn , so the nerves were separated , so the arm was paralyzed , lay in a arms smile for a year , and finally was amputated .
After that , he had a horribly painful phantom arm that he couldn &apos;t move .
It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
So he came up to me , and I gave him a mirror in a box that I call mirror box .
The patient puts his left phantom arm , which is crushed and punched , on the left side of the mirror , and the healthy arm on the right , and he mimics the same compressed posture of the other arm and looks in the mirror , and what does he perceive ?
He looks like his phantom arm is reviving , because in the mirror , he sees the reflection of his healthy arm , and it looks like his phantom arm had been washed up to new life .
&quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; wobble with your phantom arm — your healthy fingers , or move them as you look in the mirror . &quot; &quot; So he gives you the visual impression that his phantom arm moves .
This is illuminating , but the amazing thing is that the patient actually says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom arm is moving again and the pain that &apos;s compressed convulsion is solved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came to me — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , saw in the mirror , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Look at my arm &apos;s real . &quot; &quot; And he started to see my Ph.M.
He knows it &apos;s a mirror , but yet he has a clear sensorial experience .
Now I said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t move your healthy and your phantom arm . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t move my phantom arm . You know . It hurts . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Then you move your healthy arm . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom arm is moving again . I can &apos;t believe it !
And my pain is gone .
And then I said , &quot; &quot; Be your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closed his eyes .
&quot; Move your healthy arm . &quot;
&quot; Oh , nothing — he &apos;s ramped again . &quot;
&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , he &apos;s moving again . &quot;
He was like a kid in the sweet shop .
So that confirms my theory of inherited paralysis and the crucial role of visual perception , but I won &apos;t get a Nobel Prize for someone to move their phantom arm back .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But then I realized that maybe in other types of paralysis from neurology , like stroke accidents or focal dystonia , there might be a learned component that you could do with a similar facility .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek . &quot; &quot; Well , he can &apos;t run around all the time with a mirror to link his pain , and I told him , &quot; Derek , take the box home and practice it for one or two weeks . &quot;
Maybe after some time , you can divert on the mirror , learn paralysis , move your paralyzed arm back and free from the pain . &quot; &quot; He said , and took the box home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it costs only two dollars . Take it . &quot; &quot; So he took him home , and after two weeks he called me and he said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s gone ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; I thought the mirror box was gone .
( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no . My phantom arm I had for 10 years .
He &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; And I said — I was worried and I said , &quot; &quot; My God ! &quot; &quot; I mean , I changed the body picture of this man . What about human subjects , the ethics and everything ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , do you bother this ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , for the last three days , I didn &apos;t have a phantom arm , so no more phantom pain in the elbow , no convulsion , no phantom in the underarm , all my pain is gone .
I just have the problem that I &apos;ve got my phantom fingers now from my shoulder , and that &apos;s where your castle isn &apos;t going to go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; Could you just rebuild it so I can put it on my forehead , and if I do , get rid of my phantom finger ? &quot; He thought I was a kind of a magician .
Why did that happen ?
It &apos;s because the brain is faced with an enormous sensory conflict .
It receives visual signals that the phantom body member is back there .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no adequate feedback . The muscles report that there &apos;s no arm .
And your motor tax command says that there &apos;s an arm , and because of this conflict , the brain says , &quot; Keep with it . There &apos;s no phantom arm , there &apos;s no arm . &quot;
It falls into a state of refusion — interconnects every signal .
And with the phantom arm , the pain disappears , because there &apos;s no physical pain that frees freely through the room .
That &apos;s the good thing about it .
This technology has already been sampled to dozens of patients — from other groups in Helsinki , so it could have proven to be a valuable treatment for phantom pain , and in rehabilitation of stroke , it &apos;s been proven to be proven .
When you get a stroke , you think about the most damaged fibers that you can &apos;t do anything about .
But it turns out that a certain part of this paralysis is also learning paralysis , and maybe you can force those components with mirrors .
These techniques have already gone through clinical tests and helped many patients .
Well , let me now go to the third part of my talk , which is about another , strange phenomenon called synesthesia .
Synesthesia was discovered in the 19th century by Francis Galton .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
He found that certain people in the population who are otherwise completely normal have these following abnormalities , each time they see a digit , it &apos;s colorful .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is green , nine is indigo colors .
I want you to remember that these individuals are otherwise completely normal .
Or Cis . Sometimes sound call colors .
Cis is blue , Fis is green , another tone could be yellow .
How does this happen ?
It &apos;s called synesthesia — Galton called it synesthesia , a mixture of the senses .
We &apos;re all separate from each other .
These individuals are throwing their senses apart .
Why is this happening ?
One of the two aspects of this phenomenon is very amazing .
Synesthesia is in the family . Galton said that there is a genetic basis .
Secondly , synesthesia — and this brings me to the main issue of this talk , creativity — synesthesia is about eight times more common in artists , poets , writers and other creative people than in the general population .
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
So , what is synesthesia ? What is it caused by ?
Well , there are many theories about this .
One says these guys are just nuts .
It &apos;s not really scientific , so we forget it .
Another one is that it &apos;s all about LSD junkies and Kiffer .
There may be some truth to it , because it &apos;s more skilled here in the San Francisco Bay than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) All right , the third theory says — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what really happens in synesthesia .
We found that the regions for colors and for digits are immediately next to each other in the brain , in the gyrus fusiform .
So it comes to a neat cross-section between colors and digits within the brain .
So every time you see a Ziffer , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you have synesthesia .
Now think about — how does that happen ?
Why should there be these cross-bonds in some people ?
Remember I said it was in the family ?
That &apos;s the key .
And that is , there &apos;s an anormal gene , an mutation in the gene that causes these quarteries .
It turns out that all of us , at birth , all areas of the brain are interconnected .
So every brain region is connected to each other , and over time , these cross-combinations are reduced — the characteristic , modular structure of the adulated brain .
So if there &apos;s a gene that &apos;s responsible for that , and when that gene mutates , the connection between adjured brain regions remains .
And if it &apos;s between numbers and color regions , it leads to dental color synesthesia .
If it &apos;s between sound and color regions , the Ton Farbsynesthesia .
So far , so good .
So what happens when this gene works all over the brain , and there are cross-combinations everywhere ?
Think about what artists , writers and poets have in common — the ability to think in metaphors , attacks that seem to be without relationship , like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the east and Julia is the sun . &quot; &quot; Well , that doesn &apos;t mean that Julia is the sun . Does it mean it &apos;s a glorious celebration ball ?
I mean , schizophrenics think that , but that &apos;s a different subject .
And ordinary people would say it &apos;s warm like the Sun , it &apos;s radiating like the Sun , it &apos;s naked like the Sun .
They immediately created the benefits .
Now , if you think about this , these quarters and ideas come in different parts of the brain , that leads to a higher slope for metaphorical thinking and creativity in synesthesists .
So the eight times higher prevalence of synesthesia among poets , artists and writers .
This is a very phronological view of synesthesia .
One last example — did I have one minute ?
( Applause ) All right , I &apos;m going to prove to you that you &apos;re all synesthesists , but you don &apos;t want to see it .
This is the Martian alphabet , just like our alphabet . A is A , B is B , C is C.
Other symbols for other sounds .
So here we have the Martian alphabet .
One of these symbols is Kiki , the other Bouba .
What is Kiki , which is Bouba ?
Who here thinks this is Kiki and this is Bouba ? Raise your hand .
Well , there are one or two mutants .
( Laughter ) Who here believes this is Bouba and this is Kiki ? Raise your hand .
99 percent of you .
None of you is Marsians . How did you do that ?
That &apos;s because you make all the joint connections — a synesthetic abstraction , which means you realize that the sharp pitch box in your auditory cortex — where the shark cells are crushed — Ki-ki , the visual shape — sharp edges — this shaky shape .
That &apos;s very important . Because what it tells us is that our brain is a primitive — it looks like a dumb illusion , but the photons are creating this shape in your eye , and the hair cells in your ear are suggesting the auditory patterns , but the brain is able to pull out the common denominator .
This is a primitive form of abstraction , and by now we know that it &apos;s happening in the gyrus fusiform of the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba-Kiki , and they also lose understanding of metaphors .
If you ask someone like this , what &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not all gold , which is smooth . &quot; &quot; the patient will say , &quot; &quot; Well , just because it &apos;s metallic and smooth , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
You &apos;d have to measure your specific density . &quot; &quot; So they didn &apos;t understand the metaphorical meaning at all .
Now this area is about eight times larger in higher primates — especially in humans — than in lower primates .
Something very interesting happens here in the gyrus angularis , because it &apos;s the connection between hearing , vision and fireflies , and in humans it &apos;s particularly coined — something very interesting happens here .
I think it &apos;s the basis of many people predisabled skills , like abstraction , metaphorical thinking and creativity .
So all of these questions that philosophers have asked for millennia , we can start to study scientists through brain imaging and analyzing patients and the right questions .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
14 years ago , I first came across this ordinary material , fish law , which has been used for centuries in the same way .
Today I &apos;m using it to create continuous , assembling , rich shapes , the size of real buildings in cities around the world .
I wasn &apos;t the person you would expect .
I &apos;ve never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after college , I was waiting for seven art schools , and I was rejected by all seven .
So I went to become an artist &apos;s own fist , and I painted for 10 years until I got a bullbright for India .
To give up the promise , I hired my pictures , and I got to Mahabalipuram .
The appointment came for the exhibition — my images didn &apos;t come .
I had to do something .
This fisherman village was famous for sculptures .
So I tried bronze .
But making big shapes was too difficult and too expensive .
I went to the beach , and I watched the fishermen pop up their nets on the sand .
Every day I &apos;d seen this , but this time I saw it with other eyes — a new way of making sculptures , a way to make volumetric forms without severe , solid materials .
My first satisfying sculpture was created in collaboration with these fishermen .
It &apos;s a self-portrait called &quot; &quot; broad hip . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hated it to photography .
I discovered that their soft surface of each wind was revealed by changing patterns .
I was hypnotized .
I continued to study craftsmanship traditions and collaborate with artists , next with clunkers in lightning .
I liked the fine detail that was going through my work , but I wanted to make it bigger — from an object that you &apos;re looking at to something by losing .
Back in India to work with these fishermen , we made a network of a million and a half million hand-cracked nodes — which was just launched in Madrid .
Thousands of people have seen it , and one of them was the city planner Manual Sola morality that redesigned the subference rate in Porto , Portugal .
He asked me if I could build this as an enduring piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that , and I could preserve my art .
Resilience , constructed , permanent — these are headaches to self-reliable , graceful and convenient .
For two years , I was looking for a fiber that could resist UV rays , salty air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move in the wind .
We needed something to keep the web out there in the middle of the roundabout .
So we raised this 20 tons of steel ring .
We had to make him so ferred that he could move on in a normal crisis , and he could cross Hurricane .
But there was no manufacturing software to model something vital and moving .
I found a brilliant aerial engineer of the sail designed for the Rennyachs of America &apos;s Cups called Peter Heppel .
He helped me tackle this double challenge : precisely shape and soft motion .
I couldn &apos;t build it in the way that I know , because hand-knitting nodes can &apos;t resist Hurricanes .
So I crawled a relationship to an industrial fishing factory , learned about the size of their machines , and used a method to make spikes .
There was no language to translate this old , voluntary action into something that machines could make .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we hated the 4,500 bike web .
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now made , permanently and through translation had not lost .
( Applause ) This intersection had been boring and anonymous .
Now she had the character of a record .
I first got myself underneath .
When I watched the choreography of the wind unfolded , I felt protected and also connected to the endless sky .
My life wouldn &apos;t be the same anymore .
I want to create these sculptures in urban spaces all over the world .
I &apos;m going to talk about two directions that are new in my work .
The memorized city hall in Philadelphia : I felt this place needed a fabric for the sculpture that was easier than the web tissue .
So we experimented with small atomized water particles to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped by wind , and what it turns out is that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it and move around without being naked .
I use this formal material to record the pathways of the subway on the surface in real time — like a framework that reveals urban circulation systems .
The next challenge that American biennial asked in Denver if I could represent the 35 nations of Western hemisphere and their connectedness with each other in a sculpture .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to start , but I said yes .
I read about the last earthquake in Chile and the tsunamis that spread across the entire Pacific Ocean .
It disappeared the tectonic plates of the Earth , accelerated the eradication and literally destroyed the length of the day .
So I contacted NOAA and asked if they were to take their data out of the tsunamis , and I translated it into this form .
The title : &quot; &quot; 1,26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of Microsoft trials to shorter a peanut .
I couldn &apos;t build it with a steel ring , as I knew it .
His shape was now too complex .
So I &apos;m replacing the metal interior with a soft , fine tissue of fibers that were 15 times stronger than steel .
The sculpture could now be completely soft , so it was so light that it could be dowed at existing buildings — and literally became part of the tissue of the city .
There was no software that could produce these complex reforms and develop under consideration of gravity .
So we had to create one .
And then I got a phone call from New York City asking if I could fit these concepts for Time Square or the highline .
This new method for soft structures allows me to develop and build and build these sculptures in the size of skyscrapers .
They don &apos;t have any funding yet , but I dream now of bringing them to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
14 years ago , I was looking for beauty in the traditional things , in crafting forms .
Now , I &apos;m going to combine them with high-tech materials and engineering to create sippy , assembling forms in building size .
My artistic horizon is continuously expanding .
Let me conclude with this story .
I got a call from a friend from Phoenix .
A lawyer in an office who has never been interested in art , never visited the local museum , dragged , if possible , every one out of the building and made them go under the sculpture .
They lay in their business lies in the grass , watched the shifting patterns of the wind next to people they didn &apos;t know , and shared the rediscovery of the wonder .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Look at the horizontal axis after their age .
After puberty , we &apos;re at the minimum .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
But how did we do that ?
Let &apos;s look at the four fish we eat today .
A shell can filter more than 100 liters of water a day .
( Applause )
Create a woman . If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain .
It &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from each other , and I brought a real human brain to you .
Indeed . ( Laughter ) Our right hemisphere is all about this .
At the same time , through all our sensory systems , and then they explode in this enormous collage of what the current moment looks like , what this present moment smells and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like , and I &apos;m an energetic being that looks like with the energy around me .
By the awareness of my right hemisphere , we are energetic creatures that are human family .
My left hemisphere — our left hemisphere — is a very different place .
Our left hemisphere is linear and methodologic .
In our left-hemisphere .
It &apos;s the digestive brain cardboard that I and mine .
And I asked myself , &quot; &quot; What are you missing ?
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , my brain valley became .
All relationships to the outside world .
