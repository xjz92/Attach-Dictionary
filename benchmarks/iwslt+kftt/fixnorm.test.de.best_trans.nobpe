By the end of this year , there will be almost one billion people on this planet who actively use social networks .
What they all agree is they &apos;re going to die .
This seems like a morbid thought , but I think he provides some pretty profound implications that justify a naked view .
I think about it since I read a blog entry from Derek K. Miller this year , who was the science and technology journalist , who died of cancer .
And Miller brought his family and friends to write an entry that was published just after his death .
So here &apos;s the instruction .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s it , I &apos;m dead , and this is the last entry in my blog .
In advance , I asked them that once my body is finally the punishment of my cancer , my family and friends are publishing this proven message from me — as the first part of the process that makes an archive out of this active website . &quot; &quot; Now , while Miller wrote his archive better as a journalist , and carefully curated than most , it &apos;s about us all creating a archive today that was completely different from a generation .
A couple of numbers .
Just 48 hours of film uploaded to YouTube — minute !
200 million tweets are posted every day .
The average Facebook application produces 90 entries every month .
If you think about your parents or grandparents , at best they &apos;ve created some photos or home videos , or a journal that &apos;s cheating in a box .
But today , we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that will continue in the cloud forever , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think it creates some incredibly fascinating opportunities for technologists .
To make it clear , I &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so I want to design a sketch about what the present and the future will look like .
We &apos;re already seeing some of the records designed to allow us to decide what happens to our online samples and concerts in social media after we die .
One of them made me appropriate when I wrote about Foursquare in a Delhi restaurant in New York .
( Recording ) Adam Erow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : Death can gather you everywhere , at any time , in the biolades .
AO : Who is that ?
Death : Go to ivor.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Erow : Strange , right ?
What this offer is good , just said , it &apos;s going to let you design a message or a video that can be posted after your death on Facebook .
Another offer is called 1,000 memories .
And it makes you create a linear homage to your loved ones completely with photos and videos and stories that you can put online after you died .
But the next thing I find is far more interesting .
Many of you probably know Deb Roy , who showed in March how he could analyze more than 90,000 hours of private film records .
I believe that machines can get better access to human language , and increasingly process large amounts of data , it will be possible to analyze the benefits of a whole life — the tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog entries — that we produce in such incredible numbers .
And I think if that happens , it will be possible for our digital personality to interact with the real world for a long time with our aspects , thanks to the unmeasurable absence of content that we create , and the possibilities of technology to make sense of it .
We can already see experiments on this .
A supply called &quot; &quot; My Next Tweet , &quot; &quot; analyzes your entire Twitter Stream , everything you &apos;ve ever posted on Twitter , and then makes predictions of what you might say next .
Now , right now , as you see here , the results are kind of skyrol .
You can imagine what this looks like in five , 10 or 20 years with improved technological possibilities .
To take a step further , the Media Lab at MIT is working on robots that are similar to people .
But what if interactions could be based on the unique traits of a particular person on the basis of hundreds of thousands of ingredients that this person produced in their lives ?
Consider the very famous scene of electoral eight over here in the United States , when CNN projected a live hologram of the Hip-Hop-artist will.i.am in their studio , interview with Anderson Cooper .
What if we could use the same technology to get a representation of our loved ones into our living room — that interacts very close to life based on all the content they produced in their lifetime ?
I think that &apos;s going to be absolutely possible , because the amount of data that we use and the capability of technology to understand these are both growing exponentially .
Finally , I think we all have to think about whether we want that to become our reality — and if what it means for our idea of life and for everything that comes after that .
Thank you very much .

You can grab the ring , you can rush the bell out when the ride is at the end , you never know .
People tell you that one thing — make your life completely .
So you give your best and you land on the street .
Then you wake up one day and they tell you , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a queen . &quot; &quot; But then you realize someone else pulls the threads .
Crollercoaster Karussell .
Where the heights are heaven , but the depths are oh , they can be the hell .
Where the heights are heaven , but the depths are oh , they can be the hell .
Maybe I &apos;m just cynical , and all these words are lying , but the experience teaches me that the intention is .
But careful brings you to the hunters , and who hesitates , is lost , so your chances and never raise the price .

Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar technology industry .
And my little startup wants us to force ourselves to conservation by ...
... it paid attention to crowdsourcing .
Here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
Oh . A moment .
It may take you until it &apos;s invited .
( Laughter ) Now — we can just jump over this — I &apos;m just going to jump over the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
Oh , my time is over ?
Okay . Thank you .

It was on a afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
So I went to visit my colleagues Chris Hansen in his office .
Chris has been working on the ACLU for over 30 years , so he knew very well in our organization .
I just studied some cases in the tension field of science and civil rights — excitement .
But I found that the ACLU should do these topics much more basic to really change .
Chris asked me directly , &quot; What are the five most important topics that you &apos;re working on ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , patents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You tell me that the U.S. government spends patents on the parts of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be true . &quot; &quot; I went to my office and sent Chris three articles .
20 minutes later , he crashed into my office .
&quot; To God &apos;s will ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we sue ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Chris is a brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and nothing about genetics .
I knew a lot about genetics , but I was not a lawyer , let alone a patent attorney .
First , we had to understand exactly what was patented when somebody patented a gene .
Genpatents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of them is the so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — in fact , a piece of DNA that was taken from a cell .
And the patents didn &apos;t just form for certain isolated genes , but for all kinds of genes .
What does that mean ?
It also means that the patent owner can ban everyone to use the gene in the research or in clinical trials .
But the company became insoluble and never offered the test .
Genpatents were clearly a problem , and they were harming patients .
But was there a way to breed them ?
You can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
These things are too basic , they have to be free for everyone , and they have to stay ahead of anybody .
It occurred to us that the DNA , the basic structure of life , which is for the production of all our proteins , is both a product of nature and a natural law , whether it &apos;s in our body or in the test glass .
Most of us basically gave us right , at least theoretically legal .
Why is that ?
There were literally thousands of patents on the human genome .
We started working on our lawsuit .
We were looking for a patent owner who did his patents with all the power , and we created a broad alliance of claims and experts who could explain to the court about how these patents could harm patients and innovations .
The main candidate for a lawsuit was Myriad Genetics , a company in Salt Lake City in Utah .
Women with certain mutations on these genes have a much higher risk of breast cancer or ovarian cancer .
Clinic data was no longer shared with the international science community .
Probably most importantly , for several years , Myriad has refused to expand the test to add additional mutations that a team of researchers in France identified .
This is Kathleen Maxian .
Kathleens &apos;s sister , Eileen , at 40 years of breast cancer , Eileen was tested by Myriad .
The test was negative .
The family was relieved .
That meant that Eileens &apos;s cancer was probably not common , and other family members didn &apos;t need to be tested .
Kathlete &apos;s sister was under the 12 percent who received a false negative result .
If Eileen had gotten the right outcome , you would have tested Cathleen , your ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
One of the biggest challenges in preparation was how we best make the scientific standpoint .
In order to comprehend that Myriad did not make an invention , and that isolated BRCA genes were a product of nature , we had to explain a series of principles like , what is a gene ? What is DNA ?
How is DNA isolated , and why is it not an invention ?
You can patent the process of the gold rush , but never the gold itself .
Once the gold is won , it can be used for all of what it couldn &apos;t be used for in the mountain , for example , for jewelry — doesn &apos;t patent , it &apos;s still gold .
Now the year is 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to go .
Our text was good , but not as good as that .
How could he develop such a deep understanding of this trap ? In so short time ?
We just couldn &apos;t imagine that .
It got really exciting .
First of all , in a critical moment of the trial , the U.S. government changed the pages .
Now she was in opposition to her own patent official , and she declared , in fact , that the case was once more considered the judgment of the county county , and what they found was that isolated DNA was not paternable .
And we lost — in a sense .
The decision went two : one .
The two judge who agreed against us had very different reasons .
The first , Judge Lourie , invented his own new biological theory — completely wrong .
But she didn &apos;t want to terrify biotechnology industry , and the third judge , Bryson , agreed for us .
Now , we set in Revision on the Supreme Court .
And if you call the Supreme Court , you have to ask a question to answer the court .
Usually these questions have the form of super-long heels , about a page and a lot of side heels , &quot; which is this ... &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s why .
We may have asked the shortest question .
Four words : Are human genes paternable ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think it should be called &quot; &quot; Is isolated DNA paternable ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want the judges to act the same way I did when you told me the case seven years ago . &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t use anything about that .
Chris and I were sitting still at the aisle , and in some moments he would come in to represent the most important case of his career .
Also , three representatives of the Human Genome Project were in the room , including one of the discoverers of DNA itself , James Watson , who , in his case , was known as &quot; &quot; insanity . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of groups in this room and the contributions that each made to make this day come true , bands talked about the significance .
The disposition itself was compelling .
Chris argued brilliant .
Judge Kagan compared the case of isolated DNA with the exception of a recovery plant from the Amazon area .
Judge Roberts said it from cut .
In one of my most beautiful moments , Judge Sotomayor announced — ( Laughter ) In leaving the room , we were very optimistic , but we would never have predicted the result : nine : zero .
Some of them talked about a cheaper price than Myriad .
Some people put a better test in view than the one that Myriad offered .
But the decision goes far beyond myriad .
It adds an obstacle for medical discovery and innovation .
A few weeks after judgment , I got a little package with the mail .
It was from Bob Cook Deegan , a professor at Duke University , and one of the first people that Chris and I visited when we thought we should address the case .
And I opened it up , and I found a little stick animal .
What gave us the courage was the confidence to do the right thing .
It moved from the beginning to the end of almost eight years , with a lot of twists .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The second quote comes from the chairman .
Unfortunately , the answer to that is yes .
Then predictions can be made and tested .
What do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole thing is actually more than the sum of its parts .
Where are the economic networks ?
So what we looked at is property networks .
And we &apos;re adding value to the company .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies doing more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
Let me explain it with this analogy .
Hello . Today , I &apos;m going to give you insights in eight of my projects that were created in collaboration with the Danish artist , Sr Pors .
We call ourselves Pors &amp; Rao , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle fon . &quot; &quot; It was inspired by my uncle &apos;s marker to always ask me to do things for him , as if I was an extension of his body — turn on the lights or bring him a glass of water , get a package of cigarettes .
When I grew up , it became worse and worse , and I felt it was a kind of control .
I could never say anything , of course , because an uncle is a respectant in Indian families .
What amazed me most was his way of telephony on the grid .
He stopped the listener , and he expected me to vote for him .
As an answer and as a gift for my uncle , I created &quot; &quot; The Uncle Fon &quot; &quot; for him . It &apos;s so long that it has to be used by two people .
Just like my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s thought for a person .
But the problem is , when I went home and went to college , his orders were missing me .
So I built him a golden typewriter where he could type his commands to send them to his nephews and nieces as an email .
He had to put a piece of paper , type in his email or commands and pull the paper out .
The machine would automatically send the letter as an email to the person who &apos;s coming .
Here you can see that we built a lot of electronics that translates all the mechanical commands into digital commands .
My uncle only serves a mechanical interface .
And also , the object had to be very big , and sort of ritual , just like my uncle likes it .
The next work is a scrutiny installation that we aimed in &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; We wanted to convey the impression of being surrounded by a hormone very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So we have these panels on the wall , and behind that , the little creatures hide .
Once it gets quiet , they get out .
If it gets more stilled , they spin their halves .
But in the smallest sound , they &apos;re gone again .
We had the panels on three walls of the room .
And over 500 Pygmies hiding behind it .
And this is how it works .
This is a video of the prototype .
If it &apos;s silent , they appear .
And they hear — like humans or other real creatures .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re going to become immune to sound they &apos;re scaring .
And they don &apos;t respond to backgrounds .
You &apos;re about to hear a train that they don &apos;t respond to .
( Singing ) But they &apos;re responding to sound in the foreground — as you hear in a minute .
( Whistling ) We worked hard to make them as alive as possible .
Every Pygmy has its own behavior , its own psyche , mood variation , personality and so on .
This is a very early prototype .
Later it got better and better .
We left them react to people , and we found that people went around very playful and kindly with them .
This video installation is called &quot; &quot; The Lord Person . &quot; &quot; We were very excited to play with the idea of invisibility .
How could you develop the sense of invisibility ?
So we worked with a company that specialized on surveillance technology , and we asked them to develop software for a camera that recognizes people in the room , following them , and replacing a person through the background , which is invisible .
I &apos;m going to show you a very early prototype .
On the right , you can see my colleagues listening , who &apos;s really in the room .
And on the left you see the processed video where the camera makes it invisible .
Listen to the room and — Puff — he &apos;s gone .
You can see the camera is following him and shooting him out .
It &apos;s a earliest video , so we haven &apos;t got the overlapping and the rest yet in handle , but it &apos;s been refined soon .
So we used a camera taking the room and putting a monitor on every wall .
When people entered the room , they saw themselves in the monitors — just with a difference : one person was constantly invisible , wherever it was moving in the room .
This is what we call &quot; &quot; The Sunshine . &quot; &quot; It was like a piece of paper , a trained child &apos;s drawing of desolate oil or a sun .
From the front , this object worked strong and robust , but from the side it was very weak .
In the concrete room , people almost ignored it , and they thought it was a trash that was lying around .
But as soon as they passed , it started to bounce up the wall .
Over and over again , it broke apart .
( Laughter ) This work is the cartoon of a turned person .
His head is so hard , full of heavy thoughts that he &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat where his body is emported from a bladder .
It moves around his head in a very drunk way with unpredictable , very slow motion .
It &apos;s being restricted by this circle .
If the circle in a flat ground wasn &apos;t there , it would go through the room .
There are no wires .
I &apos;m going to show you an example : when people enter the room , they activate the object .
Very slowly , during a few minutes , it &apos;s almost painful and then wins pig , and it acts as if it was going to crash .
This is a very important moment , because we wanted to create a need for the viewer to help this creature save it .
It doesn &apos;t need that , because it &apos;s rebuilding itself .
This work was a technological challenge for us , and we &apos;ve been working hard for several years to get the mechanics , the balance and the dynamics .
And it was very important for us to get the point where it falls , because if it could overcome , it would also hurt , and it wouldn &apos;t fall enough to do that fatalism , so the need to help him .
I &apos;m going to show you a quick video now , when we stole it — it went much faster .
Here &apos;s my colleague . He let it go .
Now he gets nervous and he wants to catch it .
But it doesn &apos;t have to do that , because it &apos;s coming up all by itself .
In this work , we &apos;ve been very fascinated to work with the aesthetic of a model where thousands of tiny , different , optical cables are embedded like a starlight sky .
It has the framework of the night sky .
We wrapped it around this bladder shape of a teddy bear hanging off the ceiling .
The idea was to show something very calm , far apart and abstraction like space in the known form of a teddy bear , which is very calm and familiar .
And at some point , you should stop looking at the Teddyform , but almost as a space hole as if you look out in the night sky .
This is the last one — unfinished — work , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Spacial Operators . &quot; &quot; Imagine a cube about the size of a cube standing in front of you in the middle of a room , and the one who wants to shy you when you approach you by getting to a cube twice the height and the four-fold volume . &#91; Anmid &#93; : 2 ^ 3 .
This object grows or shrinks all the time to create a dynamics around it , almost like trying to hide .
We &apos;ve been working with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t like technology particularly , because it has always given us difficulty over and over again .
But we use them because we want to figure out how to help us express emotions and behaviors from these creatures that we build .
As soon as a creature comes up with almost a creation process where we can figure out how to live with the creature , what shape it wants to have , and how it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
It takes all life to survive .
Could it have been right at a different point ?
I love the Internet .
Really .
Think about all the things that it has brought us .
Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the businesses , all the trade .
And it &apos;s happening now , in our lifetime .
I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ll one day write history books in a few hundred years , and then you &apos;ll remember our generation when the generation that went online , the generation that really created something global .
But it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , security problems and privacy issues .
I spend my career fighting these problems .
Let me show you something .
This is Brain .
This is a data disk — a 130 foot disk , infected with Brain.A.
It &apos;s the first virus we found for PCs .
And we also know where Brain came from .
We know it because it &apos;s in the code .
Let &apos;s take a look inside .
All right .
This is the board director of an infected disk , and if we take a little more accurate look into it , we see that this is written here , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dark . &quot; &quot; And then it goes on with 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
And base and Amjad are the names , Pakistani names .
There &apos;s even a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) So 1986 .
Now we have the year 2011 .
That was 25 years ago .
The problem of PC-viruses is now 25 years old .
Half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
Let &apos;s see , here are some photos I took in Pakistan .
Here you see the city of Lahore , which is about 300 miles south of Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the road , or the path that leads to this building , the block of 730 Nizam in Allama Iqbal Town .
And I knocked on the door .
( Laughter ) And do you want to guess who opened the door ?
Basite and Amjad ; they still live there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is Basit .
And behind that , his brother , Amjad .
These are the men who wrote the first PC virus .
Of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked her why .
I asked her what they thought of what they started .
And I found it quite satisfying to find that the computer had been infected both men over the years with dozens of viruses .
So there &apos;s a kind of justice in the world .
Now , the viruses that we saw in the 1980s and 1990s are obviously not a problem .
Let me just show you a few examples of what they looked like .
What I &apos;m using here is a system that allows me to perform old programs on a modern computer .
So let me just put a couple of treadmill here . Look over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
Let me do some viruses on my computer .
So for example , let &apos;s first look at the centipede virus .
We can see in the upper half of the screen there &apos;s a thousandfold running across the computer when it &apos;s infected with this virus .
You know that you have a virus infection because it actually makes you realize .
Here &apos;s another one . This virus is called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one that makes a sound .
( Siren ) And the last example , guess what the forest virus does .
Right , you see a man walking across the screen when the computer is infected .
So it was very easy to see if you had a virus infection when the viruses were written by basters and teenagers .
Today , they &apos;re no longer written by Basters and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
Here in the back , we see an example of our system that we use in our labs where we pursue viral infections around the world .
We can actually see in real time that we just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
If I put a connection with our lab systems on the Web , in real time , we can get a sense of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every day .
Here &apos;s the latest virus we found in a file called Server.exe.
And we found it over there three seconds ago — before six seconds ago .
And when we scroll around , it &apos;s just overwhelming .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And these are just the last 20 minutes of malware on every single day .
So where do these viruses come from ?
Well , today there are organized crime banks writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
It &apos;s folks like — let &apos;s call up Gangstacks.com .
This is a website that operates in Moscow where these people buy infected computers .
So if you write viruses and you &apos;re able to infect Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with it , then you can sell these infected computers from other people — to these people .
And they actually pay money for these computers .
So how do these people then make money with these infected computers ?
Well , there are different ways , like banking Trojans stealing money from concerts when you use online banking , or keyggers .
Keylogger was silent and silent in the computer , well hidden , recording everything you tilt .
So they &apos;re sitting on the computer , for example , looking for something with Google .
Every single Google search you &apos;re doing is stored and transmitted to criminals .
Every single email you write is stored and sent to criminals .
The same with every single password and so on .
But what they &apos;re looking for is the sessions where you go online and buy things in any online store .
Because if you buy stuff in online stores , you type in your name , your supply address , your credit card number and the test number of your credit card .
And here &apos;s an example of a file that we found a few weeks ago on a server .
This is the credit card number , this is the waste date , this is the card test number , and this is the name of the credit card owner .
Once you have access to the credit card information of other people , you can just go online and buy what you want with this information .
And that is , obviously , a problem .
We now have a whole market and a business system underground , which is online crime .
One example of how these people can make money with their operations , and we &apos;re looking at the pages of INTERPOL , and we &apos;re looking at them looking for thoughtful people .
We &apos;re hitting men like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his comedy , also on the sides of INTERPOL , Mr. Shaileshmer Jain , a U.S. citizen .
These men conducted an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercriminal operation that they used to prevent millions .
They &apos;re both on the flight right now .
Nobody knows where they are .
U.S.-officials announced a Swiss bank account a few weeks ago that Mr. Jain heard , and on this bank account there were 14.9 million U.S. dollars .
So the wealth that &apos;s creating online crime is considerable .
And that means that online criminals can afford to invest in their attacks .
We know that online criminals hire programmers and people who test their code and have back end systems with SQL-databases .
And they can afford to watch how we work — how security people work — and try to figure out a way to deal with the security decisions that we meet .
They also use the global character of the Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why you call it the Internet .
And if you look at what happens in the online world , here &apos;s a video of Clarified Networks that illustrates how a single Malware-family can move around the world .
This surgery that you take , which it has its origin in in Estonia , goes from one country to the next time it &apos;s trying to keep the website quiet .
So you can &apos;t stop these people .
They move from one country to another , from one courthouse to the next — move around the world and exploit the fact that we &apos;re not able to track operations like this globally .
So through the Internet , it &apos;s as if you gave free airtickets to all the online criminals in the world .
Criminals that used to be able to reach us can now .
So how do you find online criminals ?
How do you feel them ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is an exploit .
Here you see the hexdump of a sculpture containing an exploit .
And what that means is , if you try to open this image on your Windows computer , it takes control over your computer , and it takes a code out of it .
Now , if you look at this image — well , here &apos;s the Header of the picture , and that &apos;s where the actual code of the attack begins .
And this code was encrypted , so let &apos;s decode it .
He would encrypted with XOR action 97 .
You just have to believe this , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true .
And we can go here and start to decode it .
The yellow part of the code is now encrypted .
And I know it actually doesn &apos;t look much different than the original .
But keep staring at it .
You &apos;ll notice that you can see an Internet address down there : unionseek.com / ioo.exe , and if you open this sculpture on your computer , this program is downloaded and executed .
And this is the back door that your computer is adopted about .
But more interestingly , if we continue to decode , we find this mysterious sequence of O6,KO78RUS .
This code is under encryption as a kind of signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I looked at this and tried to figure out what it means .
And of course , I Googled after that .
I got zero hits ; there was no .
So I talked to people from the lab .
And we have some Russian employees in our lab , and one of them said , well , it ends up in rus like Russia .
And 78 is the urban code for St. Petersburg .
You can find it in phone numbers , for example , in car detectors and hunters .
So I was looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and after a long quest , we finally found this particular website .
Here &apos;s this Russian that &apos;s been active online for a few years , and has his own website and has a blog on the popular Live Journal .
And in this blog , he writes about his life , his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s beginning 20 — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a very beautiful car .
In fact , he &apos;s driving a Mercedes Benz S600 V12 with a 6-liter engine and more than 400 PS .
This is a pretty amazing car for a man in the beginning of 20 who lives in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he wrote about it in his blog .
He had a car accident .
In the inner city of St. Petersburg , he was driving his car into another car .
And he posted pictures of the crash in his blog — this is his Mercedes — here &apos;s the Lada Samara that he drove in .
And you can see that the number sign of the Samara ends with 78RUS .
And if you look closer at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the marker of the Mercedes O600KO78RUS is .
Well , I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I were , then I would say at this point , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the case closed . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What happens when online criminals are cut ?
Well , in most cases , it &apos;s not that far .
In most of the cases of all online crimes , we don &apos;t even know which continent is going to attack .
And even if we can detect online criminals , in many cases there &apos;s no outcome .
The local police don &apos;t interact , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence or we can &apos;t hold them accountable for other reasons .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it &apos;s not .
But things are changing very rapidly .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
If you look at what Stuxnet did , you can see that it &apos;s infected these devices here .
This is a Siemens S7-400 PLC , a programmable logist controller .
And that &apos;s what controls our infrastructure .
This is what controls everything around us .
PLCs , these little devices that don &apos;t have a display , no keyboard that &apos;s programmed , are set up and do their job .
For example , the elevators in this building are highly controlled by one of these devices .
And if Stuxnet infects one of them , there &apos;s a huge revolution in terms of the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
Because all around us is controlled by these devices .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Go to a factory , a power plant , any chemical plant , any food factory , and look around — everything we control from these devices .
We &apos;re all controlled by computers .
Everything depends on the fact that these computers work .
We are now very dependent on the Internet , on fundamental things like electricity , of course , from working computers .
And this is really something that gives us a whole new problem .
We have to find any way to ensure that everything is going on , even though the computers are falling out .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Ready means that we can also do things if we don &apos;t have the things we take for granted .
And there are very basic things — considerations in terms of continuity , backing Ups , in terms of the things that are really important .
Well , I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . Really .
Think about the services that we have online .
Think about what happens when you &apos;re taken away , if you don &apos;t have them one day for some reason .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I worry that maybe we won &apos;t get this to the face .
I &apos;m worried that we &apos;re going to have problems because of online crime .
Online crime is the only thing that these things might take us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my whole life defending the web , and I think if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we &apos;re running danger of losing everything .
We need to do this globally , and we need to do it now .
What we need is more global , international collaboration in criminal fighting to get people out of online criminals — these organized individuals making millions of their attacks .
That &apos;s much more important than using anti-viral programs and firewalls .
What &apos;s really important is to find the people who are behind these attacks , and more importantly , we find the people who are about to be part of this world of online crime , but they &apos;re not yet .
We need to find the people who have the skills , but not the opportunities , and allow them to use their faiths for the good .
Thank you very much .

The world is changing at a remarkable speed .
If you look at the graph up there , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , according to this Goldman Sachs forecast , the Chinese economy will be almost as big as the American economy .
And if you look at the graph for 2050 , the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will have almost the same size as the American economy .
And we should keep in mind that these predictions were established before the economic crisis in the West .
A few weeks ago , I looked at the latest predictions of BNP Paribas on the question of when China is going to have a bigger economy than the United States .
Goldman Sachs predicted 2027 .
The post-crisis prediction is 2020 .
This is in just a decade .
China is going to change the world in terms of two basic aspects .
First of all , it &apos;s a huge development country with a population of 1.3 billion people that have been growing for over 30 years with a rate of about 10 percent a year .
And within a decade , the country will have the largest economy in the world .
Never before in the modern world , the largest economy in the world was the world &apos;s developing country rather than the developed world .
Secondly , and for the first time in the modern world , the dominant country in the world — what I think China will be — will not be from the West and with very , very different civilizational roots .
Now I know that it &apos;s a very common assumption in the West that countries that are modernizing are also Western .
This is an illusion .
It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is simply a product of competition , markets and technology .
It &apos;s not ; it &apos;s also determined by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will never be like the West .
It will remain very different in fundamental aspects .
Now the big question here is obviously : How can we understand China ?
How can we try to understand what China is ?
And the problem that we have in the West right now is that the conventional approach is that we really look at it under Western conditions using Western ideas .
We can &apos;t do that .
Now I want to offer you this : three building blocks to try to understand how China is — just as a launch .
The first is that China is not really a nation-state .
Okay , it described itself as a nation-state in the last hundred years , but anyone who knows anything about China knows that the country is much older .
This is what China looked like in the victory of Qin Dynasty in the year 221 B.C. , at the end of the time of the arguing empire — the birth of modern China .
And you can compare it to the limits of modern China .
Or right after that , the Han Dynasia , still 2,000 years ago .
And you can see , it stretches across what we now call echina , the area where most of the Chinese lived and lives today .
Now what &apos;s so extraordinary about this is that what China has got to understand is to be China , what Chinese gives their understanding of what it means to be Chinese , not in the last hundred years , not in the time of the nation-state , so what &apos;s happened in the West , but from a time when you like , the civilizational state .
I think , for example , about practices like hunting , of a very own notion of state , as well as a very own notion of family , social relations like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
These are all values that come from the time of civilization .
In other words , China , unlike Western states and most other countries around the world , is shaped by its understanding of civilization , its existence as a civilizational state , and not as a nation-state .
And there &apos;s another thing to add , and this is the following : of course , we know that China is large , large , demographic and geographical , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we &apos;re often not really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
You can &apos;t just control a country of such size from Beijing , even though we often think that &apos;s the case .
It never happened .
So this is China , a civilization state , not so much a nation-state .
And what does that mean ?
Well , I think that has all sorts of basic implications .
I &apos;ll give you two obvious ones .
The first is that the greatest political value for Chinese unit is the creation of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : collapse , the fragmentation of the sacred Roman Empire .
It divided , and it &apos;s been divided since then .
China , in the same period , the exact opposite path , under great pain , held this great civilization , the civilizations state together .
The second is perhaps a little sober , and this is Hong Kong .
Remember the return of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese proposed to as a constitution .
One country , two systems .
And I bet hardly anyone in the West believed them .
&quot; &quot; Oyewitness .
If China has Hong Kong , we don &apos;t agree anymore . &quot; &quot; 13 years later , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is exactly the same as it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , of course , in the sense of a nation-state .
Think about the German insight , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the east was swallowed from the West .
A nation , a system .
This is the mentality of the nation-state .
But you can &apos;t lead a country like China , a civilizational state , based on civilization , a system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
In fact , China &apos;s answer to the question of Hong Kong — just as it &apos;s going to be on the question of Taiwan — a natural answer : a civilization , many systems .
Let me introduce another building block to try to understand China — maybe a little less comfortable .
The Chinese have a very , very different notion of ethnie than most other countries .
You know , from the 1.3 billion Chinese people think about 90 percent that they belong to the same ethnic , the Han .
Well , this is completely different from the other highly populated countries in the world .
India , the United States — Indonesia , Brazil — all are multi-ethnic .
The Chinese see this differently .
China really is multi-ethnically only on the edges .
So the question is , why ?
Well , I think the reason is fundamentally , again , back to the civilizational state .
A story of at least 2,000 years , a story of epiphany , occupation , assimulation and so forth led to development , through which , over time , the idea of the han came — of course , fed by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
The great advantage of this historical experience is that without the Han China , China could never have survived .
The Han identity is the cement that the country held together .
The big news of this is that Han has a very small idea of cultural differences .
They really believe in their own bias , and they &apos;re very respectful to those who are not a han .
So for example , their behavior against the cigards and the Tibetans .
Or let me introduce you to my third building block , the Chinese state .
So , the relationship between the state and the society in China is very different from the West .
In the West , we seem to think mostly — at least today — that authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
The problem with this assumption is that the Chinese state is experiencing more legitimacy and more authority among the Chinese than it would be in any Western state .
And the reason for that is that — well , I think there are two reasons .
And of course , this has nothing to do with democracy , because after our imagination , the Chinese have no democracy .
And the reason for that is , first of all , the state in China gets a very special — enjoy a very special place than the representative , the embodiment and the hip of the Chinese civilization , the civilization state .
This is as close as China comes to a kind of spiritual role .
And the second reason is that while in Europe and North America , the power of the state is constantly questioned — I mean , in the European tradition , in history against the church , against other parts of the Aristocracy , against merchants and so forth — for a thousand years , the power of the Chinese state has not been asked .
He had no severe rivals .
So you can see that the way power was built in China is very different than our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that Chinese have a very different picture of the state .
While we tend to see him as an inventor , a stranger , certainly an organ whose power has to be limited or limited , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state at all .
The Chinese see the state as a trust — actually not only as a trustworthy , as a member of the family — actually not only as a member of the family , but as the leader of the family , the patriarch of the family .
This is the Chinese idea of the state — very , very different from ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society differently than the way it is in the West .
And I would suggest to you that what we actually have to do here in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm that is different than anything we had to think about in the past .
Be aware that China believes in the market and the state .
I mean , Adam Smith , who wrote in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is bigger and more advanced and nowhere than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , besides the Mao period , it stayed more or less the case until today .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
I mean , he runs companies , which many of us today are state ownership .
Private companies , no matter how big they are , like Lenovo , depend on many kinds of state governance .
Economic goals and so on are determined by the state .
And the state , of course , affects authority many other areas — as we know it — like one-child politics .
On top of that , it &apos;s a very old state abstraction , a very old tradition of state art .
I mean , if you want a representation , the Chinese wall is one .
But this is another one , this is the Kaisdeal , which was first started in the fifth century before Christ .
And finally , in the seventh century , it was finished after Christ .
It was 1972 miles long , connected Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary government infrastructure projects in China , which helps us explain what we see today , which is like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
So here we have three building blocks to try to understand the other thing that China is — the civilizations state , the concept of ethnie , and the kind of state and its relationship to society .
And yet , all of us are insisted to think that we can understand China by simply supporting Western experiences , looking at Western eyes , using Western concepts .
If you want to know why we inevitably understand China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen in China are wrong — that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I think I have to say that I think the attitude to China is one of the smallest Western mentality .
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think we are the best , and therefore we have the universal scale .
And second , it &apos;s ignorant .
We refuse to really address the subject of differences .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen argued that the West sees itself as probably the most cosmopolitical of all cultures .
But he &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most provincial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant worldwide that it wasn &apos;t really necessary to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because in the end , he can , without violence , without his will .
Behind those cultures — literally the rest of the world — who were in a much weaker position , vis-a-vis in the West , were forced to understand the West because of the presence of the West in those societies .
And so they are , as a result , in many ways cosmopolitical than the West .
I mean , look at the question of East Asia .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Today , the largest economic region in the world .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , the East Asians , people from East Asia , know much more about the West than the West over East Asia .
Now this aspect is very relevant , I &apos;m afraid , for the present .
Because what happens ? Back to the drawing from the beginning — the Goldman Sachs graph .
What happens is that , for historical terms , the world is driven and shaped , not by the old developed world , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 — that the G7 position quickly occurred — or the G8 .
And that has two consequences .
First , the West is rapidly losing its impact around the world .
By the way , a year ago , there was a dramatic example of this — Copenhagen , the climate change .
Europe did not sit with the final negotiation table .
When did that last ?
I would guess it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
And the second consequence is that the world is inevitable as a consequence of us becoming increasingly unfamiliar , because it &apos;s shaped by cultures and experiences and history that we don &apos;t really know or familiar with .
And finally , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe , America is a little bit different — but Europeans are , I have to say , largely ignorant , and not aware of how the world changes .
Some people — I have an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleeping into lunch . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe it &apos;s a hyperbole .
But there &apos;s another problem associated with this — that Europe is increasingly losing contact to the world — and that &apos;s a kind of loss of an idea from the future .
I mean , Europe once , of course , once commissioned the future in its fixed conviction .
Take , for example , the 19th century .
But fortunately , this is no longer true .
If you want to feel the future , if you want to try the future , try China — this is the old Confucius .
This is a railroad station , as you &apos;ve never seen one .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railroad station .
This is the new station in Guangzhou for high-speed trains .
China already has a bigger net than any other country in the world , and pretty soon it will have a bigger than all the other countries combined .
Or this : Now it &apos;s an idea , but this idea will soon be tried in a suburb by Beijing .
Here you have a megabus , on the top level , it &apos;s transported around 2,000 people .
It &apos;s going down a road in suburbs , and the cars are going underneath .
And it &apos;s accelerating at over 1,000 miles an hour .
So this is how things are going to evolve , because China has a very specific problem that is different from Europe and the United States , and China has a high population and no place .
So this is a solution to a situation where China will have many , many , many cities with more than 20 million people .
Okay , so how do I want to close ?
Now , how would our attitude be to this world that we see , how it evolves very quickly in front of our eyes ?
I think it will have good aspects , and it will have bad aspects .
But what I &apos;d like to do is introduce a whole picture that is positive for this world .
For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fraction of the world &apos;s population .
This is what Europe and North America represented .
The emergence of countries like China and India — the 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so forth , represents the most important act of democratization in the last 200 years .
Civiations and cultures that were ignored , who didn &apos;t have a linguistic real , who didn &apos;t listen to , who were unknown , will be replicated in the world .
As human beings , we definitely have to embrace this transformation , and we &apos;re going to need to learn about these civilizations .
This big ship here was that , with the Zheng Steven in the early 15th century , sailed on his big travels through the South China Sea , the East Chinese Sea , and through the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
The little boat before that is that , 80 years later , Christoph Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at these silkrolls of Zhu Zhou from the year 1368 .
I think they play golf .
My God , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
But before you tweak your gun , or start singing , or choosing your favorite color , I want to define revolution .
I think revolution is a radical and profound change in thinking and behavior — how we think and how we behave .
But why , Steve , do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because the situation here is so bad . Very bad .
And that makes me very sad because I have the nose full of the bad situation here .
I have the nose full of it that we don &apos;t use our entire potential .
I &apos;ve got the nose full that we &apos;re always in the last place .
And will be in the last place in many areas — for example , social conditions .
We are in the last place in Europe in the realm of innovation .
We are at the end of the table , in the last place as the culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
Our health care system is in the last place , and that &apos;s important for well-being .
We &apos;re not just in E.U. last place , but we &apos;re also in Europe — in the last place .
But the bad thing is what the Economist magazine reported three weeks ago , as you may have read .
We are the saddest nation in the world , relatively to GDP per person — the saddest country in the world .
This is in the social area , now we &apos;re looking at education .
What are we , three weeks ago , after another report of OECD ?
In the last place in reading , math and science , last .
The corporate area : the lowest attitude in E.U.
that entrepreneurs are making benefits to society .
Why is that , and what happened ?
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting a business .
And that &apos;s also , if everybody knows that small companies are the engine of the economy .
We have most employees , we produce most of the fees .
And when our engine is broken , what are the implications ?
The last place in Europe is about GDP per capita .
Last .
So it &apos;s not surprising that only 62 percent of the Bulgarians are optimistic about the future .
We &apos;re sad , we have bad education , and we have the weakest companies .
And these are the facts .
This is not a fairy tale , I don &apos;t phanize .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a conspiracy against Bulgaria . These are the facts .
So I think it &apos;s very clear that our system is broken .
As we think and behave , our behavior system is broken .
We need a profound change in thinking and behavior to turn Bulgaria into something better for us and for our friends , for our family and our future .
How did that happen ?
Let &apos;s be optimistic now . We &apos;re going to be optimistic . How did that happen ?
I think we &apos;re in the last place , because — and this is going to be awkward for some of you — because we &apos;re retreating ourselves .
We keep ourselves because we don &apos;t have the pleasure to play .
I said games .
If any of you can &apos;t remember what play is , that &apos;s play .
Babies play , children play , play adults .
We don &apos;t value play .
In fact , we &apos;re going to value games .
And we &apos;re going to throw it down into three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to those areas in history .
Social : 45 years of what ?
Communism — pay more attention to society and state than the individual and squeeze , deemed , creativity , the individual self-expression and innovation .
And instead , what do we put value on ?
It &apos;s known that the way we use knowledge , generalize and use it , is affected by our social and institutional context , which has taught us about communism ?
To be serious .
Really , being serious .
That &apos;s what happened .
( Applause ) Be serious .
I can &apos;t tell how many times I got vaccinated because I let my kids play on the ground .
God forbid that I let my kids play in the mud , or even in puddle , water , that will kill them .
I &apos;ve been advised by grandmothers and grandfathers that kids shouldn &apos;t play so much because life is serious , and they should be raised that life is serious .
We have a continuous meme — being serious .
This is a gene of society .
This is a serious gene .
It &apos;s existed for 45 years , and it caused the emergence of the grandmother factor . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And that &apos;s how it works .
Step one : A woman says , &quot; &quot; I want a baby . I want a baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : We get a baby . Woohoo !
But what will happen in the step three ?
I want to work again because I want to promote my cousins or just want to drink coffee .
I leave my baby with my grandmother .
But we need to remember that grandmother has been infected with the serious gene for 45 years .
What will happen ?
It continues to give the baby the virus , and it goes very , very , very much time — like the sequence — to remove this serious meme from our system .
What will happen then ?
It infects our educational system that has also been obsolete and hasn &apos;t been changed for 100 years , and estimates the amount of expenditure , exposure to standardization , and acquires self-expression and self-expression , self-exploration , excitement , creativity and play .
This system is broken .
A real story : I was looking for a school for my child .
We went to a rough little school , and we said , kids will learn math 10 times a week and learn science eight times a week and read five times a week and so on .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , but how about play and school cars ? &quot; &quot; And then they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . Not only a moment will they have that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s only five years old . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
And it &apos;s a crime that our educational system is so serious , because education is so serious that we produce wireless seats , robotic labor force is turning the balls in pre-dried holes .
But forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
We need adaptability to learn the ability to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need mechanized human labor .
But now our memes are working , where we don &apos;t value play .
We produce robotically engineered human labor , which we treat as an activity that we stemmed and then we throw away .
How do you describe the work in Bulgaria ?
Autocratic — Make what I say because I &apos;m the boss .
I &apos;m the boss , and I know I &apos;m better than you .
Misstraugic — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I install surveillance cameras .
( Laughter ) Impressive — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I do a lot of little processes for you to follow and not shatter .
So they &apos;re constraints — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t browse on the Internet , isn &apos;t in the I.M.
That &apos;s kind of unprofessional and bad .
And at the end of the day , there &apos;s no fulfillment , because you &apos;re intended , restricted and not reviewed , and that &apos;s not fun .
In society , in education and in our business , we don &apos;t value play .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re in the last place because we don &apos;t value play .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s nonsense , Steve . It &apos;s a stupid idea .
It can &apos;t be , just because of the game .
Just playing is a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have this genuine meme inside us .
I &apos;m not going to say no .
And I &apos;m going to prove this to you in the following part of this talk — that play is the catalyst , the revolution , and we can use it to transform Bulgaria to the better .
Play : Our brains are programmed to play .
Evolution has selected it , millions and cheap years before , for animals and humans .
And you know what ?
Evolution does it very , very well , in the general election of properties that are not present to us , and in the election of properties that are powerful and prevalent .
Nature is not stupid and has chosen play .
All over the animal world , for example , ants , play ants .
Maybe you didn &apos;t know .
But when they play , they learn the rules of society and the dynamics of things .
Rats play , but maybe you didn &apos;t know that rats who played more have bigger brains , and they learn tasks better than they do .
Ken play . We all know that kittens play .
But what they may not know is that kittens that didn &apos;t play are socially weak .
They can chase , but they don &apos;t have social skills .
Bars play .
But what you may not know is that bears that played more live longer .
Not the bears that learned better to fish .
The bears that played more .
And the last study that was published shows a correlation between play and the size of the brain .
The more you play , the bigger your brain is .
Now , dolphins that have very large brains play a lot .
But who do you think is the biggest player with the largest brain ?
Yes , exactly , people .
Children play , we play — people of all nationalities , all races , all colors , all religions .
It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
And not just the children , adults .
A very good term : neoteny — the delivery of play and juvenile features in adults .
And who are the largest neotenists ?
People . We play sports .
We play for fun or as an Olympic , or as a professional athlete .
We play music instruments .
We dance , kissing , sing , bumbling .
We &apos;ve programmed from nature to play before we were born to the high age .
We &apos;re programmed to do this all the time — play and play a lot and not stop playing .
That &apos;s a big advantage .
Just as there is an advantage for the animals , there is an advantage for the people .
For example , it &apos;s known that play stimulates neurons in the Amygdala , in the part where emotion is controlled .
It &apos;s known that play in prefrontal cortex promotes development where a lot of cognitive emerges .
And what is the result ?
We develop more emotional wealth if we play more .
We develop better decision-making if we play more .
These are the facts .
This is not fiction , no fairy tale , no fantasy ; it &apos;s insensitive , sharp science .
There are benefits in play .
It &apos;s a genetic birthday that belongs to us , just like walking or talking or seeing .
And if we disengage ourselves with play , we dislike we disengage every other birthday we have .
We &apos;re holding back .
Just a small task for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine the world without play .
Imagine the world without theater , without art , without love , without dancing , without football , without football , without football .
What will this world look like ?
It &apos;s very dry .
It &apos;s very expressed .
Now imagine their workplace .
Is it funny in your workplace , playful ?
Or maybe the workplace of your friends — we think forward .
Is it funny , playful there ?
Or is it not ? Is it autocratic , relaxing , constraining and miserable and without fulfilling ?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
We even feel guilty when we see ourselves playing in the workplace .
&quot; &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laugh . Obviously I don &apos;t have enough work to do , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I should hide myself because my boss could see me .
He &apos;s going to suspect I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have a message for you : Your thinking is backwards .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play .
It &apos;s depression , it &apos;s depression .
In fact , play improves our work .
Just as there are benefits for people and animals , there are also benefits to work .
For example , it stimulates creativity .
It enhances our liberation to change .
It enhances our ability to learn .
And gives us a sense of purpose and mastery — two essential motivating things that reinforce our capacity through play .
But before you think play is not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean something frightening .
You know , the professional athlete that Ski likes is serious about it , but he likes it .
He finds it funny , he feels fantastic , he makes everything perfect .
A doctor can be serious , but laughter is a great medicine .
Our thinking is backwards .
We &apos;re not supposed to feel final .
We &apos;re supposed to celebrate play .
Let me give you a quick example from the corporate world .
FedEx , simple motto : people , service , profit .
If you treat your employees like people , great treatment , they &apos;re happier , they have fulfillment , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
And then what will happen ? They will give better services — not worse , but better .
And when the customers call for services and talk to happy employees who can make decisions and have the fulfillment , how will the customers feel ? They will feel happy .
And what will the happy customers do that feel very happy ?
They &apos;re going to buy more of your services , and they &apos;re going to share more of their friends , and that means greater profit .
People , services , profits .
Play increases capacity , it doesn &apos;t determine them .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Man , this works for FedEx in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria at all .
No opportunity . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It works in Bulgaria as well . Two reasons .
First , play is universal .
There &apos;s nothing special about the Bulgars that keeps them from playing , besides the serious memes that we &apos;re supposed to throw out .
Second , I tried it . I tried it in the company Sciant .
When I started working in this company , there were no satisfied customers .
No client wanted to recommend us .
I asked all the clients .
We had a minimum profit . I also had .
We had a minimum profit , and unsatisfied steel donors .
Through a cross-changing change , change , like transparency , change , such as self-control , and collaboration , collaboration , and not autocracy , these things are focused on results .
It doesn &apos;t matter when you get home in the morning . It doesn &apos;t matter when you go home .
It &apos;s important to me that your customer and your working group are happy , and you &apos;re organized for that .
Why should I care if you &apos;re coming at nine o &apos;clock ?
Basically , to foster fun .
Through funding fun and fun environments , it was possible for us to turn science , and only after three short years — it sounds like a very long time , but the change is slow — every customer , from none of us to the clients , to recommend more gain than the average profit in our industry , and satisfied traffic jams .
But you can say , &quot; &quot; How can you say they &apos;re satisfied ? &quot; &quot; We won every year , and they &apos;ve been set up on the list of the best small entrepreneurial employers .
Independent expenditure of anonymous workers in the polls .
So , it works , and it can work here in Bulgaria .
Nothing keeps us back except for our own mentality about play .
Some steps that we can do — at the end — to be able to create this revolution through play .
First , you should believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , you go home and think about it for a while or something else .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t have a sense of play , then you should rediscover play .
Whatever you &apos;ve enjoyed as a child you &apos;ve enjoyed before six months , but now you &apos;ve gotten the ascent , you can &apos;t enjoy it , because you feel you &apos;re supposed to be serious , you discover it .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s mountain bike or reading a book or playing a game .
You rediscover it . Because you &apos;re the leaders who are innovation leaders who are the master of ideas .
You &apos;re those who should go back to your service , or talk to your friends , and start the fire to change in the game revolution .
You should do that because if you don &apos;t feel that , your colleagues , employees won &apos;t feel it either .
You should go back and say , &quot; &quot; Listen , I &apos;ll trust you . &quot; &quot; A strange concept . I hired you . I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to make you powerful . I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level of my company , not just the highest .
I &apos;m going to promote constructive criticism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge the authority .
Because just the challenge is the only way that things are always done , the only way for us to get rid of the old junk and find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
We &apos;re going to beat fear .
Fear is the enemy of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminating constraints , for example .
You know what , let them use their cell phones for private conversations — God heated .
Let &apos;s surf them on the Internet .
Let them be in Chat .
Let them have lunch for a long time .
lunch is like vacation from work .
It &apos;s time when you go out into the world , and your brain invite , meet friends , drink a beer , eat something , talk , and then you get synergy of ideas that you never had before .
Let them do that . Give them some freedom , and the most important thing is , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
We spend a lot of time in our lives at the workplace , and the job is to be what ? A sad torture ? After 20 years , you &apos;re going to wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this all ?
Is this all and nothing more ? &quot; &quot; Not acceptable . Nepriemliv .
( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a profound change in our thinking and behavior , but we don &apos;t need a revolution of employees .
We don &apos;t need a revolution of employees .
What we need is a record of the players , and what we need is a record of the players , and what we need is a record of the players .
Really seriously , we should be together . Today the beginning is supposed to take place from the emergency , but what you &apos;re supposed to do is design the fire of the revolution . You &apos;re supposed to share your ideas and success stories .
What worked and our lives , our schools , and our work has revived through play , how play promotes a sense of promise and self-actuation , how play promotes innovation and productivity , and ultimately how play makes sense .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We should do it together , and if we do that , and share the ideas of play , we can transform Bulgaria into something better .
Thank you .

I want to start by showing you a free one , and that &apos;s what you just need to do : change your body position for two minutes .
But before I go on , I want to ask you to briefly check your body and think about how you use it .
How many of you make yourself smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we stretch out . ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to be aware of what you &apos;re doing right now .
We are very fascinated by our body language , and particularly by the language we have .
You know , we &apos;re interested in — ( Laughter ) — an awkward touch or a smile or a disturbing view , or maybe a rather awkward stroke , or maybe even something like a benchmark .
Narrator : Now they come to number 10 , and look at this .
Even in the BBC and the New York Times .
So if we think about non-verbal behavior or body language , what social scientists call social scientists , it &apos;s about language . So we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
There are many reasons for looking at this .
We &apos;re cutting out pause juggling and returning because of body language .
These judgments can affect critical life situations , whether we hire or foster or who we &apos;re going to talk to for a date .
Nalini Ambady , a scientist at Tufts University , for example , showed that if people watch a video clip for 30 seconds without any audio on real medical interactions , their judgment of the physician &apos;s friendship predicts whether the doctor is sued or not .
If they &apos;re insent , that &apos;s a bad idea . Right ?
We are influenced by our own non-verbal actions , our thoughts , our feelings and our physiology .
What nonverbal actions do I talk about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitably that I started interested in power .
I was particularly interested in the non-verbal expressions of power and dominance .
What are these non-verbal expressions of power and dominance ?
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s about growing and making bigger .
You go big , you stretch , you take space , you open up .
It &apos;s all about opening up .
This expression , also known as pride , was studied by Jessica Tracy . It showed up .
We &apos;re small . We don &apos;t want to be touched by the person next to us .
That &apos;s what happens when you have a lot of power .
When we face somebody with a lot of power , we make us smaller . We don &apos;t reflect their behavior .
I get this behavior in class , and what do I find ? I notice that MBA students .
When they sit down , they stretch out .
Other people in their present literally fall together when they enter the room , and you see it as soon as they come in .
I &apos;ve noticed a few things about this .
Women operate much more often than men .
Women are feeling less powerful all the time than men , so that &apos;s not surprising , but I also noticed .
This is very important in terms of the MBA class , because participation in education is half the notes .
In Business Schools , this sex and particular approach is a problem .
So I thought about it . You meet these people and you see it .
There is evidence that it is .
We laugh , for example , if we &apos;re happy , but even if we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in between the teeth , it makes us happy .
So it goes both ways . In terms of power .
The second question was , if we know that our consciousness affects our bodies , can our bodies change our consciousness ?
When I say in terms of power , what do I mean by that ?
What &apos;s the mind of a human being compared to that ?
People with power tend to think that &apos;s not a surprise to be more confident and more optimistic .
Even when they &apos;re lucky , they think they can win .
There are many differences . They take more risks .
But power is also about how to respond to stress .
So do you want the dominant leadership with a lot of power , high testosterone level , but without stress resistance ?
Probably not , right ? You want the person .
So we have evidence that the body can influence consciousness , at least in the facial area , and that the same is also achieved by a role-change .
What happens in a role-change , what happens when it takes place at the very smallest level ? How the following little manipulation , that tiny equation ?
Here are some more .
So you can stand or sit .
So here are the bottom line of power .
You fall together , you make small .
When you touch your neck , you touch your neck .
So that &apos;s what happens . They enter the room .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s how the whole experiment goes .
Here are our results for testosterone .
Again , these changes happened within two minutes .
In terms of Cortisol , we see this : people with a lot of power .
It seems that our non-verbal actions affect us , so it &apos;s not just the others , but also us .
Our bodies change our consciousness .
So we think it &apos;s important in situations like social situations that create discomfort in which you &apos;re judged .
This is not about you talking to other people like this .
It &apos;s about how you talk to yourself . What do you do ?
We wanted to check that . Okay ?
It takes five minutes and it &apos;s recorded .
For five minutes , nothing . That &apos;s worse than being taken into the tent .
People hate this . Marianne LaFrance calls this .
And then four programmers look at the records .
You don &apos;t know the hypothesis . You don &apos;t know the conditions .
It &apos;s about the presence they put on the day .
These are things like this . People sort of show their true me .
That affects the outcome or convey it .
So I suggested : deception until you do it ! No , that &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to achieve something , and then feel like a cheer .
I don &apos;t want to be a holiday .
When I was 19 , I had a very heavy car accident .
I was blogged out of the car , and I used to beat myself several times .
I was blogged out of the car . I woke up with a headrest .
I knew my IQ because intelligence was important to me , and I had been considered highly gifted as a child .
So I was no longer in college , trying to return .
They said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to make your degree .
It &apos;s like a cheetah .
You &apos;re going to stay and do this .
I have it inside . I really do it . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s exactly what I did . Five years of graduate school .
I don &apos;t feel like that anymore , but she did , and I could understand that .
She can fake it , and she can become it .
So it has changed .
So I want to tell you , don &apos;t pretend to do it until you do it .
You fake it until you get it . You know ?
Keep on until you actually get it and internalize it .
I want to end with the following .
Small modifications can lead to big changes .
That &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
You should do that . Put your brain on it .
Shut your testosterone level . Put your Cortisollevel .
Don &apos;t come with a feeling that you couldn &apos;t show who you really are .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Big affection . In hard times , we need great affection .
Talk . Great affection is amazing , absurd , rational , irrational , irrational .
Great affection can spread tolerance and apply to freedom , to education as an ingenious idea .
( Laughter ) Great grip can flip a light on men , or show that a lack doesn &apos;t have to be any .
Great affection can make politicians electable , or parties can be unelectable .
It can make war look like a tragedy or a farce .
Screw force is the mimic that prints headwords on our T-shirt and puts sparks on our lips .
It &apos;s the caregiver that gives us the simple road through an imperative moral thickness .
Science is smart , but great affection is a little less familiar , but it &apos;s so ambitious , and what we need now is magic .
These are emergencies .
Our climate is changing fast , too fast .
And great affordability is needed to do what it does so well : to stack , to think differently , to calculate dramatically .
We &apos;re willing to commit to behave differently with rich creative interfaces .
And this is such a piece of replacement from an initiative where I participate in order to get people creatively excited .
Video : Man : Oh , you know , I &apos;m not going to drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
Narrator : So he went to his foot , and he saw things running .
Strange and wonderful things he wouldn &apos;t have seen otherwise .
A deer with a jeweling leg . A flying motorcycle .
Father and daughter separated by a mysterious wall from a bicycle .
And then he stopped . Before him , she walked .
The woman who had been traveling through fields as a child , had broken his heart .
Sure , she was a little older now .
Yes , actually much older .
But he felt his old passion for her to return .
&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he said soft . That was her name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say anything more , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , because that was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a trailer , exactly 300 yards from here .
Let &apos;s go and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford moved out . She got a leg , and then the other one .
Gusty leapfrogged into her and made rythmic love with her while she was filming him because she was a dedicated amateur pornography .
The Earth was moving for both .
And they lived happily together forever .
And that &apos;s because he went to his foot that day .
( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We have the science , we had the argument .
The moral commandment is on the table .
Big affirmation is required to do everything , simple and incrementally .
It &apos;s all about connecting people to make action .
So this is a call , an apple , to the Incredible talented TED community .
Let &apos;s face climate change creatively .
And that &apos;s quick . Thank you .
( Applause )
Beau Lotto : So , the game is very simple .
You just have to read what you see . All right ?
I count for you , then we don &apos;t have to do that all together .
One , two , three . Audience : Can you read that ?
BL : Amazing . What about it ? One , two , three audience : You don &apos;t read that .
BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) Maybe Portuguese . And that ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
BL : What are you reading ? There are no words .
I said , read what you see , right ?
In fact , it says , &quot; &quot; Wa , Mary ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
You should have said that , right ? How does that happen ?
Because perception is based on our experience .
The brain takes meaningless information and makes it clear , which means we never see what &apos;s there . We never see the information , just what made sense in the past .
That means that in our perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s about getting information . It generates useful behavior . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Oh , ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : If it doesn &apos;t work the way we &apos;d like it , we &apos;re angry , right ?
But I &apos;m talking about perception here .
And perception underpins everything we think , our hopes , our dreams , our clothes , to be in love , everything begins with perception .
When perception is based on our history , that means we &apos;re just responding to something we &apos;ve done before .
But that creates a huge problem , because how should we ever see something different ?
I want to tell you a story about &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; and each new perception begins in a moment .
It starts with a question .
The problem with questions is that they create uncertainty .
Uncertainty is a bad thing , evolutionarily . If you &apos;re not sure this is an enemy , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even sea disease is based on uncertainty .
The bottom deck tells you the inner ear , you &apos;re moving , but the eyes are moving in the entrance with the boat , saying , &quot; I &apos;m standing still . &quot;
The brain cannot process the uncertainty and will get sick .
The question of why is very dangerous because it makes you uncertain .
The irony of that is that we can only do something new if we &apos;re going to take that step .
How can we ever do something new ? Luckily , evolution has the answer for us .
It enables us to ask the most difficult questions , the best questions are the ones that create the largest uncertainty .
These are the ones that question our truth .
It &apos;s easy to ask for the origin of life or the limits of the universe , but to ask , what do you believe is that you really have to enter a new frontier .
So what is the answer of evolution to the problem of uncertainty ?
Play !
Play is not just a process . Experts in games will say it &apos;s more like a question of being .
Only in games , the uncertainty is celebrated , and the uncertainty is the fun part of the game .
It adapts to change . It opens up opportunities and it &apos;s cooperative . So we &apos;re throwing social contact , and it &apos;s self-motivating , and that means that we &apos;re playing to play . The game is self-rewarding .
If you look at these five lifestyles , it &apos;s exactly the one you need to be a good scientist .
Science is not a section on a sheet of work .
It &apos;s a question of perspective , this one , and that &apos;s true of all creatives .
If you add game rules , you have a game .
This is how an experiment works .
Did it armed with these two ideas that science is a view and experiments , we asked if any scientist could become ?
Who could you ask better than 25 to 10 children ?
These are the experts in the game . I took my beehive and I went to a little school in Decder , and the goal of getting kids to see science with other eyes , but also seeing themselves through science differently .
First of all , they should ask a question .
We didn &apos;t get any money for this study because scientists said that little kids can &apos;t afford a meaningful contribution to science , and the same thing the teachers said .
Of course , we did it anyway .
Here &apos;s just a few of these questions . Small printed so you can &apos;t try to read it . The point is that five of these questions were the basis of any scientific paper in the last five to 15 years .
So they asked the right questions for scientists .
From here , I want to share the stage with somebody special .
She was one of the young people who participated in the study , and now she &apos;s one of the most recent scientists in the world , and when she comes to the stage right now , she &apos;s also the youngest person who has ever spoken at TED .
It takes courage for science and questions .
She &apos;s the personalization of courage because she &apos;s going to talk to you here .
Amy , do you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Amy helps me tell the story of the Blackawton bee project . ( Applause ) It &apos;s going to start with the question that they came to . Sang on , Amy .
Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought it would be easy to see a connection between people and monkeys because we look a little bit like this .
So we asked ourselves if there &apos;s a connection to other animals , but it would be fascinating if people and bees were like this , even though they seem so different from us .
So we asked if people and bees were similar to complex problems .
We wanted to know whether bees were similar to adaptive new situations and used previously harvested rules and conditions , what if bees think like us ?
That would be fascinating . We &apos;re talking about an insect with just a million brain cells .
But in fact , it makes a big sense . Bees recognize , just like us , a good flower , regardless of the daytime , the light , the weather , or the flight angle . ( Applause ) BL : The next step was going to be designed an experiment that was going to be a game , the kids went out and designed the experiment , or the game . Amy , what was that for a game ? What puzzle did the bees have to solve ?
AO : The mystery was a racing Danny rule .
The bees should not only fly to a particular color , but to a certain colored flower with a particular pattern .
They were only rewarded when they flew to the yellow flowers when the yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or when the blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
The bees can learn a few different rules to solve the mystery . The interesting question is , what ?
What was interesting about the project was that neither Beau nor we knew if it was going to work .
It was something completely new . No one had ever done it before , the adults didn &apos;t . ( Laughter ) BL : That was hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to not know what he &apos;s doing , not something else we do in the lab , but a teacher is hard to know the outcome . Thank you very much for Dave Strudwick who helped us do this project .
I don &apos;t invent the study in all the details because you can read it . The next stage was the observation , and here &apos;s some students in the observation , documenting where the bees are flying .
( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what do we do ? Student : 5C .
DS : Is she still up here ? Student : Yes .
DS : So you follow every flight . Student : Henry , can you help me ?
BL : Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist says that ?
Student : There are two up here .
And three here .
BL : We have our observations and our data .
Simple mathematics , guess , etc . , etc .
Now we want to share that . That &apos;s the next step .
We write it up and we want to publish it . We need to write it out .
And of course , we do it in the pub . ( Laughter ) The left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) I told them , this is a piece of writing has four different areas : a guidance , the way , the outcome , the discussion .
The instruction explains the question and why .
The method : What did you do ? The result : What did you observe ?
And the discussion : Who cares about it ?
This is a science paper . ( Laughter ) The children called me words , and I wrote the report , so this piece was written in children &apos;s language .
It was not written by me , but by Amy and their fellow students , and as a result , the paper begins , &quot; &quot; It used to be ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The result was , &quot; &quot; Coach phase , the puzzle ... ta ta taaaahhh . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the way we put the bees in the refrigerator , ( Laughter ) We made beekeeping pie , &quot; &quot; Smiley . That &apos;s the scientific treatise . ( Laughter )
This is the front page . We have a series of authors .
All printed in fat are eight to 10 years old .
The first author is the Blackawton elementary school , and if it &apos;s ever quoted , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Blackawton et , &quot; &quot; and not one alone . We sent it to a public journal , and that was uh-a.a. the answer .
&quot; &quot; The piece of writing writes our quality standards in many ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It starts with , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , the characters are painted with chalk , etc . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we read it against . I sent it to Dale Purves , who is the &quot; &quot; National Academy of Science , &quot; &quot; and a leading neuroscientist in the world is , &quot; which is the most original . ( Laughter )
Larry Maloney , an expert in color watching , says , &quot; The negotiation is great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; If she was written by adults , you could publish them . &quot; &quot; What did we do ? We sent them back to the publisher .
They said no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a résumé for scientists about the outcomes that we found , and we came up with the recommendations of Biology Letters .
There , it &apos;s been reviewed and published by five independent communicators . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) The scientific paper took four months to publish it two years . ( Laughter ) Typically science , what ? So this is what Amy and her friends are doing to the recent scientists in the world .
And what was the feedback ?
It was published two days before Christmas , and 30,000 times a day downloaded !
It was a recommendation in Science , one of the top science magazines .
It &apos;s always free for free for Biology Letters .
It &apos;s the only negotiation that &apos;s ever going to be free in this magazine .
Last year , it was the second-largest underground document in &quot; &quot; Biology Letters , &quot; &quot; and not only did it get by scientists and teachers , but also by the public .
I &apos;m just reading one .
&quot; &quot; I recently read &quot; &quot; Blackawton bees . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m missing words to describe my feelings .
What you &apos;ve done is really , truly and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocence and excitement are the basis and the most important thing in science .
Who , if not kids , has these qualities otherwise ?
Please congratulate your child team of mine . &quot; &quot; I want to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I try with you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah . Okay .
In science , you &apos;re taking risks . That &apos;s a huge risk . ( Laughter ) For me , not for him , because we &apos;ve done it before . ( Laughter ) You like technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Son , but I also like it .
BL : That &apos;s the definition of technology . All right .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration .
Put your eyes and show you where you hear me clapping . Okay ?
( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) You &apos;re all screaming there right now . One , two , three .
Audience : ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Open your eyes . One more time .
You all shout there . ( Screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What is that ? It &apos;s about what science does for us .
We go through life and just act , and if we ever want to do something else , we have to enter the uncertainty , and when he opened his eyes , he could look at the world with new eyes .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers us the opportunity to enter the uncertainty by playing .
Real scientific education should give people a voice and enable them to express that too , so Amy should have the last word in that short story .
So , Amy ?
AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it came to life &apos;s discovery process and showed me that everyone , and I mean everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a big discovery .
To change people &apos;s mind can be easy or hard , and it depends on how this person thinks about change .
My opinion about changing science was amazing . When we started playing and thinking about the mystery , I realized that science is not just a boring subject and that anybody can discover something new .
You just need the opportunity . I came with Beau and the Blackawton Bee Project .
Thank you ! BL : Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmental alist &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s a good choice .
( Laughter ) But what I &apos;m going to talk about , what are the big problems in the world ?
And I have to say , before I go on , I &apos;m going to ask each of you to try and pull out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me take a look at how we do that .
So get your pen and paper out .
There are a lot of problems out there under the ground .
I &apos;m just going to list a few of them .
There are 800 million hungry people .
There are a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are many millions of people who die of HIV and AIDS .
This list can continue forever .
There are two billion people who are going to be seriously influenced by climate change — and so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would all solve them , but we don &apos;t .
In fact , we don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do that , I think the question we have to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why the talk is at the economic arrow — that means , if we don &apos;t do all the things , we really have to start asking ourselves , what should we do first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had 50 billion dollars over the next four years to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We identified the 10 biggest challenges in the world , and I &apos;ll just read them briefly : climate change , transmittable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , migration streams , sanitation and water , subsidies and trade industries .
We believe that in many ways , these are the biggest problems in the world .
So the obvious question would be , what do you think are the biggest things ?
Where should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s the wrong question .
This was actually the question that was asked in Davos in January .
But it &apos;s a problem , of course , when you ask people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
The biggest problem we have in the world is certainly that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have technology to solve this , right ?
So what it comes to is not to prioritize problems , but it comes to prioritize solutions to problems .
And that would be — of course , that gets a little bit more complicated .
Climate change would be similar to Kyoto .
For communicable diseases , that could be classes or bed nets .
For conflicts , it would be the U.N. peacekeepers and so on .
The thing I &apos;m going to ask you to try now is in just 30 seconds — and I know , in a sense , this is an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
And also — and here , of course , economics becomes technoisy — write down what the things we shouldn &apos;t do first .
What should be on the end of the list ?
Please , take 30 seconds , maybe talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what the top priorities should be , and the closest of the priorities to solutions we have for the world &apos;s biggest problems .
The amazing part in this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to love — I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , I &apos;ve given you a pretty remarkable part of time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go on it , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I also encourage you to be sustainable , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;re also going to have these discussions in the night to think about how we prioritize at all ?
Of course , you have to ask , why on Earth has such a list never been made ?
And one reason is that priorization is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do that .
And of course , every organization would love to stand at the top of a list like this .
But every organization also wouldn &apos;t hate being on the top of the list .
And because there &apos;s a lot more non-number one places on the list than number one , it &apos;s absolutely logical to not want to make a list like this .
We &apos;ve been doing the U.N. for about 60 years , but we &apos;ve actually never made a fundamental list of all the big things we can do in the world , and said , what should we do first ?
That doesn &apos;t mean that we wouldn &apos;t prioritize — every decision is a prioritization , so of course we prioritize like if we just implicit — and that &apos;s probably not the same as if we were actually going to prioritize , and go and talk about it .
So what I &apos;m trying to really say is that for a very long time , we &apos;ve had a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the prizes , or the orders of magnitude .
We had no idea .
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting the big menu , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , you take a pizza , but you have no idea what the price is .
It could be a dollar , or it could be a thousand dollars .
It could be a family pizza . It could be a very individual pizza vessel , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that &apos;s what the Copenhagen consensus really tries to do — try and give the problems a price sign .
Essentially , this was the process of Copenhagen consensus .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in every field .
So we had three of the world &apos;s best economists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will it cost ? And what will be the benefit of that ?
Same thing in transmitted diseases .
Three of the world &apos;s best experts who say , what can we do ?
What would the price ?
What should we do about it , and what will the result be ?
And so on .
Then we left some of the world &apos;s best economists , eight of the world &apos;s best economists , including three Nobel laureates , meeting in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
We called it the Traumteam . The prevention of the University of Cambridge decided to call it the Real Madrid of economists .
It works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basically did was create a priorized list .
And then you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy that you &apos;ve asked this question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know about the climate , ask a climatologist .
But if you want to know what you need to deal with first , you can &apos;t ask any of them because it &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing .
That &apos;s what economists do .
They prioritize .
They do it in some ways , in some ways , to say , what should we do first , and what should we do about it ?
So that &apos;s the list , and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see them on the website , and we &apos;ll talk about them over the course of the day , I &apos;m sure .
They basically came out with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically projects where you invest an aura , but less than a dollar back .
Then there are plenty of projects , good projects and very good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects that we should start with .
I &apos;m going to go from the back so that we stop with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you might see , the slip of climate change is the slip .
That puts a lot of people in front of your head , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it because it &apos;s really strange .
How did we get there ?
And I &apos;m also going to try to get back because it &apos;s probably one of the things that I disagree with the list they wrote .
The reason they came up with saying Kyoto — or making more than Kyoto — a bad business is easy because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It doesn &apos;t say global warming doesn &apos;t happen .
It doesn &apos;t mean that this is not a big problem .
But it says that what we can do about it is very little , too high cost .
What they &apos;re basically showing us , the average of all macro-economic models , is that Kyoto , if everybody agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars per year .
That &apos;s a remarkable amount of money .
That &apos;s the second or three times of global aid that we &apos;re getting to the third world every year .
But still , it would make very little difference .
All models show that global warming bothers 2100 by about six years .
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets the tide 2100 can wait up to 2106 .
Which isn &apos;t bad , but it &apos;s not very good either .
So the idea here is really to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing little good .
And just to give you a sense of scale , the U.N. actually estimates that for half of the amount , for about 75 billion dollars , we could solve all the major fundamental problems in the world .
We could provide clean drinking water , sanitation , basic health care and education for every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend the double amount of money doing very little good ?
Or half of the viewer to do amazing amounts of good ?
And that &apos;s the real reason why it &apos;s going to be a bad project .
And we don &apos;t want to say that if we had all the money in the world , we didn &apos;t want to do it .
But with that , we say , if we don &apos;t have it , it just doesn &apos;t have the highest priority .
The sufficient projects — notice that I &apos;m not going to comment all of them — but transmittable diseases , extension of basic health care — just because , yes , more basic health care is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very expensive .
So what this tells us is that suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , there were lots of sanitation and water projects .
Again , sanitation and water are extremely important , but they also cost a lot in terms of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the four top priorities that should at least be the first to deal with when we talk about how we manage the problems in the world .
The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
The new diseases of malaria are on a few million infected a year .
It could cost up to a percentage of GDP per year for affected countries .
If we were to invest about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could reduce the disease in half .
We could prevent 500,000 deaths , but perhaps more importantly , we could prevent about a billion people infected every year .
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with the many other problems that they have to deal with , and of course , in the long run , climate change is too .
The third best idea was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we were to achieve free trade and specifically constraint subsidies in the United States and Europe , we could compete the global economy to an amazing number of 2,400 billion dollars a year that half of the world fell in the Third World .
Again , the point is that we could actually get two to three hundred million people out of poverty , extremely quickly , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best way to focus on malnutrition .
Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very low-cost way of dealing with malnutrition , and that is to address the lack of spiral elements .
Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is missing of iron , zinc , Jod and vitamin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could seriously address the problem .
That would be the second best investment we could make .
And the really best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
If we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we can avoid 28 million cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what the project does , and what it &apos;s targeting is that there are two very different ways of dealing with HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment , the other is prevention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of them , or don &apos;t do very well , at least we should ask ourselves what to invest first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
So basically this says that we can do much more if we invest in prevention .
For the amount of money that we spend , we can do the amount of X good in treatment , but 10 times as much good at prevention .
So again , what we &apos;re focusing on is more prevention than treatment , first of all .
What &apos;s happening here is that we think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like you to take a look at your priority list , did you do it right ?
Or did you get close to the results that you showed here ?
Of course , one of the things about climate change is again .
I noticed that many people find it very unlikely that we should do this .
We should also address climate change , because if not for other reasons , it &apos;s just such a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t care about all the problems .
There are lots of problems out there in the world .
And I want to make sure that if we focus on problems , we also do the right thing .
And that &apos;s where we can do a lot of good things instead of doing little .
And I think — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in Traumteams , did it very well .
One of the things that people forget is that in 100 years , so if most of the climate changes we &apos;re talking about , the mosquito will be much , much richer .
Even the most pessimistic scenarios of the U.N.
We estimate that the average residents of a developing country in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
Probably , they &apos;re going to be twice as rich as we are today .
And of course , we &apos;re going to be even richer than that .
The point is , when we talk about the cage of people , or help people in Bangladesh of the year 2100 , we don &apos;t talk about a poor Bangladesh .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch .
And the real point is , do we want to spend a lot of money in 100 years helping the pretty rich Dutch a little bit ?
Or do we want to help the really poor people in Bangladesh who really need help and who we can help very cheap ?
Or , as Schelling did research , imagine if you were a richer — how you &apos;re going to be — a rich Chinese , a richer Bolivian , a richer Congolese in 2100 , and you think back to 2005 and you say , &quot; &quot; How odd that they were so worried about helping me through climate change a little bit , but rather than taking care of my grandfather , and I think we needed a lot to help with . &quot;
Even if it &apos;s not the typical way we see the problem .
Of course , that &apos;s mostly because climate change has so good images .
Take &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in terms of how I want to see it safe , right , but they don &apos;t expect to caste from Emmerich in his next film Brad Pitt as he &apos;s bubbling in Tanzania latrines or something like that . ( Laughter ) There &apos;s just not that much for a movie .
In many ways , I think about the Copenhagen consensus and the whole debate about priorities as a defense against boring problems .
To make sure that we realize that it &apos;s not about giving us a good feeling .
It &apos;s also not about doing the things that get most of the media attention , but doing the things that we can do most good .
Another objection , as I think , is worth mentioning , is that I — or we — sort of post a false choice .
Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world , I would certainly agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , we decided in the developed world that we would spend twice as much on the developing world as 1970 .
Since then , our aid has halved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the way to solve all the major problems .
Also , people say , but what about the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spent 100 billion dollars on this . Why don &apos;t we spend the money doing good things in the world ?
I &apos;m totally for that .
If any of you can overcome Bush , that &apos;s great .
But the point , of course , is , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we want to spend them in the best way , right ?
So the key point here is that we come back and think about what the right priorities are .
I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list we &apos;ve found ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you end up asking inevitably old white men .
And they don &apos;t necessarily necessarily , you know , the right way to look at the whole world .
So we invited 80 young people from around the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two conditions were that they studied at university , and they speak English .
Most of them were first from developing countries .
They all had the same material , but they could significantly leave the framework of discussion , and they made sure to come up with their own lists .
And the surprising thing is that their lists were very similar — malnutrition and disease at the top and climate change at the end .
We &apos;ve done this many more times .
There were many other seminars and university students and different things .
They all came out with almost the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , to say that I think there is a way to think about the priorities , and what is the really important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again , we &apos;d like to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do that , then we can start thinking about where to start ?
I see the Copenhagen consensus as a process .
We did this in 2004 , and we hope to collect many more people together to get much better information in 2008 and 2012 .
To plan the right way for the world , but also to think about the political choice .
So starting to think about it , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not do things where we can make little too high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know about , but let &apos;s make great things where we can do an enormous contribution of good things , at very low cost and immediately , and at the end of the day , you can resist the discussion about how we actually prioritize , but we have to be honest and say , some things that we do .
If we worry too much about some things , we end up not worrying about other things .
So I hope that this will help us set up better priorities and think about how we work better for the world .
Thank you .
Superheroes are many , many .
But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
For example , the Catadore , people who are collecting recyclable materials .
The Catadore has a heavy , honest and important work that everybody is benefiting , but they don &apos;t get any recognition .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of the trash that &apos;s recycled .
Many of them work independently , collect the garbage on the streets and sell it cheaply to scratch places .
With bags , shopping cart , bicycles and carroças , they &apos;re collecting up to over 300 kilograms of garbage .
Carroças are wood or metal cars that you see almost everywhere in Brazil , almost like graffiti or street art .
So for the first time , I saw this superhero group .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist , and my work is social , ecological and political nature .
In 2007 , I transferred them from the walls on the Carroças to reinforce my message in a new urban way .
Back then , mainly to give the Catadore a voice .
With art and humor , the thing becomes more promising , and that helped the Catadore get attention and enhance their confidence .
They &apos;re now famous on the streets , in the social and mass media .
The thing is that I fell into this universe and never stopped with my work .
I was painting over 200 Carroças in many cities , and I was invited to exhibitions around the world .
And then I realized that the Catadores are not only invisible in Brazil .
I &apos;ve seen them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in industrialized countries like the United States and Japan .
And I realized that I need more supporters , because it &apos;s a big challenge .
Thank you .

Pimp my Carroça is a big crowdfunding project to help the Catadore with their Carroça .
They also get security clothing , gloves , rainjacks and glasses so they can see the city right , while the Carroças are renovated by our volunteers .
They also get security equipment : reflective airlines , copes and mirrors .
Finally , they &apos;re painted by street artists , and they become part of this great , extraordinary visual exhibition .
Pimp my Carroça conquered the streets of São Paulos , Rio de Janeiros and Curitibas .
In order to implement that in other cities outside Brazil , we created Pimpx , inspired by TEDx , ( Laughter ) a simplified do-I-Yourself version of Pimp My Carroça .
That &apos;s how everyone can join .
The Catadores are no longer invisible , but they get more respect and recognition .
They also fight prejudice through academic carroças , their income rises , and they have more contact with society .
Try to see the world without borders or fronts .
Whether you believe it or not , around the world there are over 20 million Catadores .
So if you see one next , you &apos;ll see it as a very important part of our society .
Muito obrigado , thank you .

About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who gave me a TED talk about Virtual Earth , the developer at Bing Maps , the technology of Microsoft .
In the last two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working hard to redefine the way maps work online .
Because what we understand is a very different category than the typical maps of directions that we &apos;re otherwise used to .
The first thing that you might notice here is how liquid you can zoom in with this , which is from Seadragon , if you know this .
Mapping , so the image on a map , of course , is not just cartography , but it has to do with visual representation .
If we go beyond a particular level in zoom , that leads to a kind of sim-city-like virtual representation in the 45-degree angle .
You can look at the image from every sky facility , and you can see the city with all the facade in 3D structure .
We see this three-dimensional space as a canvas that we can transmit all sorts of applications , and road description is really just one of many .
If I click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the applications that we &apos;ve done in the last few months since we went to the launch .
For example , we had a Haiti earthquake earthquake a few days after the disaster , which showed forecast images from the air .
This beautiful application that I can &apos;t show you here , unfortunately , from time standards , is reaching in real time at Hyperlog blogs and educating their stories and entries to the places in the map that are in the blogs .
Simple wonderful .
Instead , I &apos;m going to show you some real geckers now .
As we see , of course , the chart doesn &apos;t stop in the sky .
These little green dots are photosynthesis images of users .
Now , I &apos;m not going to show them any closer , but these pictures are integrated into the map .
All that &apos;s embedded in blue is an area that we also have images from the ground .
So if you fly down there — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , you see this Panorameld , and first of all , it probably ends up not just a picture , but that this environment is equally dimensional as the three-dimensional city from the top , so when I click on something to see it closer , this transition looks like this . This is a function of this geometry , the 3D model behind the 3D model .
I &apos;m going to show you a funny application that we &apos;re working on with our friends at Flickr .
She takes a localized picture of Flickr , and she connects it , in a processing that looks like photosynth , with our graphics — I don &apos;t know if I wanted to have that picture , but — ( Laughter ) — this is a popular place for tourists , of which there are many photos made all at different times .
This is about five o &apos;clock .
This is the Flickr photograph , and this is our chart .
You can see these images coming out of the world of users into the map .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
This is interesting for various reasons , for example , for travel .
Now I can &apos;t show you any of the wacky historical images , because there are also some horses and cousins and so on .
The cool thing about this is that it &apos;s not just about expanding the visual representation of the world with what the users are contributing to it , but also the basis of augmentary reality that I &apos;m going to show you in a moment more .
I went inside now . It &apos;s interesting .
You can see that now there &apos;s a roof above us .
We &apos;re in the Pike Place Market .
This is what we do with a backpacking camera , so we &apos;re not just photographing on the street with these cameras on car rooftops , but we &apos;re also making images of interior spaces .
And we can make the same connections here , not just from standards , but also from videos .
Now , let &apos;s try this out for the first time , live , and before that , I really have a very nice chamber .
( Laughter ) Okay .
( Phone ringing ) Okay , boys , are you there ?
( Honk ) Okay . I &apos;m going to go on it . I &apos;m going to press for repetition .
I &apos;m live . Okay . Here we go .
These are our friends at the Pike Place Market , the lab .
( Applause ) You &apos;re sending this live now .
Okay , George , can you turn back to the market in the corner ?
Because I want to show you some eyesight issues .
No , no . Other way .
Yes , yes , back to the corner . Back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you yet .
Okay . Okay . Back to the corner . Back to the corner . Back to the corner .
Okay , no matter .
So I really wanted to show you these sights up here in the picture , because that &apos;s where you feel like you &apos;re actually there — you could look at this as a step further than augmented-reality .
What the hell are you doing — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to do two different — Okay , I &apos;m going to put up now .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
First of all , we take real ...
( Laughter ) Okay , let me use the opportunity and thank the team .
They &apos;ve managed to do this quite fantastic .
( Applause ) I &apos;m leaving them now and I &apos;m going to go out again .
And as I go out , I &apos;ll just tell you a little bit that we &apos;re using this now for the telepresence , but you &apos;re using this in the field for augmentary reality .
When you use it in the field , that means that you can get all these many metadata and information about the world .
So we &apos;re going to take a next step here by transmitting it live .
This was sent from the market on a 4G network , by the way .
Now there &apos;s a TED Talk that has been giving Microsoft in the last few years .
This was Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
We &apos;re going to go over to the trash containers where typically after a long day on the market , you &apos;re going to pause , or just looking in the sky .
Here &apos;s the WorldWide Telescope integrated into our maps .
( Applause ) This is the current — thank you very much . This is the current time , but if we delete them , we can see what the sky will look like in different ups , and we get very detailed information about different periods of time . Let &apos;s turn the moon a little bit higher , and maybe change the date .
I &apos;d like to zoom in on the Moon .
This is an astronomical picture of the sky that was integrated directly into the picture of the Earth .
Okay , my time went off , I have to finish .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Today I &apos;m going to tell you two things : First of all , what we lost , and second , how we regain it .
Let me start with that .
For me , the thing begins here : this is the mid-ocean coast , without fish , naked rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
This is what I saw when I first jumped into the water on Spaniens Mediterranean Coast .
Now , if an alien came to the Earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe jumps into a coral reef , the alien could see a lot of things .
It &apos;s very unlikely that Joe would end up in an untouched coral reef , a young reef full of corals , sharks , crocodiles , seal molecules , chackenbacks , turtles , etc .
So what Joe would probably see would be in this , in the green part of the picture .
Here we see the extreme with dead corals , a soup of microorganisms , and jellyfish .
And where the diver is , there &apos;s probably most of the reefs in the world right now , with very few algae overgrown coral , lots of bacteria , and there &apos;s the big animals disappeared .
And that &apos;s what most ocean scientists have seen as well .
They go from this situation . That &apos;s what they think , of course , because we started modern science with tools for a long time after degrading marine ecosystems .
So I put all of us in a time machine , and we go to the left , back to the past to see what the ocean was .
Let &apos;s start with this time machine on the Line Islands , where we did a series of expeditions for National Geographic .
This area is a archipeld that belongs to Kiribati and stretches across the equator , and there are several uninhabited , uncontacted islands and some inhabited islands .
So here &apos;s the first : Christmas island , over 5,000 residents .
Most reefs are dead . Most of the corals are dead , flooded by algae , and most fish are smaller than the crayons we use to count them .
We went there in 2005 for 250 hours . We did .
Not a single shark .
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 , and he was reporting about a huge amount of sharks snapping after the rest of their little boats while they went to land .
Let &apos;s move the regulator a little bit further into the past .
Fanning Island , 2,500 residents .
The coral here is better . Many small fish .
Many divers would think of this as paradise .
Here you can see the largest part of the ocean protected area of Florida Keys .
And many people find that it &apos;s very , very beautiful if you don &apos;t know anything else .
If we go back to a place like the Palmyra-Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the coral is doing better , and there &apos;s sharks .
You can see sharks in every dive .
And this is very unusual in the coral reefs today .
But when we reverse the regulator by 200 , 500 years , we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and beautiful , spectacular structures and where the predators are first falling into the eye , where you can see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
What have we learned from these places ?
We originally thought the biomass pyramid was natural .
&#91; graphics &#93; : upper predators , carnivores , plant eaters , plankton .
If we took all the fish and coral reefs together and weigh , we would expect that .
Most of the biomass is down in the food chain : the plant eaters , the dayfish , the puffs that eat the algae .
Then the plankton eaters , these little riffbars , the little ones floating in the water .
And then we have the lower biomass of carnivores , and an even smaller biomass of the top predators , which is the sharks , the big snapper , the zodiac bushes .
But that &apos;s an implication .
This worldview is a consequence of the study of degraded reefs .
When we looked for untouched reefs , we realized that the natural world was on its head , and this pyramid was turned around .
The top now counts for most of the biomass , in some place that &apos;s up to 85 percent like the Kingmanriff , which is now protected .
The good thing about this is that there are not just more breadwinners there , but more of everything .
The scale of these boxes is bigger .
We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , and also more biomass of plants eating , like the dayfish that are like goats in the ocean .
They pollinate the reefs ; everything that &apos;s big enough to be recognized , they eat it , and they keep the reef clean and allow the coral to regenerate .
In all these places — in these old , untouched places — there &apos;s not only a lot of fish , but there &apos;s another important component of the ecosystem , like the giant smuggling ; the lava bags are tied up with giant smugglers , up to 20 to 25 per square meter .
These are disappeared from every single reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water free of microbes and pathogens .
But there &apos;s global warming .
If there &apos;s no fisheries on a reef , because it &apos;s legal protected , or defeated , that &apos;s great .
But the water is going to get warmer for too long , and the coral is going to die .
So how can these fish help these predators ?
Well , we &apos;ve seen one in these areas during El Nino , which is &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , one that has seen that the water has been too warm for too long , lots of corals exited and many died .
In the Christmas Islands , where the food web is very reduced , and the large animals have disappeared , the coral has not yet recovered .
On Fanning Island , the corals haven &apos;t recovered yet .
But here you see a big table coral that died and collapsed .
And the fish grazed the algae so that the algae cover is a little bit lower .
Then we go to the Palmyra-Atoll , which has more biomass of plant predators , and here are the dead corals clean , and the coral comes back .
And if you go to the original site , is it ever expanded ?
These places are also exhausted , but they regenerate faster .
The more intact , the more complete , and the more intricate the food web , the higher the resilience , and the more the system repeats again from the short-term effects of warmth .
And that &apos;s good , so we need to rebuild that construction .
We need to make sure that all parts of the ecosystem are there so that the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
So if we have to rebuild the output situation , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do that ?
Well , there are different ways .
A very obvious one is the marine protected area , especially the protected area with fishing offices that we set up to make life recovery in the ocean .
And let me go back to the picture of the Mediterranean .
This was my starting situation . This is what I saw as a child .
And at the same time , I looked at Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on television with this whole wealth , all the fillings and diversity .
And I thought that this wealth was only in tropical regions , and that the Mediterranean was just a sea without a lot of creatures .
But I had no idea until I first went to a marine protected area .
And there I saw this : a lot of fish .
After a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , they eat the sea urchins , and then the algae grow again .
Then there &apos;s a little algae forest , and you can reach on the size of a laptop more than 100 species of algae , most microscopic little , hundreds of little animals that offer the fish food , so the system recovers .
And this place , the marine protected area of the Medesi Islands , is only 94 acres tall , and is bringing in the local economy six million euros , 20 times more than fishing , it &apos;s for 88 percent of the total tourism revenues .
So these places are not just helping the ecosystem , but also the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
I want to just briefly explain what reservations can do with fisheries management .
This is what happens when we protect these places , and then compare to unprotected places near .
The number of species increase by 21 percent , so if there are 1,000 species , you expect 200 more in a marine protected area .
It &apos;s very considerable .
The size of organisms takes about a third , so the fish are so big now .
The amount of fish there are per square meter increases by almost 170 percent .
And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — the biomass is four and a half times bigger , on average , after only five to seven years .
In some places , there are more than 10 times larger biomass within the protected area .
So we all have these creatures that live in the reserves , and what do they do ?
They grow . This is the basic population biology .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they &apos;ll die later , so they can continue to grow and reproduce much .
And the invertebrate is the same . Here &apos;s the example .
These are epivores that put a snail off the coast of Chile , and so many eggs put it on the sea floor .
Within the reserve , you can &apos;t even see this .
1.3 million eggs per square meter inside the reserve , where there are many of these snails .
So these organisms multiply , there are young larvae in abundance , there are all abundance , and then you can also pull out some benefits from it .
This is on the Bahamas : The Nassau-Zackenbark .
There &apos;s a fill of tackle bars within the reserve , and the more you approach the reserve , the more fish there are .
So fishermen start more .
You can see the boundary of the protected area , because that &apos;s where the boats are all tied together .
So there &apos;s a surplus , there &apos;s revenues outside the limits of this reserve that help people close , while at the same time protecting the whole habitat , it gains stability .
So what we have now — or a world without reservation — is kind of like a giroconto that we &apos;re always taking money from , but never voting anything .
Reserve rates are like savings concerts .
We have this basic facility that we don &apos;t touch , which also produces yields , social , economic and ecological .
And the rise of biomass within the reserve is something like the inflescent .
Two more examples of how these protected areas can use people .
That &apos;s how much fisherman achieves every day in Kenya , when they &apos;re fishing in a place that &apos;s unprotected , the fisheries are all released .
After the most destructive nets , ringwades , were pulled out of traffic , fishermen began to catch more .
So if you eat less , you start more .
If there &apos;s also a reserve with fishing officers , fishermen deserve even more money by fishing around a protected area .
Another example : Nassau-Zackenbark in Belize in the mesoAmerican reef .
This is Zackenbar-sex , and the Zackenbars accumulate for a week around the full moon in December and January .
In the old days , tens of thousands of them gathered , there were 30,000 acryms in this size on a hectare , in a accumulation .
Fishermen knew this , and they started doing it , and they decorated the population .
When I was there in 2000 , there were only 3,000 hackenbars left .
And fishermen were allowed to fish 30 percent of the loaded population every year .
So we did a simple analysis , and you don &apos;t have to be a genius to figure out that if you take 30 percent per year fishing , fisheries will collapse very soon .
And at the same time , the whole reproductive ability of the species collapses as well .
This has happened in so many places in the Caribbean .
And for that , they earned 4,000 dollars a year , so for the entire fishing , with multiple fishing boats .
Now , if you analyze the situation economically and look at what would happen if the fish aren &apos;t caught , and if you take 20 divers in one month , the profits are 20 times higher , and that &apos;s sustainable in the long run .
So how much of it is ?
If it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
And you &apos;ve heard that less than one percent of the ocean is protected .
We &apos;re moving closer to one percent now , thanks to the Chagosi Archipelago , and only in a fraction of it there is total fishing distribution .
Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
The estimated area is between 20 and 50 percent of a set of goals for biodiversity , improvement in fishing and stability .
So how is this possible ? People would say , how much does it cost ?
So let &apos;s think about how much we &apos;re paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars a year .
Many of these subsidies support destructive fishing species .
Well , there are a few estimates about how much the building of a network would cost protected areas that span 20 percent of the ocean , it would be a fraction of what we pay now , and what the government would pay for a collapsing fisheries .
People lose their jobs because fishing collapses .
The creation of a reserve network would give more than a million people direct jobs , not forget about all the seekly jobs and benefits .
So we can do that ?
If it &apos;s so obvious that these savings concerts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t they exist in 20 to 50 percent of the ocean ?
And how can we achieve that goal ?
Well , there are two ways to get there .
The trivial solution is to create vast areas of protected area like the Chagosi archipelago .
The problem is that we can only build these huge reservations in unpopulated areas without social conflicts where the political costs are low , and the economic costs are also low .
And some of us , some organizations in this room and elsewhere , are working on it .
But what about the rest of the world , where are people living from the fishing ?
There are three main reasons why there are not tens of thousands of little reservations : First of all , many have no idea of the function of a marine protected area and fishermen go very easily into the defense if it comes to regulation or permission of one of those small areas .
Secondly , there &apos;s a problem with government form , because most coastal areas in the world don &apos;t have the capacity to control the resources to start and promote the reserve .
The hierarchical structure is designed downwards — people are waiting for the government to come , it &apos;s not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
And that brings us to the third reason why we don &apos;t have any more protected areas , which is that medieval funding has gone wrong .
NGOs and governments normally spend a lot of time , money and resources on a few small areas .
So the protection of the coasts and the ocean has become a Senate for money from governments and philanthropic institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
So the solutions are all targeted on these three issues .
First , we need a global sensitivity campaign to inspire local communities and governments to build fisher-liberated protected areas that are better than what we have now .
It &apos;s the savings account against the Girokonto without guesswork .
And also , we need to rethink the role of government so that the protection measures can be decentralized so that protection measures are not dependent on the work of NGOs , or of ministries , and can be created by the communities , as it is in the Philippines and in some other places .
And third , this is very important , we need to develop new business models .
The link to charity as the only way to create reservations is not sustainable .
We need to develop real models , business models , where food protection is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves bring social , ecological and economic benefits .
And I want to close with one thought , which is that no single organization is going to save the ocean alone .
There &apos;s been a lot of competition in the past , and we have to develop a new partnership model , in real collaboration , where we add each other and we don &apos;t replace each other .
The deployment is just too high to continue as usual .
So let &apos;s go . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Andersen : Thank you , Enric .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
CA : You &apos;ve put things really mastery in context .
First of all , the pyramid , the reverse pyramid , which shows 85 percent of the biomass in the predators , it seems impossible .
How can 85 percent of 15 percent survive ?
ES : Well , imagine two cogs of a clock , a big and a small one .
The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is very fast .
That &apos;s actually it .
The animals at the bottom of the food chain reproduce and grow very quickly , produce millions of eggs .
There are sharks up there , big fish that live 25 to 30 years .
They &apos;re growing very slowly , their metabolism is slow , and they &apos;re basically just preserving their biomass .
The production outbreak of these little guys down there is sort of enough to preserve these talks of biomass .
They &apos;re like condoms in the system .
CA : Very fascinating .
So our image of the food pyramid is basically — we have to completely reverse it .
ES : At least in the ocean .
In the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , where five lions come to a gray .
And on the land , it doesn &apos;t work .
But at least in coral reefs , there are systems that have a basic component with structure .
We suspect that &apos;s everywhere .
But we &apos;ve only been studying original reefs recently .
CA : The numbers you showed are really amazing .
So we spend 35 billion dollars on subsidies .
It would only cost 16 billion to convert 20 percent of the world &apos;s ocean seas into marine protected areas that can even provide new livelihoods .
If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for minus 19 billion dollars .
We could then spend 19 billion on health insurance or something .
ES : And then there &apos;s the weak yields of fishing , which is 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the biggest solutions is that shifts the World Trade Organization to sustainable technologies .
CA : Aha , so there are lots of examples that you hear to stop this subsidize .
So thank you for those numbers .
The last one is a personal question .
The experience of people here who have been living with the sea for a long time was certainly from seeing the decline ; they saw beautiful places that were degrading and basically going .
Tell me about the feeling that you had when you went to these original places and you say things came back .
ES : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We go there to understand the ecosystems , and try to count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the known places .
But the best feeling is the biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about when people have this sense of awe and wonder in terms of an immensely raw nature .
And there , and only there , you can really feel like you &apos;re part of a bigger thing , or a larger ecosystem .
And if there weren &apos;t those hopeful places , I probably couldn &apos;t continue this job .
It would be just too depressing .
CA : Okay , Enric , thank you for joining us some of your spiritual experience . Thank you .
ES : I thank you .
So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m at university and a friend and I start a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island , to Portland , Oregon .
And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we &apos;re driving all the way across the street through conservation areas and national parks — essentially the longest possible route you can take .
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my girlfriend and ask her a question that has been busy for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What should the Chinese characters mean that I see on the roadside all the time ? &quot;
My friend looks completely misunderstood .
And by the way , there &apos;s a gentleman in the first row who &apos;s perfectly imitating their facial expressions .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs that we see all the time with the Chinese sign on it . &quot; &quot; She just stops me for a couple of seconds , and then it breaks out of it because she figured out what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I meant is this .
( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for Rastspot . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations , just like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when it happens and what all of that can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as Chris said , I spent the five years thinking about the wrong thing .
This may seem strange to you as a career election , but it actually has a big advantage : no competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do all kinds of things to avoid , to think about the wrong , or at least to avoid , to think about the possibility that we are wrong with ourselves .
We understand that at an abstract level .
We all know that everyone in this room makes mistakes .
The human species is essentially missing — so far , so good .
But when it comes to me specifically about everything I believe in here in the present , all of a sudden , all of this abstract appreciation of malleability for the cat — and I just don &apos;t think of anything that I could be wrong with .
And the thing is , we live in the present .
We go to meetings in the present ; we make family vacations in the present ; we go to vote and we give our voice back in the present .
All in all , it &apos;s so that we go through life , trapped in this little bubble of certainty , to be absolutely right .
I think that &apos;s a problem .
I think this is a problem for each of us as an individual in our private and our professional lives , and I think this is a collective problem for all of us as a culture .
So what I want to do today is first talk about why we are trapped in the feeling of being right .
And second , why this is such a problem .
And finally , I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to leave that feeling behind you , and that if you can , that &apos;s the greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can do .
So why are we trapped in the feeling of being right ?
One reason actually has something to do with the feeling of wrong .
Now , let me ask you something — or let me ask you the question , because you &apos;re sitting right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
Furrently . Dumb down .
Incredible . Okay , wonderful , good .
Really , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
They answer the question : What does it feel like to discover that you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) Understand that you &apos;re wrong , you can feel exactly the same way and very different , right ?
I mean , it can be exhilarating , it can be revealing , it can actually be very funny , like my stupid misrepresentation with the Chinese characters .
But just being wrong feels nothing at all .
Let me show you an analogy .
Remember the cartoon &quot; &quot; Loony Tunes , &quot; &quot; with this pity of coyote who always chasks the Renncuckuck and never catches it ?
In almost every consequence of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the cojote chasing the Renncuckuck and the Renncuckuck runs over a cliff , which is okay , because he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
But the thing is , the coyote runs right after him through the cliff .
And what &apos;s funny about it — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that it &apos;s perfectly okay for the coyote .
He just goes on — right up to the moment he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s floating in the air .
That &apos;s the moment it falls .
If we &apos;re wrong with something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like the coyote after it &apos;s burned over the cliff and before it looks down .
You know , we &apos;re wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we think we &apos;re on the ground .
So I should correct something I just said .
It feels like something when we &apos;re wrong ; it feels like we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) So this is a reason , a structural reason , why we are in the sense of being right .
I call this false blindness .
Most of the time we don &apos;t have an internal fingertist that tells us that we &apos;re wrong with one thing until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re trapped in that feeling — and that &apos;s cultural .
Think back to primary school for a moment .
You &apos;re sitting there in the class , and your teacher is giving subjects back , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in elementary school , and you know exactly what to think of the child who gets this bow .
This is the dumb kid who makes trouble , one that never does his homework .
And if you &apos;re nine years old , first of all , you &apos;ve learned that people who do things wrong are lazy , irresponsible dumbs — and secondly , in life , if you don &apos;t make mistakes .
We learn this really bad lesson really well .
And many of us — and I suspect , especially many of us in this room — react to that by just becoming little perfect undergraduate students , perfection artists , overeiver .
Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners ?
( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFOs , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners .
That &apos;s okay .
Except that we then escape the possibility of having ourselves wrong with something .
Because according to this , if you do something wrong , something is wrong with us .
So we insisted that we &apos;re right because it gives us the feeling of smart and accountable and talented and being on the safe side .
I want to tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , a woman came to the Beth Israel Deaconess-Hospital .
Beth Israel is in Boston .
It &apos;s the university clinic at Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So the woman comes in and is brought to the surgery .
She becomes narcotized , and the surgeon does his thing — sew it back , send it to the wake room .
Everything seems fine to be done .
And she &apos;s waking up , and she &apos;s looking down , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body connected ? &quot; &quot; Well , the wrong side of her body is connected because the surgeon has done a huge operation on her left rather than done on her right leg .
When the Vice director was talking about the quality of health care in Beth Israel about this incident , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; Whatever , the surgeon just thought to be on the right side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point here is that too much trust in the feeling that being on the right side of something can be very dangerous .
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable reference for what &apos;s actually happening in the external world .
And if we pretend that it would be and stop looking at the possibility that we could be wrong , well , it ends up doing things like reducing 200 million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or colonizing the global economy .
So this is a big practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a big social problem .
Think for a moment about how it is to feel right .
It means that you think your beliefs simply reflect the reality perfectly .
And if you feel like that , you &apos;re faced with a big problem that would be : How can you explain to all the people who are not your opinion ?
It &apos;s like most of us are explaining these people in the same way by reaching back into a series of unfortunate assumptions .
The first thing we do , if you don &apos;t agree , is to assume that those are ignorant .
They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and if we generalize that information with them , they will look at the light at the end of the tunnel and change on our site .
If that doesn &apos;t work , if it turns out that people have the same facts as us , and they still don &apos;t agree with us , then we go to a second assumption that says they &apos;re idiots .
( Laughter ) They have all the appropriate puzzle pieces , and they &apos;re mentally not able to put them together correctly .
And if that doesn &apos;t work , if it turns out that people who don &apos;t agree with us have the same facts that we and are quite smart , then we go to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are distorting them in intention for their own malignant intentions .
This is a disaster .
This fidelity to our own right keeps us from avoiding mistakes when it &apos;s really necessary and makes us treat each other horribly .
But what &apos;s most amazing and tragedy to me is that it &apos;s not going to be the core of human being .
It &apos;s as if we want to imagine that our mind is an absolutely transparent window and we just look out and describe the world as it unfolds in front of us .
And we want everybody else to look through that same window and see exactly the same thing .
But it &apos;s not that , and if it were , then life would be incredibly boring .
The miracle of your mind is not that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it is not .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be another person in a different place .
And we all do this a little bit differently , and so we can all look in the same night sky and see this , and also this one .
And yes , that &apos;s also why we understand things wrong .
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about , &quot; &quot; I think so I am , &quot; &quot; this man named St. Augustinus sat down and wrote , &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I &apos;m wrong , so I am . &quot;
Augustinus understood that our ability to deny things is not a kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something that we can eradicate or overcome .
It &apos;s an absolutely fundamental part of our self .
Because unlike God , we don &apos;t really have a clue of what &apos;s going on here .
And unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure it out .
For me , this obsession is the source and root of all our productivity and creativity .
For various reasons last year , I heard a lot of public radio show &quot; &quot; This American Life . &quot;
And so I hear and hear , and at one point I feel like somehow all the stories are about being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s it .
I became the crazy Irtums-Lady .
I just see it all over the place , which has happened .
But a few months later , I had the opportunity to interview Ira Glass , the moderator of the program .
And I mentioned this to him , and he said , &quot; &quot; No , that &apos;s really true .
In fact , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Tell the team that every single sequence of our program has the same secret issue .
And the secret issue is , &apos; I thought this one thing would happen , and then something else happened instead . &quot; &quot; And the fact is , &quot; &quot; Ira Glass says , &quot; &quot; We need that .
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and error to tell these stories . &quot; &quot; And by the way , those of us , as audience , as readers , we suck up this stuff .
We love things like twisted actions and false currencies and a surprising end .
When it comes to our stories , we love to be wrong .
But , you know , our stories are because our lives are like this .
We think that one thing will happen and something else will happen instead of it .
George Bush thought he would invent Iraq , find a bunch of mass destruction weapons that free people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened instead of that .
And Hosni Mubarak thought he would be a dictator for the rest of his life in Egypt until he was too old or too sick and he could pass his rule to his son .
And something else happened instead of that .
And you might have thought that you would grow up and marry your first love from school and go back to your hometown and raise a few children together .
And something else happened instead of that .
And I have to tell you that I thought I would write this incredibly nerdy book about a theme that everybody hated for an audience that would never be there .
And something else happened instead of that .
( Laughter ) I mean , that &apos;s how life is .
In the good as in the bad , we produce these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and surprised us .
Nothing for fun , but this whole conference is an incredible memorial of our ability to make things wrong .
We &apos;ve just spent a whole week talking about invention and progress and improvement , but you know why we need all these inventions and progress and improvements ?
Because half of what &apos;s most amazing and revolutionary — TED 1998 — isn &apos;t it ?
( Laughter ) Did somehow not work , right ? ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So now we &apos;re back here .
And that &apos;s how the nose goes .
We &apos;re developing a different idea .
We tell a different story .
We &apos;re going to have another conference .
The theme of this , as you &apos;ve all heard about seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
And to me , that means , if you really want to rediscover the wonder , you have to move out of your little , in fear of righteous space of rightness and look at each other and look out into the wisdom and complexity and into the mysteries of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I have no idea .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On November 5 , 1990 , a man named El-Sayid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and practiced a deadly attribute on Rabbi Meir Kahane , the founder of Jewish Defense League .
Nosair was finally convicted of his condemning .
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
I looked at these men .
These guys , I called &quot; &quot; ammu , &quot; &quot; which means as much as uncle .
So what opened my eyes ?
Another important turning point came when I got a job in the summer in the bush Gardens , a forecast park .
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
It &apos;s very simple .
Instead , I use my experiences to fight against terrorism , to fight the fanatism .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m delighted to be here .
I &apos;m taught about invitation , thank you .
I &apos;d love to talk about things that interest me , but unfortunately I suspect what I &apos;m interested in is not a lot of other people interested in .
First of all , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
I &apos;d love to talk about astronomy , but I think the number of people who are interested in radiation outcomes in non-gray atmospheres and light polarization in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter is the number of people who fit into a warehouse .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
( Laughter ) It would be as much fun to talk about some of the things that happened in 1986 and 1987 when a computer hacker has penetrated into our system over here in Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
And I caught the guys , and it turned out they worked for what was the Soviet KGB and stolen and sold information .
And I &apos;d love to talk about it — and it would be fun — but 20 years later ...
I find computer security , frankly , quite boring .
It &apos;s exhausting .
I &apos;m — if you do something for the first time , it &apos;s science .
The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
The third time , you &apos;re just a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . After doing something else , I do something different .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
I &apos;m also not going to talk about things that I think are obvious statements from my first book , Silicon Snake Oil , or my second book , I &apos;m going to talk about why I don &apos;t think computers are in schools .
I feel like a huge and bizarre idea is that we need to bring more computers into schools .
My thought is , no ! No !
Take them out of the schools and drop them out of the schools .
And I &apos;d love to talk about it , but I think the argument is for anyone who has already been close to a 4.th grade , so obvious that you don &apos;t have to say a lot about it — but I think I might be very wrong here , and everything else I said .
So don &apos;t go back and read my interpretation .
There &apos;s probably the same lying in there .
After I said that — I broke my talk five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And if you look at it here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
I want to talk about the future , right ?
OK . And I feel like I &apos;m talking about the future is bizarre , because I have gray hair , so it &apos;s pretty absurd for me to talk about the future .
In fact , I think if you really want to know what the future will be like if you really want to know about the future , they don &apos;t ask technologists , scientists , physicists .
No ! Don &apos;t ask anybody writing the code !
No , if you want to know how society is going to be in 20 years , ask a pediatrician .
They know .
Rather , don &apos;t ask any kindergarten nerd , ask a experienced one .
These are the ones who know how society will be in a generation .
I don &apos;t know . Even so , I suspect there are many other people talking about what the future will bring .
Certainly , each of us can imagine these cool new things that will be there .
But for me , things are not the future .
What I &apos;m asking is , how will society be when the kids are so phenomenally good at the news these days and spend a lot of time on the screen , but have never been bowing together .
It &apos;s a change , and what &apos;s changing is not software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it would be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing right now . What am I doing ?
Oh — the other thing I think I &apos;d like to talk about is over here . Right here .
Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about are one-page things .
I &apos;d like to talk about things that only have one side .
Because I love furniture screws . I love furniture screws not just , but I &apos;m actually one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world who make classes .
I hope all of your eyes start to shine .
This is a clay bottle .
For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup . I know everything about it .
It &apos;s one-page . It &apos;s a bottle whose downside is also its outdoor .
It has a volume of zero , and it &apos;s not orientable .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two furniture slices and sew them together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
And I &apos;d love to talk about it , but I don &apos;t have a lot to say about ... things because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;m colored . ) Anyway , the D &quot; &quot; in TED , of course , is for design .
Just two weeks ago , I did — you know , I made little , medium and big classes for the exhibition .
But I just — and I &apos;m pleased to show you here for the first time in the public .
This is a influential bottle , which , although it shouldn &apos;t be able to contain a liquid at all , is perfectly capable of having our universe only three dimensions of space .
And because our universe has only three dimensions of space , it can contain liquid .
It &apos;s highly — this is the cool one .
This was a month of my life .
But even though I &apos;d love to talk to you about topography , I won &apos;t do it .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom who died last summer .
Did photos of me collect how mothers do this ?
Can anybody project this guy ?
And I looked at her album , and she stored a photograph of me standing in 1969 a few regulators — well , I sat .
And I looked at it and said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , that was me working in the electronic music studio !
As a technician , I repaired and maintained the electronic music studio at the State of New York at Buffalo . And wow !
Time machine . And I said , oh yeah !
And she sent me back .
Shortly after that , I found another picture she had , a picture of me .
This guy over there , of course , is me .
This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Mogo synthesizer who died this August .
Robert Moog was a generous , nice person ; an extraordinarily competent engineer .
A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a graduate student at the SUNY Buffalo .
He came out of Trumansburg to teach me things , not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we also sat there — I studied physics at the time . This was 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We studied physics , I studied physics , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing .
Don &apos;t stay in the electric music if you do physics . &quot; &quot; My mentor . He came up and spent an hour with me .
He wrote me a sense of recommendation so that I could do a college student .
My bike in the background .
I know this picture was taken in my friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Moog came along and brought a mountain of equipment to show Greg Flint and show me things with it .
We sat around talking about Fourier transformations , functions , modulation transactions , things like that .
Cows death this summer was a loss for all of us .
Everybody who &apos;s a musician today has been deeply influenced by Robert Moog .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just tell you a little bit about what I &apos;m going to do . What I &apos;m going to do — I hope you can see that there &apos;s a deformed sine curve , a almost triangular wave on this Hewlett-Packard-Oszilloscope .
Oh cool . I can go over here , right ?
Children . Children are what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
Here &apos;s children , I &apos;d like to talk about that .
I decided , at least for me , that I don &apos;t have enough big head .
So I think local and I operate local .
I think I can best help if I help very , very local .
So Dr. here and graduate there , and yadda yadda .
I spoke to some teachers about this stuff about a year ago .
And one of them , some of them came to me and said , &quot; How come you actually don &apos;t teach ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate students — I &apos;ve already been a Ph.D. student lecture , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re interested in kids like this , and everything , how come you &apos;re not on the front lines here ?
Let your words follow action . &quot; &quot; Right . Right . I teach science for four days a week to watch classes .
Not just to show up and show up .
No , no , no , no , no . I &apos;m here .
I &apos;ll take lunch cars . ( Applause ) That &apos;s not — no , no , no , don &apos;t clap .
I recommend with pressures that this would be a good thing for each of you .
It &apos;s not just going to come out of class .
Make a whole week . Okay , I &apos;ve only got a three-quarter , but anyway .
One of the things I did for my students was to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you physics at college level .
I don &apos;t have calculus , I &apos;ll take that out .
You &apos;re not going to have to learn trigonometry .
But you &apos;re going to need eight-grader algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
No &quot; &quot; Open your book in chapter seven and do all the tasks . &quot;
We &apos;re going to do real physics here . &quot; &quot; And I thought that &apos;s one of the things I &apos;m going to do now .
( High-frequency ton ) Oh , before I even switch this on , something we did about three weeks ago in my class — that was through a lens , and one thing we needed was a lens to measure the speed of light .
My students in El Cerrito — of course , with my help , and using a very low-income oscope , measured the speed of light .
We were 25 percent wrong . How many eight graders do you know that the speed of light is measured ?
And in addition , we measured the speed of sound .
I would love to measure the speed of light here .
I was prepared and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man , &quot; &quot; I wanted to implant something here and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m prepared for it . I &apos;m prepared for it , but then it turns out you only have 10 minutes to build this .
And I didn &apos;t have enough time for that .
So maybe next time , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light .
But , in the meantime , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound .
The most obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to let sound reflect somewhere and look at echo .
But probably — one of my students , Ariel , asked , could we measure the speed of light by using the wavelength ?
And every one of you knows the equation : the frequency of each wave &apos;s wavelength ...
It &apos;s a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelengths get smaller . The wavelengths go up , the frequency gets smaller . So if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s the interesting — when the sound gets bigger , everything gets closer together , sound gets smaller , everything &apos;s expanding .
Right ? That &apos;s simple physics .
All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth grade physics — but they should have done it — and I wish they had — is that if you multiply the frequency with the wavelengths of the sound , or the light , you get a constant .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
So to measure the speed of sound , I just have to know the frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
I have a frequency counter here .
You put it in about a three-way A. That &apos;s a A , more or less .
Now I know the frequency .
It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelengths .
All I have to do now is sniffle another beam , and the lower steel I &apos;m talking about , right ?
Every time I speak , look at it on the screen .
I &apos;m going to put it over here , and as I move it away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
Move like a Slinky . We go through different nodes of wave coming out in this direction .
The physicists among you , I hear you spin your eyes , but you have patience with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelengths , I just have to measure the distance from here , a complete wave up here .
From here to here , the wavelengths of sound .
So I &apos;m going to put a tape here , and I &apos;m going to move it back here .
I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
OK , back to Mr. Elmo .
And we say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s calculate what that is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
If you look at it in the book , it &apos;s actually 343 .
But with noisy material and lousy drinks — we managed to measure the speed of sound — not bad . Pretty good .
That all leads to what I wanted to say .
Look at the picture of me a million years ago .
It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was running , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I study physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
I go home over the holidays , and on the campus there were riots .
There were Randale ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done , ready .
There are riots on the campus , and the police are tracking me , OK ?
I walk over the campus . Policeman comes , looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Get a gun . Bom !
And a single-tailer is the size of a carpet can fly past my head . Whoosh !
I get a shame of danger gas , and I can &apos;t breathe .
The policeman is tracking me with a rifle .
He wants to brick me one about the armor !
I say to myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get out of here ! &quot; &quot; I run over the campus as fast as I can . I walk into the Hayes Hall .
This is one of these limestone buildings .
The policeman is tracking me .
Give me the first , second , third floor up .
So follow me in this room .
The entrance to the monastery .
I plug the door behind me , sticker up , come to a place where I see a pendulum swing .
And I think , ah , the square of the length is proportional to the periodic . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll keep sticking up .
I come to a place where a furniture has broken down .
There are pipes , clockwork , clockwork , clockwork .
Time goes backwards because I &apos;m on the inside .
I think of border contractions and Einstein &apos;s relativity .
I &apos;ll kick up , and there &apos;s a place , far back , where you climb up this wooden ladder .
I come up , and there &apos;s a wolf there .
A dome , a three-foot dome .
I look out and see policemen hitting into student heads , moving dancers , looking at students throwing stones .
And I wonder , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? Then I remembered what my English teacher said to me in high school .
And that is that , in the lockepot , the rules are placed .
So I &apos;m going to wipe the dive off one of the bells and look at it .
And I wonder , why am I here ? At this point I &apos;d like to tell you what words are going to put the flavor of Hayes Hall : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
So in this light , science and religion aspire to the continuous evolution of humanity , from the darkness to light , from desperation to generosity , from prejudice to tolerance .
It &apos;s the voice of life that calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
When I stood on the porch and crawled in my pockets , I realized that my keys were missing .
I could see them through the window , they were on the dining table where I left them .
I ran around the house and tried all the other doors and windows that were closed .
I started thinking about calling a sloser , because I had my cell phone , but at midnight it could take until a shooter came , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t cross with my friend Jeff because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning and needed my travel pass and suitcase .
I desperately and I frozen , I found a big stone , and I crushed so that the window of the window , hitched the glass sheets , climbed in , found a piece of cardboard , and pasted it over the hole , with the thought , the morning , on the way to the airport , to call my creator , with the request to fix it .
That would cost a lot , but probably not more than a sloser in the middle of the night , so I thought , under those circumstances , it &apos;s going to come out of the same way .
I &apos;m a healthy neuroscientist , and I know a little bit about how the brain behaves in stress .
It spills Cortisol out , which increases the heart rate , it corresponds to the area of the adrenaline , and it incorporates the mindset .
The next morning , I had slept too little , and I was worried about the hole in the window , and I had to think about calling my developer and the ice temperatures and the standing meetings in Europe with all the Cortisol in my brain , my thinking was rubbed , just didn &apos;t know , because my thoughts were just rubbed .
( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t until I stood on the Check-off switch at the airport that I realized that my bass was missing . ( Laughter )
So I went home in 40 minutes through snow and ice , and I pulled my desk and I went back to the airport , and I just managed to do it , but my place had already been passed , and I ended up landing next to the bathroom at the end of the plane , in a non-negotiable seat , in an eight-hour flight .
I had a lot of time thinking in those eight hours without sleep .
( Laughter ) And I wondered if there are things that I can do , mechanisms that I can do that can prevent the outcome of bad things ?
You all know what the post-morality is .
In the premortal , as Danny explained , you look forward to see what could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what to do so that these things can &apos;t interfere or minimize the damage .
What I want to talk about today is a couple of things that we can do in the form of a pre-morph .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not .
I &apos;m going to start with the obvious ones .
Take a place at home for things that you lose easily .
It sounds very logical , and it &apos;s also , but there &apos;s a lot of science behind it that &apos;s based on how our spatial memory works .
One component of the brain called the hippocampus has evolved over tens of thousands of years to track where important things have been laid down — where the wells are , where you can find fish , the place with the fruit trees , where the uncovered and the refined tribes live .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
And if you ask yourself , somebody did the experiment where the smell of squirrel was turned off and found their nuts anyway .
They didn &apos;t use smell , they used the hippocampus , these very sophisticated mechanisms in the brain to find things .
It &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move much , but not so good for things that move .
That &apos;s why we lose car dishes , reading glasses and rabbits .
Make a place for your keys in your house — a hook next to the door , maybe a beautiful shell .
For your bass , a particular bladder .
For your readers , a particular table .
If you place a certain place and keep yourself in it , your things will always be there if you look for them .
What about travel ?
Make a cell photograph of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your pass , email it to be in the cloud .
These are pretty obvious things .
Don &apos;t forget , stress hits the brain of Cortisol .
Cortisol is toxic and causes unclear thinking .
Part of the pre-morph is to realize that stress is not in its best form and should be preparing mechanisms for it .
There &apos;s probably no more stressful situation than if you &apos;re faced with a medical decision .
I &apos;m going to talk about a particular disease image .
But this will be an example of any medical decision , and even for decision making in the financial and social — any kind of decision making that might benefit from rational delivery of facts .
Suppose you go to the doctor , and he says , &quot; I &apos;ve got your results back from the lab , and your cholesterol is a little bit higher . &quot;
Now you all know that high cholesterol is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
Over the number of treatments necessary .
What is that ?
It &apos;s the number of people who take a drug or have an operation or have to take a procedure before a person is helped .
You think , what is this a crazy statistic ?
The number should be one .
But medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
It &apos;s not the doctor who &apos;s blamed of that , then scientists like me .
GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of all drugs only work at 30 to 50 percent of people .
What do you think is the number of treatments necessary for the most prescribed state ?
How many people have to take it before it &apos;s helped ?
I &apos;ve checked the numbers themselves .
300 people have to take the drug a year before a heart attack , a stroke or something like that is prevented .
Now you probably think , &quot; &quot; Okay , one in 30 chance to lower my cholesterol .
Why not ? Give me the recipe anyway . &quot; &quot; But here you should ask for another statistic , which is , &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot;
For this particular drug , side effects occur at five percent of the patients .
It &apos;s 15 times more likely to hurt you than it helps you .
I &apos;m just saying that you should talk to your doctor about it .
They have the right to this information to decide whether you want to take the risk or not .
And for the most pervasive surgery for men over 50 , exception of prostate cancer , the number of treatments necessary is 49 .
Right , 49 surgeries are necessary before one person has been helped .
And here are the side effects that occur at 50 percent of the patients .
These include impotence , disorders of recovery , harnincontinence , stomach darkness , chair control .
If they &apos;re one of the lucky 50 percent to respond to , they only stop one or two years .
And you should also think of things like quality of life .
Because you often have a choice , do you want a shorter , painful life or a longer life that might be very painful at the end ?
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for that .
Confronted with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if your body uses metabolism , and you don &apos;t respond quickly , you might be eating the lion , and the rest doesn &apos;t matter .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes down the bach during the sphere is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
So we have to train to think about these kinds of situations in advance .
The most important point is to recognize that we &apos;re all flawed .
We &apos;re all going to stop and fail .
It &apos;s about thinking about what mistakes that might be , providing mechanisms that help minimize damage , or prevent the outcome of bad things from preceding .
And I have to admit , I still have a bunch of unauthorized mail and a lot of emails that I haven &apos;t read yet .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
They took my name sign , but I wanted to ask , did anybody write their name in Arabic ?
Anybody ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , not too long ago , I was sitting with a friend in a restaurant doing food .
So I looked at the waiter , and I said , &quot; Do you have a menu ? &quot;
He looked at me as if he had failed .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry . ( English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu , please . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s called ? &quot; &quot; Yes , I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of them ! &quot; &quot; the waiter said .
He was conflicted when he was talking to me , as if he was thinking , &quot; Even if this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at them ! &quot;
What does it mean to say &quot; &quot; menus &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Two words made a Lebanese young man convicted a girl as reverse and ignorant .
How could she speak that way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking about it .
It made me angry .
It definitely hurts !
I &apos;m denied to speak my own language in my country ?
Where else could that happen ?
How did we get so far ?
While we are here , there are many people like me who are reaching a point in their lives where they are reluctant to give up everything that has happened to them in the past just so they can say they &apos;re modern and civilized .
Should I forget my culture , thoughts , my mind and my memories ?
Now , childhood memories may be the best memories of war !
Should I forget everything in Arabic so I &apos;m adapted ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic ?
In spite of that , I tried to understand him .
I didn &apos;t want to give him as hard as he convicted me .
The Arab language doesn &apos;t satisfy the needs of today .
It &apos;s not a language of science or research , not a language that we &apos;re used to at the university , not a language that we use in the workplace , not a language that we &apos;re working with in a modern research project , and certainly not a language that we use at the airport .
If we did , we would blame .
Where can I use it ? We can all ask this question !
You want us to use Arabic . Where can we do that ?
That &apos;s one reality .
But we should think about a different , even more important reality .
Arabic is the mother &apos;s language .
Researchers say that the deception of other languages predicts the mastery of their native language .
Making your own mother &apos;s language is premise .
Khalil Gibran . When he started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , fantasy and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , who had a certain smell in his nose , a certain voice in the ear , a certain thoughts in his head .
When he started writing English , he had enough taste .
Even when he wrote in English . When you read his English scripts , you smell the same smell , you feel the same feeling .
You can imagine that he &apos;s writing in English , the same boy who came out of the mountains from a village in Lebanon .
So this is an example that no one can disagree with .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is the destruction of their language .
This is a reality that is aware of developed societies .
The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese .
They make them sacred .
That &apos;s why they use them in production .
Well , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t yet achieved us , and we &apos;d like to bring the civilized world in .
Countries that once were like us , but decided to move forward , research and bring in the other countries , like Turkey , Malaysia and others , they took their language as they climbed up the ladder , protected them like a diamond .
They kept them close to themselves .
If you get a product from Turkey or from elsewhere , and it &apos;s not on Turkish , it &apos;s not a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They would become consumers again , unemployed consumers , as we are most of the time .
To create and produce innovations .
It doesn &apos;t sound , right ?
Unaware of who , how and why .
Language is not just for communicating .
So if we say &quot; &quot; freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you shapes your own imagination of it in your mind , there are certain feelings of a particular day of a certain historical period .
Language is not one , two or three words combined , or letters .
It &apos;s an idea in it that has a relationship with our way of thinking , about how we look at each other and how others see us .
What is our mind ?
How can you say this guy understands or not ?
When I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your son comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived in the time of the Friday spice ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem in it , I should go better and stop giving my time .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of certain things .
I have a French speaker who married a French speaker .
I once asked them how things are going .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all OK . Just once I spent a whole night trying to translate him the meaning of the word &quot; &quot; toqborni . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman said , &quot; &quot; toqborni &quot; &quot; to him , and then tried all night to explain this to him .
He was confused with the thought , &quot; &quot; How can someone be so gray ?
Do they want to commit suicide ?
&quot; Get me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that she can &apos;t say that to her husband because he wouldn &apos;t understand it , and he &apos;s right ; his way of thinking is different .
Consider that for me .
( Applause ) What did we do to protect the Arab language ?
We made it a civil society issue , and we have a campaign for perception .
Forget this problem and have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign for perceiving the Arab language has the motto : &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t accept this or this . &quot; &quot; So we didn &apos;t accept this style , because then you wouldn &apos;t understand us .
Because when someone talks to me like this , I hate the Arab language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and in a way , be convinced .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you answer from the West &quot; &quot; it gets to the point .
Something very simple and yet creative and conviction .
Then we launched another campaign with a writer on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example out there , a writer , surrounding by black and yellow band , saying , &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot;
Why ? In fact , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill our language , we would have to find an identity .
We need to find an existence .
We would go back to the beginning .
That means far more than just our chance to miss .
We &apos;re very cool !
And for anyone who now says , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You &apos;ve used a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word cool . &quot; &quot; Let them react like they want , but give me a word that &apos;s better and better fit to reality .
I &apos;m going to keep saying &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; ( English ) I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the global network . &quot; &quot; ( Arabic ) ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t hide ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be convinced that we should not allow anybody to be bigger than us or think that in point to language about us , to control us or to feel like they want .
Creativity is the idea .
If we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket , and so we can be creative .
At this moment , each of you is a creative project .
Creativity in your mother &apos;s language is the way .
Let &apos;s start from that moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or make a short movie .
A single novel can make us global again .
It can bring the Arab language back to space one again .
That there &apos;s no solution , right . There &apos;s a solution !
But we need to know this and be convinced by a solution , that we have the obligation to be part of this solution .
And as a conclusion , what can you do today ?
And tweets , who tweets ?
Please , I ask you , even though my time is around , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic .
You would enter a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place .
Secondly , there are many more things we can do .
We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to be aware of the need to be aware of .
A baby identifies his father first by language .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s strike this cultural launch . ( Applause )
Sustainability emits what , where and how fishness is .
The who and the why are central to me .
I want to know the people who are behind my food choices .
I want to know how I influenced them .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they depend on the glasses of the water to make a living .
To understand all this , it allows us to change our perception of ocean density , away from a raw material , to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
This allows us to appreciate the ocean ocean that we &apos;re happy to appreciate , to honor .
And what do we call the whole thing ?
I would say we call it regenerating seafood .
Where sustainability means regret and inconsistent is the ability to arrest and make progress .
The idea of same-sex ocean density is going to calm up a developing and dynamic system , and recognizes our relationship to the ocean as a resource by encouraging us to commit the ocean back and promote its resistance .
It &apos;s a hopeful , more humane , and a more useful way to understand our environment .
Tashing leaders — again and again , a position among many in the world of ocean farming — are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
Green , yellow and red categorize ocean species .
The connection is very simple : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think about yellow twice .
But I think it &apos;s really not enough for you to just keep the green list .
We can &apos;t go through that without really changing the measure of our success , the fate of species in the yellow and the red list .
But if we just eat the green list ?
Here we have the Angel Fissed yellowfin tuna — it comes from sustainable pollinations .
With the angel — no bycatch .
Good for fishermen . Lots of money . Help the local economy .
But it &apos;s a lion of the ocean . It &apos;s a top predator .
What &apos;s the background of that meal ?
Do I end up with a 450th portrait of it in a steel house ?
Do I do that three times a week ?
I still may be in the green list , but I don &apos;t do myself , or you , or the ocean some kind of threats .
The point is that we need a relationship , a measure of our actions all around the world .
For example , I &apos;ve heard that red wine is good for health — antioxidants and minerals — healthy for the heart .
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
And , like many bottles do you tell me I have a problem ?
Now people , we have an protein problem .
We &apos;ve lost that empathy when it comes to our food , and we pay for it a prize .
The problem is that we hide that price under the waves .
We hire that price behind the social acceptance of growing waisters .
And we hire that price behind huge wins .
The first thing is to say , the idea of regenerating seafood is that it actually considers our needs .
Regenerating marine mammals are best represented not by &quot; &quot; The white shark , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Flipper , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; cheese &apos; n Iglo , &quot; &quot; but rather the &quot; &quot; Jolly Green Giant &quot; &quot; — the vegetable .
Cables : they could save the ocean even .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
Well , I have the honor to announce that Broccoli Green could be the new blue .
We need to continue to eat the best seafood if at all .
But we also have to eat a lot of vegetables .
But the best thing about renewable seafood is that they &apos;re preserved in half the shell shell with a bottle of tobacco and cittery pumps .
They &apos;re served as 140g portion Buntbark , pandemic with Dijon-Shelf and crisp , curled bread trees and a torturing mountain of Pekannus &apos;s rice with baked , grilled Broccoli so soft and white and exposed and smoked with a small Prisky Chili .
Ohh !
That sells good .
And the best part is that all these ingredients are available for every family in the next supermarket .
Jamie Oliver is engaged in protecting America from our food habits .
Sylvia enters to protect the ocean from our food habits .
Here &apos;s a pattern of pattern .
Forget the atomic inferno ; it &apos;s the wires we have to worry about .
We &apos;ve devastated our Earth , and the food that we &apos;ve moved from it to compromise ourselves in more than one way .
So I think we have a completely wrong eating behavior .
And I think it &apos;s time to change our demand for food .
Sustainability is complicated , but a food is a fact that we all understand very well .
So let &apos;s start with this .
More recently , there was a lot of movement to make our food systems environmentally friendly .
Dan Barber and Alice Waters passionately lead the Culinary Revolution for ecological food .
But ecological food often gives us a way to discriminate our responsibility as a food .
Just because it comes from an ecological source doesn &apos;t mean that we can treat it on the plate with indifference .
There are oft-friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have the technology to do it .
But we will never have a cook-friendly all-you-can-at Shrimps Buffet .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Mahals that are good for the heart are a very important part of the regenerative seafood .
While we &apos;re trying to handle abundant marine populations , the media recommendations of marine mammals .
Research suggests that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers would be during the next birthday when more seafood and fish were preserved .
That &apos;s a reward I don &apos;t want to leave .
But it &apos;s not just ocean seafood .
It &apos;s the way we look at our plate .
As a chef , I realized that the easiest thing I can do is to shrink the size of the portions on my plate .
And then some things happened .
I made more money .
People started to eat and salt because they knew that the main court was not going to feed them .
They took more time to deal with their meals to deal with each other with their meals .
In short , people got more when they expected less protein .
They took more calories in the course of a diverse meal .
They got healthier . I made more revenue .
That &apos;s great .
With each plate , ecological review was preserved , but at the same time , a growing mountain of consideration of human efforts .
Another thing that we did was extend the species that we served — little syllables , Sardells , makeues , Sardins were female .
Smaller , shells , oysters , Venusmugles , buntbarsch , Saibling — they were the known species .
We put the bats towards more resilient , repetitive opportunities .
We should be afraid of that .
That &apos;s exactly what the Green List says .
But in the same way , we can actually start to restore our environment .
But what about the big predators , the fashion principles , the tuna on the green list I talked about earlier ?
Now , if you have to , I have a recipe for you .
It works with almost every big fish in the ocean , here it comes .
Let &apos;s start with a 450 portion of a big fish .
Take a knife . Put it in four pieces .
Put it on four plate .
If you look at these four plate vegetables , and then open the very best bottle of Burgunder you have , claim candles and celebrate it .
Enjoy the chance to eat that .
Make your friends and neighbors and repeat the whole thing once a year , maybe .
I expect a lot of food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I expect that the production of ingredients , the preparation of courts and the food of the meals , that all of that is part of human interests .
I was fortunate that my father was a fantastic chef .
And he taught me very early that food is a privilege .
I remember the meals of my childhood very well .
It was sensible portions of protein served with rich quantities of vegetables and small quantities of strength , usually rice .
That &apos;s the way I &apos;m still eating today .
I &apos;m going to be bad when I go to steakhhouses .
I get sweatshots of meat .
It &apos;s like a crater of protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But from all the horrible news that you &apos;re going to hear about the state of our ocean , and that you &apos;ve already heard , I have the unfortunate burden to give you probably the worst of all , and that is that all the time she was right about her mother .
Isn your vegetable .
It &apos;s pretty direct .
So what do we expect from a meal ?
Well , health , I expect conventional ingredients that are good for my body .
Joy , I want butter and salt and sexy things that make ingredients taste less .
My family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that go into the knees before my lifetime .
But with society , however , we &apos;re beginning .
There is no emergence in the fact that everything we eat has global impacts .
So try your best to know what those implications are , and then take the first step to minimize them .
We &apos;ve seen a picture of our blue planet , our World Bank .
But it &apos;s more than just a preservation for our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the unit that we call food .
So if we all take what we need , then we can start sharing the rest , we can start celebrating , we can start giving back .
We need to enjoy vegetables .
We need to have small portions on the seafood .
And we need to save the food .
Thank you .

Hi . I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world who makes a building out of paper , like this cardboard tube , and this is my first exhibition where I used paper tubes .
In 1986 , long before you started talking about ecology and environmental issues , I started testing paper tubes to build buildings .
It &apos;s very difficult to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than I expected to do and make lightly waterproof , and also to make an industrial tool hitchhiking .
And then in 1990 , I built a temporary construction .
This is the first made of paper temporary buildings .
There are 330 tubes with a diameter of 55 centimeters and only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , 12 feet .
As you see in the photo , it &apos;s the toilet inside .
If the toilet paper is out , you can tear something off the wall . ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s very practical .
In 2000 , a big expo in Germany .
They asked me to design a building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
I was selected to build a pavilion of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
My goal was not to make the building .
My goal was to reuse or recycle my building , because every country builds pavilions , and so after half a year , a lot of industrial waste .
The building was recycled later .
That was the goal of my design .
Then I was fortunate to win the competition for the second Centre Pompidou , in France , in the city of Metz .
I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but because I was so poor , I couldn &apos;t afford that , so I decided to take my students to Paris to build our office on the Centre Pompidou in Paris .
So we took paper tubes and bonding pieces of wood to build a 30-meter long office .
We stayed there six years without paying rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had a big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , even my friends had to buy a ticket to meet me .
That was the problem .
Then we finished the Centre Pompidou in metal .
Now it &apos;s a very popular museum ; I created a big construction memorial for the government .
But then I was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , contractors .
They have money and power .
These things are invisible .
So we &apos;re encouraged to make them visible by creating monumental architecture .
That &apos;s our job , historically , it was like this , and even now it is .
So I was very disappointed that we don &apos;t work for society , even though there are so many people who have lost their homes through natural disasters .
But I have to say that this is no longer about natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes don &apos;t kill people , falling buildings kill people .
That &apos;s the responsibility of the architects .
Then people need temporary shelters , but there are no architects working there because we &apos;re too busy working for privileged people .
I thought that as architects , we could also be involved in building temporary shelters .
We can do better than that .
So I started working in disaster areas .
In the great disaster in Rwanda in 1994 , Africa .
They fought the population groups of Hutu and Tutsi .
Over two million people have become refugees .
I was surprised to see the emergency services , refugee camps , organized by the U.N.
People are so poor , and they peer with ceiling in the rainy season , and in the United Nations , they only had to supply them with a plastic plan , and the refugees had to cut trees .
More than two million people were missing trees .
And this is how deforestation was produced in a large scale , an environmental problem .
That &apos;s why aluminum tube was ready , aluminum backing .
Very expensive , they &apos;re rejected for money , and then trees are cut again .
I proposed my idea of improving the situation through recycled paper tubes because they &apos;re so cheap and strong , and my budget per unit was only 50 U.S. dollars .
We built 50 units as a control test for consistency , humidity , termites , etc .
And then the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in Kobe in Japan .
Almost 7,000 people were killed and the city , like the Nagata district , burned after the earthquake .
I found that many Vietnamese refugees had suffered and gathered in a Catholic Church — the building was completely destroyed .
So I went there and I proposed to the priest , &quot; Why don &apos;t we build the church out of paper tubes again ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , are you crazy ?
After the fire you want to do that ? &quot; &quot; He didn &apos;t trust me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started to compete to Kobe , and I met with the violation of the Vietnamese .
They lived like this , with archaic plastic planners in the park .
I proposed the reconstruction . And I built capital .
I built shelters from paper tubes for them , so that the students could easily be built and easily rebuilt , I used as a foundation for beekeepers .
I remember the Bierfirm Chin , because the company Asahi made red plastic boxes at the time , and it doesn &apos;t fit into the color of the paper tubes .
The color mating is very important .
I remember we were expecting beer in the beer kits of plastic , but they came empty . ( Laughter ) I remember how disappointing this was .
In the summer , I built more than 50 units of the class with my students .
Finally , the priest trust me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can do that if you raise the money and bring the students to build . &quot; &quot; Five weeks ago , we spent the church rebuilding .
It should stay there for three years , but actually it turned out to be 10 years because people loved it .
Then there was a big earthquake in Taiwan , and we proposed to sticking this church , so we built it down , and we sent it down to be built by volunteers .
She stayed in Taiwan , and she &apos;s still there as a permanent church .
So this building became a permanent building .
So I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
Even a building of paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
Even a concrete building can be very temporary if it &apos;s made money .
After the great earthquake in Turkey in 1999 , I went there to build materials out of the ground .
In 2001 , I built a new class in Western India .
After the Sumatra-bearing and tsunami in 2004 in Sri Lanka , I rebuilt fisheries villages .
In 2008 , in Chengdu , in the Chinese province Sichuan , almost 70,000 people were killed , especially many schools were destroyed as a result of the corruption of authorities and developers .
I was commissioned to build a temporary church .
My Japanese students worked with Chinese students .
In one month , we finished nine shelters , more than 500 square meters .
This is still being used , even after the current earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , there was a big earthquake .
This is a very interesting photograph : the former prime minister of Berlusconi and Japan foremost prime minister , Mr. Aso — because every year we have to change a new prime minister .
They were very reliable and allowed my model .
My proposal was a big building , a temporary musician , because L &apos;s Aquila is very well known for music , and all the concert halls were destroyed so that musicians went on .
I proposed to the mayor to build a temporary concert hall .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can do that if you can bring money for that too . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Berlusconi brought the G8 summit to the city , our former prime minister came , and they helped us collect the money from the Japanese government , I got half a million euros to build this temporary concert hall .
In 2010 , there was a big earthquake in Haiti . It was impossible to fly there , so I flew to Santo Domingo next to Santo Domingo and drove six hours to Haiti to build with the students in Santo Domingo 50 units of the emergency room from papercutting .
This happened two years ago in the north of Japan .
After earthquakes and tsunami , people had to evacuate and be collected in large rooms , like sports halls .
Look at this , there are no private sector .
People suffer mental and physical .
With the students as volunteers , we went there and built pieces of paper tubes , simple shelters with a scaffolding of tubes and supplements .
The administrators of some of these institutions didn &apos;t want us to do this because it would be more difficult for them to get people under control .
But this is really needed .
There are not enough flat spaces to build like this .
Look at this . Even the government is building temporary buildings so bad , so dense , so dense , so confused because there &apos;s no layering tree that holds water — so I thought about building multi-story buildings because there &apos;s not enough land and it &apos;s not habitable .
So I suggested this to the mayor while I was building departments .
Finally , I met a very friendly mayor in the village of Onagawa in Miyagi .
He asked me to build on baseball fields three story buildings .
And I used fractcontainers and students helped build furniture to make it habitable . Everything is the government budget , the area that takes the house is the same , but it &apos;s much more habitable .
Many people want to stay here forever .
I &apos;m very excited to hear that .
Now I work in New Zealand in Christchurch .
About 20 days before the earthquake in Japan , there was also a big earthquake in which a lot of Japanese students came around and destroyed the most significant cathedral of the launch , and the truth of Christchurch was completely destroyed .
They asked me to come and build a temporary cathedral .
This is still in construction .
I also want to continue building monuments that are loved by the people .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
What &apos;s going on in the mind of this baby ?
If you had asked people 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have answered that this baby was unlogical , egocentric — that it could not take the view of another person or understand the cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , the science of development has completely fallen this picture .
So in a way , we believe that this baby thinks of as the most brilliant scientists .
Let me just give you an example .
One of the things that this baby could think about , what could happen in his head would be that it &apos;s trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the head of the other baby .
Finally , one of the most difficult things for all of us is to figure out what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the most difficult thing to understand is that what other people think and don &apos;t feel exactly what we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s pursuing politics can witness how difficult it is for certain people .
We wanted to know if babies and small children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is , how could we ask them ?
Finally , babies can &apos;t speak , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what he thinks , you get a beautiful stream of consciousness over Ponys and birthday and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them this question ?
Well , it turns out that the secret of Broccoli is called .
What we did — Betty Rapacholi , one of my graduate students , and I — we gave the babies two bowl of food : a bowl of raw broccoli , and a bowl of empty gold fishermen .
Now , all the babies , even the ones in Berkley , like the crabs , but not the raw broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then Betty got a little bit out of both bowl .
And it was like it tasted you , or not .
So she did half the way she liked the crabs and not the broccoli — like a baby or any other normal person .
But at the other half , she tried a little broccoli , and she said , &quot; &quot; Mmm , broccoli .
I tried the broccoli . Mmm . &quot; &quot; And then she tried a little bit of the crabs , and she said , &quot; &quot; Pfui , Igitt , crumber .
I tried the crumbs . Pfui , Igitt . &quot; &quot; So she was acting as if she wanted exactly the opposite of what the baby was tasting .
We did this with 15- and 18-month babies .
And then she just whipped out her hand and said , &quot; Can you give me some of that ? &quot;
Now the question is : What would the baby give her what tasted them or what you tasted ?
And the remarkable thing was that the 18-month babies who were able to walk with garbage and distress , they gave her the crabs if you fell those , but you gave the broccoli if they tasted her .
However , the 15-month babies staggered her long when she did , as though she liked broccoli , as if they couldn &apos;t understand that .
But after they stare for a long time , they just gave her the crabs they thought they had to like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first is that these 18-month babies have already found this really profound fact about human nature that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And also , they felt that they should do things to help other people get what they wanted .
But what &apos;s even more remarkable is that the fact that 15-month babies did not do that suggests that these 18-month babies had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months after their first 15 months of life .
So children know and learn more than we could have ever thought .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies in the last 20 years that actually shows this .
Now the question that you may ask is , why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , at the end of the day when we look at babies on the surface , they seem pretty useless .
And in fact , they &apos;re completely useless in many ways , because we have to spend so much time and energy just to keep them alive .
But if we turn to evolution to answer the mystery of why we spend so much time on useless babies , it turns out there &apos;s actually an answer to that .
If we look at the many , many different species of animals , not only do we find primates , but also other mammals , birds , even mammals , like kangaroo and bats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between the length of the childhood of a species and the size of their brains compared to their bodies , and how clever and flexible they are .
And a kind of parademia for this idea is the birds up there .
On the one hand , there &apos;s a sniff crow .
And crabs and other crabs , cows , lawn , lawn and so on , are incredibly smart birds .
In some ways , they &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees .
And this is a bird on the front page of science learning how to feed it .
On the other hand , here we have our friend , the household .
And chickens , ducks , geese and truthahne are basically as dumb as bean rows .
They &apos;re very , very good at picking grains , and nothing else is very good .
Now , it turns out that the babies , the babies , the babies of the German snakes , are cows .
They depend on their mothers who spend two years putting worms in their little open coins , which is a really long time in a bird &apos;s life .
Whereas the chickens are ripe within a few months .
So childhood is the reason why cruts end up on the cover of science , and the chickens in the soup top .
So it &apos;s a relationship between a long childhood and knowledge and learning .
What an explanation could we have for this ?
Well , some animals , like the chickens , seem to be appropriate to only do one thing particularly well .
So they seem to be best designed to pile grains in an environment .
Other creatures , like the cruts , can &apos;t do anything very well , but are extremely good at learning the laws of different environments .
And of course , we humans are at the very end of this distribution , like the wires .
We have bigger brains compared to our bodies , with great distance to the other animals .
We &apos;re smarter , flexible , we can learn more , we survive in different environments , we went out to eliminate the world and even fly into space .
And our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies of every other species .
My son is 23.
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still putting these worms into these little open coins .
All right , why do we see that connection ?
Now , one idea is that this strategy , this learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy to move on in the world , but it has a big disadvantage .
And that one big disadvantage is that until you actually learn all this , you &apos;ll be helpless .
So you don &apos;t want to see the predator going down to you and saying , &quot; A brick shield or maybe a spear could help . What would be better ? &quot;
You want to know all this before the rivers actually come up .
And evolution seems to have solved this problem with a kind of working force .
The idea is that we all have this spring where we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we need to do is learn .
And then , as an adult , we can take all these things that we learned as babies and children and basically send them to work to do things out in the world .
So one way of thinking would be that babies and small children are like the research and development department of human species .
They are the protective idealists who just go out into the world and have to have good ideas , and we are the production and marketing department .
We need to take all these ideas that we learned when we were kids and actually implement them .
Another way to think about it is to look at babies and children not as incomplete adults , but in a different stage of development , but in the same species — in something like caterpillars and butterflies — just that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies flying around in the garden and chatting out , and we &apos;re the caterpillars that slowly move on our narrow , adult path .
If that &apos;s true , if babies are determined to learn — and this evolutionary history would say that children are there to learn , if they &apos;re determined for it — we might expect them to have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , a baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But in fact , real computers are going to get much better .
And there was a revolution in our understanding of machine learning .
And everything is dependent on the ideas of this man , Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
And what Bayes did essentially was to point out a mathematical way , using probability theory to characterize , describe how scientists explore the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that appears to be possible , and they start with it .
They start with it and test it against measurement .
The finding causes them to change the hypothesis .
Then they test this new hypothesis , and so on and so on .
And Bayes showed a mathematical way to do that .
And this mathematics is at the center of the best machine learning programs that we have today .
And about 10 years ago , I claimed babies would do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on behind these beautiful brown eyes , I think of it like this .
This is Reverend Bayes Notitbook .
I think these babies actually do complicated calculations with unrelated probabilities that correct them to figure out how the world works .
Well , it may be even more demanding to prove that .
Because ultimately , even if you ask adults about statistics , these are extremely stupid .
So how do children make statistics ?
To test that , we used a machine that we called the Licket Detector .
This is a box that glows and plays music when you put the right things on them .
And with this very simple machine , my lab and other dozens of studies have shown how good babies are when it comes to learning more about the world .
Let me just mention a study that we did with Tumar Kushner , my students .
If I were to show you this detector , you &apos;d probably think you could activate it by putting a block on the detector .
But this detector works in a slightly strange way .
Because if you move a block above the detector , something you would never get to at the beginning , the detector will automatically activate in two out of three cases .
Whereas the detector , if you do the probability and put the block on it , only in two out of six cases activated .
So the unlikely hypothesis has a clearer resilience .
It looks like the reference and moving is a more effective strategy than the other .
So here &apos;s what we did : we gave four-year-old this pattern in the Indians , and we just asked them to make the detector work .
And really , the four-year-old used the evidence to move the object above the detector and back .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first is , again , remember , these are four-year-old .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they look at these pretty complicated calculations that give them an unconditional probability rate .
And the other interesting thing is that they used this clue to get an idea of keeping a hypothesis about the world that you probably wouldn &apos;t start with very much .
And in studies that we &apos;ve just done in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve shown that four-year-olds are actually better at making unlikely hypotheses than adults , if we give them the same task .
So among these circumstances , the children use statistics to figure out how the world works , but ultimately scientists do experiments , and we wanted to see if kids do experiments .
When kids experiment , we call this &quot; &quot; play into everything &quot; &quot; in terms of &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; And recently , there were a bunch of interesting studies that showed that this heritage actually is a kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s one from the lab at Cristine Legare .
Cristine used our licket detector .
And she has shown kids that the yellow ones did it work , and the red ones don &apos;t , and then he showed them an anomaly .
And you &apos;ll see that the little boy will go through five hypotheses at the time of two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : How about that ?
Same as the other side .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , his first hypothesis was just evicted .
( Laughter ) Boy : This is what lit up , this is not .
AG : Okay , he generated his experimental notebook .
Boy : What makes this light up here ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will know that expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because it has to be that way , and it has to be that way .
AG : Okay , second hypothesis .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG : So this is his next idea .
He asked the experimentatorin to do that , to try and put it on the other side .
It doesn &apos;t work either .
Boy : Oh , the light just lights up there , not here .
Oh , the floor of this box has electricity in it , and this one has no electricity .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It lights up .
So if you put four on it .
So you put four on it to light it up and two on those to make it light up .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now this is special — this is a particularly lovely and referred little boy , but what Cristine discovered is actually quite typical .
If you look at how kids play , if you ask them to explain something to you , they actually do a series of experiments .
It &apos;s actually quite typical of four-year-old .
Now , how about being such a creature ?
How about being one of these great butterflies that can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
So let &apos;s go back to these psychologists and philosophers , many of them have said that babies and little children are barely aware of when they &apos;re aware of themselves .
And I think that &apos;s exactly the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of themselves than we adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about the awareness of adults .
And attention and awareness of adults sort of looks like a shepherd .
So for us adults , we decide whether something is relevant or important , whether we should pay attention to it .
Our awareness of this thing becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else becomes as dark .
And we even know something about the way our brain does that .
So what happens when we start to pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , which is actually the leading part of our brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain much more flexible , more malleable , more adaptive , and it transforms activity in the rest of our brain .
So we have a very focused , fueled , fueled kind of attention .
If we look at babies and little children , we see something very different .
I think babies and small kids seem to have a lateral of consciousness than a shame of consciousness .
So babies and small kids are bad at focusing on a more choice .
But they &apos;re very good at recording a lot of information from a lot of different sources at the same time .
And if you actually look inside their brains , you can see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are very good at producing learning and plastic , and the retarding parts haven &apos;t come into play yet .
So if we say babies and small kids can be bad at this , we actually think they &apos;re bad at being accurate .
So they &apos;re bad at solving all the interesting things that might tell them something , and focusing only on the important thing .
And this is the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness that we might expect from these butterflies that were designed to learn .
Now , if we want to think about a way to think of ourselves as an adult , an image of the conscious mind of a baby , I think the best way to think about cases where we &apos;ve been brought to a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — if we fall in love with somebody , or when we &apos;re in a new city we &apos;ve never met for the first time .
And then it doesn &apos;t contract our consciousness , but it expands , so those three days in Paris seem intense to be more aware and experience than all the months in which we were a transformative , talking at home , at teacher conferences , were part of the zoombie .
And by the way , this coffee , this beautiful coffee that you drink down there mimics the effect of this baby neurotransmitter .
So how about being a baby ?
It &apos;s like having fallen in love and drowned three times in Paris for the first time , and three doubled Espressi .
( Laughter ) So living is fantastic , but it tends to wake up at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Up , it &apos;s good to be an adult .
I don &apos;t want to talk too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
We can crack things like our fingerprints and cross the road alone .
And it makes sense that we &apos;re very engaging to get babies to think like adults .
But if we want to be like these butterflies , closed and open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , at least sometimes , we should get adults to think more like children .

I want to tell you the story of how it came about becoming the HIV / AIDS activist .
And this is the name of my campaign , the SINGO campaign .
In November 2003 , I was invited to launch Nelson Mandela &apos;s 4664 Foundation , which is his HIV / AIDS Foundation .
And 4664 is the number Mandela wore when he was in Robben Island in prison .
And here I am with Youssou N &apos;Dour on the stage , where I was badly amused .
The next day , all the artists were invited to meet Mandela on Robben Island , where he held a conference before the World press , and he was standing before his former prison cell .
You can see the grid of the window there .
It was an event for all of us , of quite a big stretch .
In that moment , Mandela shared the world press that basically a genocide takes place in his country , that in the rainbow nation after the end of apartheid , thousands die every day , and that the victims are primarily the most vulnerable of all , namely women and children .
This made a big impression for me , because I &apos;m a woman , and I &apos;m a mother , and I didn &apos;t realize that HIV / AIDS pandemic was just about women .
And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Cape Town , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s one thing I have to talk about .
I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been involved since every single 4664 event that I could participate in , and I held press conferences , there were interviews , talking about it , using my platform as a musician for my commitment to Mandela from respect to the enormous , incredible work he &apos;d done .
Everybody in the world respects Nelson Mandela . Everybody hides Nelson Mandela .
But do you all know what &apos;s happening in South Africa right now in its country , the country with the most frequent cases of transmission of the virus ?
I think now , if I went out into the street and told people what was going on , they were shocked .
A few years later , I was very lucky to meet Zackie Achmat , the founder of the Treatment Action campaign , an incredible fighter and activist .
I met him at a 4664 event .
He wore a shirt like this that I started .
This is a tool . It says that I &apos;m more solid with people wearing the HIV virus , people living with HIV .
And in a way , because of the stigma , I say , if I wear this shirt , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about it .
It doesn &apos;t have to be secret . &quot; &quot; I became a member of the Treatment Action campaign , and I &apos;m very proud that I &apos;m a member of this incredible organization .
It &apos;s a grassroots campaign where 80 percent of the members are women , most of them are HIV-positive .
They work on the ground .
They achieve an enormous impact on the people who live directly with the consequences of the virus .
They have imaging programs .
They bring the problems of stigma to the surface .
What they do is quite extraordinary .
And yes , my SINGO campaign has funded the Treatment Action campaign by trying to build awareness and trying to raise resources .
Many of the donations I was able to raise were flown directly into the Treatment Action campaign and the incredible work that she &apos;s doing and continue to conduct in South Africa .
So this is my SINGO campaign .
The SIH campaign basically consists of me and about three or four wonderful people helping support me .
In the last two and a half years , I &apos;ve traveled all over the world . I &apos;ve been in about 12 different countries .
Here I am in Oslo , Norway , a nice , fat check , singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise donors .
In Johannesburg , I got the opportunity to join a predominantly white South African Central class audience , who ended up with tears , because I used film clips that really go to the heart , the full scale of these terrible tragedies that would take place that people would love to push because they &apos;re tired , and they really don &apos;t know the solution .
Aaron Motsoaledi , the current minister of health , visited this concert , and I had the opportunity to meet him , and he gave his connective substance that he would try to make a change that is absolutely necessary .
This is in the Scottish parliament .
And then I became an ambassador for Scotland and HIV .
And I shared my experiences with them and tried to rebuild a conscious mind .
And again , in Edinburg , with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir , I just recommend .
And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom live in orphanages , because their family is affected by the AIDS virus .
This is me sitting in New York with Michel Sidibe . He &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
And I &apos;m very honored that Michel invited me just a few months ago to become UNAIDS ambassador .
And in that way , I strengthen my platform and I strengthen my return .
The message that UNAIDS is spreading in the world right now is that we want to be able to eliminate the transmission of mother to child to child by 2015 .
This is a very ambitious goal , but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
It &apos;s to create .
And here I am with a pregnant woman who is HIV-positive , and we &apos;re smiling , we &apos;re both smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that this young woman has a treatment that can extension her life so that she can take care of the baby she &apos;s born .
And her baby will get PMTCT , which means that this baby can be born without infecting with the virus .
Well , this is precaution at the beginning of life .
It &apos;s a way of intervention against the AIDS pandemic .
Well , I &apos;d like to end by telling you the short story of Avelile .
This is Avelile . She &apos;s with me wherever I go .
I tell everyone their story , because it stands for one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
Aveliles &apos;s mother had the HIV virus . She died of a disease associated with AIDS .
Avelile had the virus . She was born with the virus .
And here it is at the age of seven , not harder than a one-year-old baby .
At this point of her life , her AIDS disease had completely broken out , and she had a pneumonia .
We met them in a hospital on the East Coast , and we spent a whole afternoon with her — a beating child .
The doctors and nurses were great .
They put them on a very specific nutritional diet , and they treated them with great care .
And when we left the hospital , we didn &apos;t know — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So it was obvious — it was a very emotional encounter , and this direct experience , this one child , you know , this one story , called very excited feelings with us .
Five months later , we visited South Africa again to see Avelile .
And I get — the hair on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hair on my arms .
They &apos;re up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you now .
This is the change that had occurred .
Isn &apos;t that extraordinary ?
( Applause ) This applause actually deserves the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
And I suspect you know this kind of change .
So I would say that everyone in the audience , if you think that every mother and child in the world have the right to have access to good nutrition and good health care , and if you believe that all governments in the world — especially those in sub-Saharan Africa — the Millennium Development , number five and six , commitment , would you please stand up .
I think it &apos;s appropriate to say that almost all of these are in the room .
Thank you .

Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers moved a large object secretly through the driverless landscape .
With the object , they hoped to attract everybody &apos;s attention by being the first to conquer space .
The rocket was huge .
And in her top , a silver customer was installed , which contained two radio devices .
On October 4th , 1957 , they started their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists at the time wrote , &quot; &quot; We are basically going to create a new planet that we &apos;re going to call Sputnik .
In the old days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus were fortunate to unlock the globe .
Now we are fortunate to unlock space .
And the ones in the future are supposed to be about our joy in the same way . &quot; &quot; They look at excerpts from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary film that was just finished .
He tells the story of Sputnik and the story of what happened as a result of that with America .
And days after the launch , Sputnik was an amazing object of curiosity .
When a human-made moon that could be seen by average citizens , he inspired to awe and pride that humanity had finally sent an object to space .
But only three days later , on a day they called Roter Monday , the media and politicians told us — and we believed it — that Sputnik was proof that our adversary had beaten us , in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs by using their Sputnik rocket as trusses .
All the world was head .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks that America met — according to historians in the same way as Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
It was a trigger for the discrepancy in the evolution of rockets .
It triggered a weather race .
It triggered space race .
Within a year , Congress funded extensive revelations so that we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
But the responses to Sputnik traveled much further than a weather race .
For example , some people here will remember that one day in June 1958 , the National Civil Conservation , where several tens of millions of people went underground in 78 cities .
Or the opinion polls that showed that seven out of 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war was happening , and that would die at least 50 percent of our population .
But Sputnik also made wonderful changes .
For example , some people in this room will have gone to school thanks to Sputnik .
The recovery of engineering , mathematics and science — education in total — boomed .
And Vint Cerf emphasizes that Sputnik has immediately led to ARPA and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
My documentation shows how a free society can be put in panic that know how to use the media .
But it also shows how we can use something that looks at the first time as a bad situation , into something that , in fact , was very good for America .
Sputnik is soon published .
Finally , I &apos;d like to use the moment and thank one of my investors : TED Veteran Jay Walker .
And I want to thank you all .

Thank you , Chris .

Good morning . Magic is a great way to be ahead of the reality curve , to make today possible what science really makes tomorrow possible .
As a cyber magician , I &apos;m connecting the elements of illusion with science to give us a sense of how future technologies might be experienced .
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look through these glasses and you see the world expanding through data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe someday even the names of strangers that face you on the street .
This is now my illusion glasses .
It &apos;s a little bit bigger . It &apos;s a prototype .
And if you look down , you can look at the thought of a cyber illusionist .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a game map , any kind of card .
Like this . I &apos;m going to mark them now so we can see them when we see them again .
All right . A very famous sign .
Now we put them back in the stack somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s start .
( Music ) Voice : System ready . Stop picture .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t know , a carrot is made up of four different colors : heart , cross , diamonds and spades .
The cards are among the oldest symbols , and they were interpreted in very different ways .
Now , some say that the four colors are the four seasons .
There &apos;s Spring , summer , fall and ... Voice : My favorite season is winter . MT : My own .
Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change when heat becomes cold , water to snow , and everything disappears .
There are 13 maps in every color . ( Music ) Voice : Every card is for a phase of 13 moon cycles .
MT : So over here is Ebbe , over here is tide , and in the middle is the moon .
Voice : The moon is one of the most powerful symbols of magic .
MT : There are two colors in the carrot .
There &apos;s the color in red , and the color is black , they stand for the constant change from day to night .
Voice : Marco , I didn &apos;t know you can do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that 52 cards are in a carrot , just like there are 52 weeks a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you put all the dots in a card , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days a year , the number of days between every birthday .
Do you want something . ( Pustgering ) Voice : Don &apos;t guess it or it &apos;s not about fulfilling .
MT : Well , actually , on my sixth birthday , I got my first card game , and since that day , I &apos;ve traveled around the world to clean up , for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are they ? MT : Ah , rubber . See .
Get up .
Joker : Hey . MT : Are you ready for your performance ?
Joker : Ready ! MT : Tell me what you got on it .
Joker : I present my jump stick . MT : Ah . Pass up .
Joker : Hey , hey , hey , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today I &apos;m heading for a very different audience .
I &apos;ll meet you .
Voice : Common card recognized . MT : Well , sometimes people ask me , &quot; How did you become a magician ? Did you have excellent work time ? &quot;
Of course not ! You have to practice around the clock .
I don &apos;t mean literally 24 hours , seven days a week .
Rand around the clock is a little bit exaggerated , but you need practice . Well , some people will say magic must be the work of a bad , overnatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Hey .
So , I &apos;m just saying , no , no .
In German , it actually says &quot; &quot; no no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Magic is not so strong , but I have to warn you if you ever play with someone who gives the cards this way , don &apos;t play for money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good sheet .
The odds for such a sheet are at 4.165 to one .
MT : Yeah , but I think my hand is better than all probability .
Voice : Your birthday congratulations went into fulfillment . MT : And that actually brings me to the last and most important map of all : the map with the very famous sign .
And unlike anything we just saw , virtually or not . Voice : recognized the map of the card .
Digital MT : That &apos;s the real map without question .
MT : Bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years . I &apos;ve been at TED I .
And the third is slightly less obvious .
Did they all agree ? No , not quite .
I buy that . I have so much money .
I have so much money , it will take forever .
I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six , coming home and finding a small car full of candy in front of our front door .
My brother and I fell over it , and my father came home .
He was out of anger , and we cried when the car was pulled away with the half-beaten candy from us .
I later understood why my father was so upset .
The sweet was a gift of a developer who hoped to get a government assignment from my father .
My father led to the street building in Bihar , and he had said , despite ships and threats of corruption , the fight .
It was a lonely battle , because Bihar was also the most corrupt state of India , and officials were preparing themselves instead of serving the poor who couldn &apos;t sue their suffering if their children didn &apos;t have food or schooling .
I experienced this in my own suffering when I was traveling in remote villages to study poverty .
At that time , I traveled from village to village , and I remember one day when I was very hungry , exhausted , and the resemblance close to a tree in bright heat , and I was invited by one of the poorest men in this village to his hut , and I was kindly accustomed .
Later on , I realized that what I had eaten was two days of his whole family &apos;s journey .
Through this really generous gift , I questioned the meaning of my life and changed it .
I decided to help others .
Later , I worked for the World Bank that was struggling to fight this poverty by transferring aid from the rich to the poor countries .
My first job was focused on Uganda , where I led to the Minister of Finance to reform access to our credit .
But after spending the loans , I found myself on a journey to Uganda rebuilt schools without textbooks and without teachers , new clinics without medication and poor again without native or return .
It was just like in Bihar .
Bihar is the difficulty of developing work : sufficient poverty in the middle of corruption .
Worldwide , 1.3 billion people live on less than 1.25 dollars a day , and the work that I did in Uganda shows how to deal with these problems traditionally . This process has been practiced since 1944 , when the winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers and a founding mother , in New Hampshire , United States , came together to call the Bretton Woods , which is the World Bank .
This traditional process of development has three elements : First , the resource rider of rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south , combined with reforestation .
Secondly , the transfer conductive development institutions , with just a little bit of transparency on what was funded or what results were achieved .
Third , the commitment in developing countries led a small elite group of government members with very little contact to the population , the low-cost of aid .
Today , these elements become more open through dramatic twists in the global environment .
Open knowledge , open aid , open government , are the three big changes that are changing development now , and this makes me hope that the problems that I saw in Uganda and Bihar can be solved .
The first big change is open knowledge .
Today , developing countries don &apos;t just accept the solutions that they get proposed by the United States , Europe or the World Bank .
They get inspiration , hope and practical know-how of successful emerging economies in the south .
They want to know how China has managed to liberate 500 million people from poverty in 30 years , how the Oportunity program in Mexico has improved schooling and nutrition of millions of children .
This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge that flows not only north to south , but also from south to south , and even south to north , as Mexico &apos;s Oportunity program is now inspired by the city of New York .
And with the rising north-south transfers opening up the developmental institutions that guide these transfers .
The second key element is open aid .
Recently , the World Bank provided their databases to the public , there were 8,000 economic and social indicators of 200 countries and 50 years free and landed a global crowdsourcing competition for innovative apps that are using this data .
Development institutions today also enable the public examination of the project funding .
For example , geomapping . In this map of Kenya , red dots are shown by funding schools , and the dark the green is , the more kids don &apos;t go to school .
This simple surveillance shows that donors in areas where the least kids go to school have no schools funded , and this raises new questions : Does aid the ones they need most ?
So in this way , the World Bank now uses geomapping for 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and donors use this common platform to track all their projects .
This is a quantum leap for transparency and accountability of aid .
So by the third , and I think the most important thing , the most important change in the development , the open government , governments are opening up , just as the population lifts their voice and demands accountability .
From the Arab Spring to the Anna-Hazaran movement in India , mobile phones and social media are not only used for political accountability , but also for the accountability in aid .
Those governments of their population ?
Some governments in Africa and Eastern Europe , for example , make their budgets available publicly .
But it &apos;s a big difference whether a budget is accessible or easy to look at .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) As you can see , it &apos;s not really available or consistent for a normal citizen trying to understand government spending .
To address this problem , governments use new tools that graphic budgets and make them so intelligible .
On this map of Moldawiens , green districts , spending little money on schools , but good educational outcomes come , and red shows the opposite .
Tools like this are made out of a shelf full of incompetent documents of accessible , understandable visual material , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , citizens have new ways of giving feedback and putting themselves in .
Today , parents and students in the Philippines can provide feedback on a website in real time , on Checkmyol.org , or text messages , whether teachers and textbooks are in school , problems like they were in Uganda and Bihar back then .
And the government responds to that . For example , when the government was reported on this website , that 800 students were in danger because repairs were brought to school because of corruption to gridlock , the Ministry of Education in the Philippines quickly did things .
The best thing about this innovation is that it &apos;s passed from south to south , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldawia and beyond .
In Dar Salaam , Tanzania , even a devastated community could use these tools to express their wishes .
This is the map of Tandale in August 2011 , but in a few weeks , students with mobile phones and an open-source platform could make a map that shows the whole infrastructure of their community .
The exciting thing about this is that citizens can give feedback , where health care centers or water sites don &apos;t work , as you can see here on the red dots together represent a graphic visualization of the collective voice of the poor .
Today even Bihar changes and opens up with a dedicated government that makes decisions transparent and responds to the needs of the poor .
But in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or serving the poor , and this is a real challenge for the people who want to change the system .
These are one-on-one fighters , like my father and many , many others , and it &apos;s a major assignment for development to help these lonely warriors handle their forces so that they can handle together the tasks .
For example , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , parliament and government have gone into a coalition to close transparent contracts in the oil sector , and as a result , reformers in Parliament are now starting to cover dubious contractions .
These examples let me hope that there are new ways of addressing the problems that I saw in Uganda and faced with my father in Bihar .
Two years ago , April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was late in the night , and he was at the end of his 80 years creating a sieb-sized public policy about corruption in a street building project .
Even though he &apos;s not a lawyer , the next day he was defending this case himself from trial . He won the process , but later that same evening , he fell and died .
He fought until the end , passionately convinced that the fight against corruption and poverty is not just the honor of government officials , but also the collective of citizens to be heard of their concerns .
These were the two maximum of his life , and the journey that he started on , reflected the changing developing world .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m glad the World Bank has stripped these new directions , a clear difference in my work in Uganda from 20 years ago .
We need to radically open development so that knowledge is spreading in all directions , and those who are inspiring the development work so that aid is transparent , replicable and effective , that governments will open up and citizens are empowered and empowered with reformers within the government .
We need to accelerate these changes .
If we do that , the collective voices of the poor will also be heard in Bihar and also in Uganda and beyond .
In schools , there will be teachers and teachers for the kids .
We &apos;ll see that these kids also have a real opportunity to overcome their poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Babies don &apos;t die anymore .
Now take a minute .
Get to your seat seat .
Just raise your hand .
Please give each other the hand .
Learn to know .
They actually look pretty nice .
But what if I tell you that the person who just gave you the hand didn &apos;t wash your hands when he got off the toilet ? ( Laughter ) Suddenly , they all don &apos;t look so nice , right ?
Very disgusting , you agree with me .
Why ? Is there no soap ?
But , in fact , there are soap .
In 90 percent of the households in India , and in 94 percent of the households in Kenya , there are soap .
Even in the walls where the least soap is like in Ethiopia , we &apos;re 50 percent .
So what is it about ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
What is it that Mayank , the little boy from India , doesn &apos;t handle hands ?
In Mayanks family , soap is used for bathroom , soap is used for laundry washing , soap is used for storm flags .
They don &apos;t give it to him so he doesn &apos;t waste them .
Where did you learn to wash your hands ?
Have you learned at home to wash your hands ?
Have you learned in school to wash your hands ?
However , we mimic what others do and local , cultural norms can change our behavior , and at this point the private sector comes in .
The belief in this , connected to the size of Unilever , continues to allow us to talk to these mothers about dog washing with soap and hygiene .
Think about it : tailers spend all their time trying to move from one brand to another .
The budget is not always enough .
In short , the funders of public health are actually dependent on soap firms so that handbags will continue to praise with soap .
It &apos;s a profit for the private sector , because we raise new generations of hands in the future .
But the greatest benefit is the people who are particularly vulnerable .
Most of the discussions are still going online .
I &apos;m from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
Our family conversation at dinner was always about social justice .
I studied in Europe &apos;s leading college for health .
We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
Some of you may remember hearing business growth and saved lives in a certain way in the same sentence , but only through business growth , we can extend our activity .
Just without talking about it alone , we can &apos;t make the change we need .
Last week , my team and I visited mothers who have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
I &apos;m a mother . I can &apos;t imagine anything more overwhelming and more painful .
It comes from Myanmar .
It has the most sound smile , the smile that gives you life if you get a second chance .
Her son Myo is her second chance .
It &apos;s the greatest invention of public health .
I hope you &apos;ll do it to us and wash hands in part of your daily life and all of our lives and help kids like Myo to experience their fifth birthday .
Thank you .

These are simple objects : ears , keys , tribes , glasses .
The victims of the genocide in Bosnia were carrying this on their last trip .
They were told , by the way , that they were going to be tracked against war prisoners .
It &apos;s probably the biggest one ever discovered .
During the four-year conflict that destroyed Bosnia from the early &apos; 90s , about 300,000 citizens , largely civilians , who were probably killed , and more than 100,000 died during the war negotiations .
The International Criminal Court hired a series of judgments for crime against humanity and genocide .
Just as the genocide is about killing .
It &apos;s also about the destruction of property , its cultural heritage , and ultimately the idea that they never existed .
The genocide is not just about killing , but about the denial of identity .
There are always traces — there &apos;s no perfect crime .
There are always remains of the deceased that recover their fragile bodies and our selective and devastating memory of them .
No one body should remain unborn or unified .
Thousands of objects are done in white plastic bags , just like the ones you see at CSI .
These objects are used to medically identify the victim &apos;s visual identification , but they also use them as very valuable evidence in the ongoing war processes .
Among survivors are asked to identify these objects personally , but manual vision is very difficult , an inefficient and painful process .
Many of them are destroyed if you believe it or not , or just paralyzed , from your eyes , from your point of view .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single one of the exhumed pieces to make a visual archive that the survivors can just see through .
As a storyteller , I want to give back to the community a little bit .
I don &apos;t just want to create a conscious mind .
In this case , someone could recognize these objects , or at least remain with the photos as permanent , valuable and accurate reminder of what happened .
Photography is about empathy and the familiarity of these objects guaranteed empathy .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a forensic tool , so the result is a photography that &apos;s almost like a document .
In their whole simplicity , the objects are the last testimony of the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people have existed at all .

So I want to show you something that I &apos;ve been working on .
I learned some things during this 30-day challenge .

I &apos;ve never been so adventurous .

In fact , they &apos;re a great fun .

Hi . So I want to introduce you to some work that &apos;s going on today .
Since we &apos;re still working on the projects , we &apos;re still working in an area of intuition and mystery .
So I &apos;m going to try and describe some insights that we &apos;re looking for in each of these works .
The first piece is called Imperial Monochromes .
A viewer somehow goes into the room in a way , and puts a glimpse of sheets in a chaotic composition on the wall .
Within seconds , as if the blackboards had noticed the presence of the viewer , they seem to be panicked and arranged in tough symmetry .
( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
We wanted to see how little change needed to get from one state to another .
This also reminded us of two very different images .
One is the 15th century albums , and the other one is about 100 years ago , Malewitch &apos;s abstract compositions .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a video now .
That &apos;s about that much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
So the viewer enters the space , and they immediately turn out .
And after a while , if the viewer continues to stay in the room , somehow the blackboards become immune to the presence of the viewer and become neglected and self-confident again until they notice a kind of presence in the room or a movement , they immediately reverse .
( Laughter ) So here it seems like it &apos;s the viewer that somehow initiates the sense of order between the blackboard , but it might also be the other way that the blackboards are trapped in their pre-programmed behavior , that they sort of push the viewer into the role of a tyranny .
So this instability in motion mimics very well the wacky sculptor , as he &apos;s observed by a camera .
Here I &apos;m going to show you two Tandemic clips .
One was taken with a fixed camera , and the other one was taken with a camera .
And you see immediately the wacky character of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective view .
So we just removed the camera and transmitted that movement to the blackboard .
And here &apos;s the video .
The other hand , you have to imagine , it &apos;s not there now .
But what we &apos;re trying to do is sort of call back a lasting gestion , like there &apos;s a little person with extended arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
That &apos;s kind of comparable to the degree of load , to be in service of the observer , and presenting the viewer in front of this piece of paper very graphic .
The next work is a lure .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about the size of me .
It has a disconnected body , two arms and a very large head-like antenna , and its only purpose is to attract attention .
So when a viewer walks by , it kind of wakes up and forth in a little bit and moves his arms over and over again as the closer the person gets .
Here &apos;s the first test scenario .
You see the two movements integrated , and the object is busy expressing this expression of despair .
Once it has the attention of the person , it &apos;s no longer interested in it , and it &apos;s looking for the next person .
It looks like it &apos;s from a mass production , like it came from a factory , like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
Since we &apos;re always working out of a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetics sort of deprives the object and gives us a little distance , at least in the appearance .
And so for us , it &apos;s a kind of finite creature that &apos;s trying to get you away from the things that really need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
The next piece is an object that is also a kind of music instrument .
It &apos;s in the form of an amphitheatologist , which is the size of a audience , how it &apos;s perceived by someone from the stage .
In the audience , 996 little characters are sitting there .
A mechanism enables them to clap from their own free will .
So if the viewer is in front of the audience , there &apos;s a reaction .
It could be all , from a poor hand of individual members from the audience or even very loud ovations .
So I think we really see an audience as an autonomous object or self-sufficient organism that just gives up some kind of musical quality , an instrument .
So the viewer can play it by creating quite complex and diverse , differentiated musical or acoustic patterns , but he can &apos;t really influence the audience in a certain kind of reaction .
So they &apos;re involved in the feelings of judgment and the incarceration and the awkwardness .
It also brings in a seductive and compelling quality .
So here , if you can see it , we &apos;re really excited about the image of how the minds split up to form the two hands .
So here &apos;s a little visual animation as if the two sides of the brain are hitting each other to somehow make sense through the duality and the tension .
And here &apos;s a prototype .
We can &apos;t wait to be swallowed by 996 .
Okay , that &apos;s the last piece . It &apos;s called Framerunner .
It comes out of the concept of a window .
This is actually a window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s composed of three different thick wooden sections .
So we &apos;ve used the same layer building to create our own frame or a grid that will then be attached to space and be looked at two sides .
This grid is occupied by a tribe of little characters .
They were also created in three different sizes to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on a single level .
Each of these characters can also walk backwards and hide forward in the tracks and hide behind two distinct tracks .
So in contrast to this very narrow grid , we wanted to give these characters a very strange and lap-like quality , as if a puppeteer is holding them and animating them physically on the path .
So we like the idea that the characters sort of shut down along , as if they were forgotten and innocent and worthless and satisfied until they realize a kind of movement of the observer and hide behind the next wall .
So for us , this piece shows its own paradox .
These characters are kind of trapped inside this very rigid grid , which is like a prison , but also like a foreground , because it allows them to forget themselves and be naive and careful and completely untouched by the outside world .
All of these qualities of real life that I &apos;m talking about are translated into a very special technical configuration , and we were very happy that we could work with the ETH Zurich .
So , it &apos;s really very small .
See , it could fit in my palm .
So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio .
( Applause )
This is what the year would look like .
But then a funny thing happened .
Anyway , today I &apos;m such a blogwriter guy .
It means everything is good until this happens .
In the animal kingdom , that works prime .
There &apos;s overlap .
I call it the dark playground .
Guess who was getting weak ?
It &apos;s not nice , but at the end it works .
Right ? I think all of you are procrastinators .
A box for every week in a 90 years of life .
We should all take a long , intense look at the calendar .
We have to stay aware of the Soforcement reward monkey .
That &apos;s a task for all of us .
Pretty soon .
Thank you .
That day , one unit of American and Afghan troops was on the way through a part of Afghanistan to protect a group of government officials ; Afghan officials who were on the way to a meeting with some of the villages .
The unit got into a halt , and it was surrounded by three sides , and among many other things , Captain Swenson was charged for running under his grasp to save wounded and hiding dead .
Among the rabbit , there was a sergeant that he took with a camera to a rescue helicopter .
The remarkable thing about that day was that one of the rescue doctors happened to have a helmet camera and filmed the whole scene .
You pick it up in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over him and gives him a kiss before he turns around to save others .
When I saw this , I wondered , where are these people coming from ?
What is that ? Those must be very deep feelings if you &apos;re willing to do something like this .
In the military , you teach people who are willing to sacrifice themselves to the well-being of others .
In the economy , we reward people willing to sacrifice others so that we win .
So we do it the other way around .
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; They all gave the same answer : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
And trust and cooperation are very important here .
The problem with terms like trust and cooperation is , they are emotions and no instructions .
I can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; trust me , &quot; &quot; and you trust me .
I can &apos;t tell two people to cooperate and they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s a feeling .
Where does that feeling come from ?
If we go back 50,000 years , to the Paleolithic , in the early days of Homo sapiens , we see a world full of dangers , and all of these forces were about to kill us .
That was not personal .
Whether it was the weather , the lack of resources , or a saddle-payoff , all of these things worked on the shortcut of our lifespan .
So we evolved to a social animal by living together and working in a safe circle , as I call it , in a tribe that we felt comfortable with .
And when we felt secure under our same secure , trust and cooperation was the natural response .
It has benefits .
It means that I can sleep at night and trust someone from my tribe is holding vigil .
It &apos;s a bad survival system .
It could be the uphill of the economy ; the uncertainty of the stock market .
Or a new technology that makes your business model obsolete .
It could be competitors who sometimes try to curate you .
It &apos;s hard to push out of the business , but at least work hard to stop your growth and steal your business .
The man was screened because he didn &apos;t believe in order .
So I said something .
&quot; &quot; Why do you treat us like livestock ?
Why don &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And the answer was this .
&quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t believe in the rules , I could get trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; So she said she doesn &apos;t feel safe . She said that .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we like to fly with Southwest Airlines is not necessarily that they hire better people .
If conditions don &apos;t vote , we have to spend our time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that automatically understands the organization .
The best analogy for what a good leader is , for me , parents .
What do you want from good parents ? What do they do ?
The child has opportunities , education and , if necessary to give discipline , so that it grows up and reaches more than we used it for us .
Great leaders want this .
They give people opportunities , education and gourt discipline , their confidence , their confidence , enable trial and failures so that they can achieve more than we could have imagined for ourselves .
Charlie Kim , the head of a company called Next Jump , a tech company in New York City , argued like this , &quot; &quot; If it went up in your family , have you ever wondered to let your child go ?
You would never do that .
So why do we think about disappointment in our companies ?
Charlie developed a concept of lifelong engagement .
If you work at Next Jump , you &apos;re not fired for performance problems .
In fact , someone who has problems will be delighted and will support how we do it for our child when it comes out of school with three .
That &apos;s why so many people have such anger in the belly , on some of these banking boards with their disproportionate salaries and bonuses .
It &apos;s not because of the numbers .
It &apos;s about basic leadership principles .
Knowing that they willingly sacrificed their people or even sacrificed their people to protect their interests .
Would anyone be insulted if you gave Ghandi a 150 million dollar bonus ?
What about a 250-million dollar bond for Mother Teresa ?
Would you have a problem with that ? Not at all .
Big leaders would never be people .
Because of the numbers , they sacrifice .
Before , they would sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
For such a company , that &apos;s a big deal . They couldn &apos;t afford their labor anymore .
It was about saving 10 million dollars , like many companies today , the board came together and discussed about disappointment .
But Bob rejected .
Because mobs are not the size of Belegation .
Coobs scale is the heart size , and it &apos;s much harder to rationalize cardiac size .
So they designed a vacation program .
All the staff , from the secretary to the boss , had to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
They could take him when they wanted , and they didn &apos;t have to take him on a piece .
But the way Bob presented this idea was crucial .
They donated 20 million dollars , and most of all , it was unexpected because people felt safe and protected by leadership as natural response to trust and cooperation .
And very spontaneously and unexpectedly , people were acting with each other .
Leadership is a decision , not a run .
They are rulers , and we do what they say , because the authority is given to us , but we wouldn &apos;t follow them .
I &apos;ve heard the story of some of the Marini soldiers that have gone out , and as the marine was typical , the officer was last , and he had his men eat first , and when they were done , no food was left for him .
When they were back in the field , his men took him some of their food so that he could eat , and that &apos;s what happens in those cases .
We call them leaders because they go ahead .
Because they are the first to take the risk .
They give their blood , their sweat and their tears to realize the vision of their leaders , and when you ask them , &quot; &quot; Why should you do that ?
Why would you sacrifice blood , sweat and tears for this person ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is always the same : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
Wouldn &apos;t that be an organization that we would all like to work in ?
Thank you . ( Applause )

I grew up in a small village called Motetema , on the border between Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
The water and power supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and when I was 17 , I was sunny in the winter for relaxation , with some friends .
The sun in Limpopo is very hot in the winter .
When we were sunny , my best friend next to me said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you invent something that you can just do on your skin so you don &apos;t have to wash yourself ? &quot; &quot; I sat there and I said , &quot; &quot; Hey , I would buy this . &quot; &quot; I went home and I did some terrifying statistics .
More than 2.5 billion people in the world have no adequate access to fresh water and sanitation .
450 million in Africa , five million of them in South Africa .
Different diseases are thriving in this environment , and the most threatening of these is the tragedy .
A trachom is an eye infection caused by muck in the eye , and again , infection can lead to permanent blindness .
This disease lets eight million people permanently blind every year , and the bad thing is , to avoid a trachom infection , you just have to wash your face . No drugs , no pills or syringes .
After seeing the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Even if I don &apos;t just do it for me to not have to wash myself anymore , at least to try and save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) With my left Ross , a Nokia cell phone — I had no laptop or the Internet , besides the 20 margins . ( Laughter ) Pro-stun-Internet cafe — I was talking on a bunch of flippers , and I was writing a variety of natural school .
It looked like the recipe for the secret KFC cube .
I said to myself , &quot; &quot; We have the formula .
Now we have to turn it into practice .
Four years later , after writing a 40-page business plan and my patent on the phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent owner of the country . ( &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t wash more ! &quot; &quot; ) I can &apos;t add anything . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first lotion that can replace the bathroom .
You put them on your skin , and you save your wash with it .
( Laughter ) After trying to do it in school with licensed financial resources , I went to college , met a few people , and put it in practice . The product is now ready and ready for distribution . In fact , it &apos;s already being sold for sale .
We &apos;ve pulled some lessons from commercialization and from the distribution of DryBath .
We learned that poor communities don &apos;t buy in large quantities .
It &apos;s ever after demand . Someone who lives in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a package of cigarettes , but a single cigarette every day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged DryBath in these novel packets .
You halve them and you press them out .
The great thing is , one of these sticks is replaced a bathroom for five margins .
And after we created this model , we learned a lot about the implementation of the product .
We realized that even rich suburban kids want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
We found that on average , you could save 80 million liters of water for every time these kids leave a bathroom , children on the country would save two hours every day , two hours more time for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a child .
After seeing these global impacts , we restricted to our values : cleanliness and comfort .
DryBath is a convenience for the rich and rescue for the poor .
With the product already converted into practice , we &apos;re just about to sell it to a global bank for distribution in the retail market , and I &apos;ve now got a question for the audience . On the Scottish road of Limpopo , with 50 margins per week , I &apos;ve developed a replacement for the bathroom .
What &apos;s holding you back ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet .
During that time , I learned something else . Last year , Google described me as one of the smartest , young talents in the world , and last year Google described me as one of the smartest , young talents in the world .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s most successful young entrepreneur . The first African with this drawing , and what amazes me is that I did all of this because I just didn &apos;t want to wash .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I was successful at school . You were expecting a lot of me , and I was happy to take up the student life that was made of presentations , parties and Leitkeen clever .
Within it , I was deeply unhappy , insecure and completely frightened — I was afraid of other people , before the future , before the failure and the void that I felt internally .
I just left a seminar when it started . I summed up in front of me , fumbled around my pocket , as I had done it hundreds of times when I suddenly heard a voice that was quiet , &quot; She goes out of the room . &quot;
I looked around , and no one was there , but the clarity and disagreement of the commentary was unintelligible .
&quot; It opens the door . &quot;
It was the beginning . The voice was dipped up .
And that voice lasted , for days , for weeks , continued , and she told everything I did in the third person .
&quot; She goes to a talk . &quot;
She was neutral , untouched , and , after some time , actually camerocially and calm , even though I realized that her quiet look sometimes would reveal me , and that she would occasionally reflect my own unspoken feelings .
For example , if I was angry and I had to hide it , which I used to do , because I was practiced to hide what I felt , then the voice sounded disappointed .
A subtle conversation process had begun , and the implication that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices , but I heard them , that something could not agree with me .
I spent some time telling the college doctor about it .
To be honest , I was distorting for interest and help , and I started telling him about my strange comment .
For example , I was a member of a student TV sender radiating messages on the campus , and with a terminus that was very moving very much , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Ph.D. , but I have to go .
At that point , the events started to overcome .
One reference to the hospital followed , the first of many who diagnosed schizophrenia following next , and then what was the worst , a toxic , quadrupling sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about me and my views .
But after I was encouraged to see the voice not as an experience , but as a symptom , my fear and my resistance enforced her .
This meant essentially embracing an aggressive posture against my own mind , a kind of psychological civil war , and this led , again , that the number of voices increased and became more hostile and endangered .
Do you see the glass of water ?
In practice , a vicious cycle of fear , assurance , mistrust and misunderstanding , and this was a struggle where I felt mastery and unable to build any kind of peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , the situation had dramatically deteriorated .
Now I &apos;ve had the whole insane repertoire : terrifying voices , grand visions , bizarre , harsh delusions .
If I look back to the trauma and despair of those years , it seems to me today that if someone had died then and someone else was saved .
A broken and native person started this journey , but the new person was a survivor and would finally grow up to the person I was determined to .
A lot of people hurt me in my life , and I remember all of them , but the memories get fad and weak compared to the people who helped me .
I &apos;m convinced Eleanor can overcome that .
You know , sometimes it &apos;s still in May , but the summer is still coming . &quot; &quot; 14 minutes is not enough time to call all the good and generous people who fought with me or for me and expected me when I came back from this cold , lonely place .
First of all , it &apos;s very hard to believe , and it &apos;s not just because the voices seemed so hostile and endangered , so a key step to learn how to separate the metaphorical meaning of what I had interpreted so far as a literal truth .
For example , if the voices were threatened to attack my home , I learned to interpret this as my own sense of anxiety and uncertainty in the world rather than a current , objective danger .
At first , I would have believed them .
I remember , for example , one night , holding watches in front of my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I felt was a real threat through the voices .
After the motto , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t join me .
I have a plastic bill , right ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
I came up with this knowledge , eventually , with my broken self , and every fragment was embedded with a different voice , and I slowly put my medicines back to psychiatry , just this time on the other side .
Now , I &apos;m very proud to be part of &quot; &quot; Intervoice , &quot; &quot; the organizational unit of the International Hearing Voices Movement , one of the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher inspired initiative that characterizes vocabulary as a survival strategy , a healthy response to unhealthy circumstances , not an anomal symptom of schizophrenia , which has to be experienced , but has to be explored by an experience .
This social form is not only possible , it &apos;s already evolving .
To paraphrase Chavez : When social change begins , it can &apos;t be stopped .
You can &apos;t humiliate a person who feels pride .
You can &apos;t suppress people who don &apos;t fear anymore .
In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has set up voice networks in 26 countries on five continents working together to promote dignity , solidarity and contribution to people with mental disorders to create a new language and a practice of hope that is going to carry an innocent faith in their core to the power of the individual .
As Peter Levine said , the human animal is a unique creature with the instinctive ability to heal and with the mental ability to use this innate ability .
In other words , for members of a society , there is no greater honor or a greater privilege than to enable this healing process for someone to commit , to help share the burden of suffering and maintain hope for recovery .
We are unique . We are imperative .
What we &apos;re wearing can never truly be colonized , deformed or erased .
The light never leaves .
As a wonderful doctor once told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people told you .
Tell yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

I &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
Is it photography at all ?
Because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
And yet , my interest in photography began when I received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
I combined it with my earlier preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the process was much more in planning .
And if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press it on the trigger .
So for me , photography seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time .
I believed everybody could .
So I wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trigger is pressed .
Images like this : a building site along a much traveling road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And yet , a realistic level .
Or photographs like this — dark and colorful at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
When I say reality , I mean photographic reality .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but I always want to make it look like it could have been on a photograph .
Images where you have to think for a moment to find out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about embracing an idea than really a moment .
But what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it about the details or the colors ?
Is it about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is illusion .
But ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made tangible on a two-dimensional space .
It &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I think of them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
We have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
But in a particular way , they can create something that still looks three dimensions like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
So we overload our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process in combining photographs .
It &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
So the things that make a picture look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
But when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look kind of wrong .
So I would say there are three simple rules to follow to make a realistic outcome .
As you can see , these are not three special images .
But combined , they can create something special like this .
So the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
Secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
And these two pictures perform these two requirements — shot from the same height and the same illumination .
Third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by connecting them to seamlessly .
Make it impossible to tell how the photograph was actually put together .
So by comparing color , contrast and brightness to the edges to the individual images , we add photographic males , like field deep , discrete colors and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo , although a picture can fundamentally contain hundreds of levels .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) You might think this is just a landscape , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
But this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
I personally found that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
But it requires a lot of planning .
And when I had this idea in the winter , I knew that I needed several months to plan it , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish had been taken on a glass trip .
The shore is from a different place .
The underwater part comes from a stone break .
And yes , I actually colored the house up on the island in red to make it look Swedish .
So to achieve a realistic outcome , it &apos;s from me looking out on planning .
I always start with a sketch , an idea .
And then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
And here , every piece is very well planned .
And if you take good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
So there are all the tools there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

It &apos;s this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
It &apos;s reported that WikiLeaks , your child , has published more secret documents in the last few years than the rest of the world combined .
Can that really be possible ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , can that really be possible ?
It &apos;s troubling — right ? — that the media in the world are doing such a bad job , that a small group of activists are able to release more of this kind of information than the rest of the world &apos;s press combined .
CA : How does that work ?
How can people publish documents with you ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
JA : Well , there are — as far as we know — classic Whistleblower . And we have a series of ways for them to give us information .
We only use the most modern encryption methods to chase things through the Internet so that traces are interrupted , we divert them through legal spaces like Sweden and Belgia to be able to use their legal protections .
We get information through mail , encrypted , encrypted or not , we check it out like any regular replication , we transform it — which is sometimes not so easy to do when we talk about huge database of information — publish it , and then we defend ourselves against the inevitable and political attacks .
CA : So then you &apos;re trying to make sure that the documents are legitimate , but in fact , you almost never know the identity of the source .
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s true . We &apos;re very rarely experiencing that , and if we find out at some point , we &apos;re destroying that information as quickly as possible .
( Phone notes ) This is a crap .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the CIA asks for the code for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take an example .
This is something you did a few years ago .
If we could show the document .
This was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you did and what happened ?
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s the Kroll Report .
This was an intelligence agency that was commissioned by the Kenyan government after the elections in 2004 .
In 2004 , Kenya of Daniel arap Moi was registered for more than 18 years .
He was a soft dictator in Kenya .
And when Kibaki came to the power — through a coalition of forces trying to get up with the corruption in Kenya — they put this report in commission , gave more than two million pounds out of this and another report .
And then he kept the government for himself and used it as a political printing against Moi , who was the richest man — still the richest man in Kenya .
It &apos;s the holy grail in Kenyan journalism .
I &apos;ve been there in 2007 , and we &apos;ve managed to get this in the hands just before the elections — the national elections on December 28th .
When we published the report , we did three days after the new president , Kibaki , decided to connect with the man he wanted to deal with . So Danial arap Moi , this report became a burden for President Kibaki .
CA : And — to cut the story — the report was known in Kenya , not by official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , he actually influenced the choice .
JA : Yeah . This was the front page in the Guardian , and it was then printed around Kenya in all countries , in the Tanzanian and South African press .
And so it came out of there .
And so , after a few days , the Kenyan press felt safe to report it .
And it walked 20 days later in the Kenyan television , the voting vote shifted by 10 percent , after a Kenyan secret report , which then changed the outcome of choice .
CA : Wow , then your leak has changed the world significantly ?
Yes : Jepp .
( Applause ) CA : Here — we &apos;re going to show a short clip of the Bagdad &apos;s aerial attack .
The video itself is longer . But here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — this is hefty material , I should warn it .
Funk : ... just shit once you have them , just stop .
I can see , oh , I &apos;ve got four Humvees out there , ooh ...
All right . OK . I fire .
Say modest if you have them . Let &apos;s shoot .
Put them all in Brand .
Go , fire free !
( Machine guilt ) White shooting . White shooting . ( Machine guards ) White shooting .
Hotel ... Bush master two-six , Bushmaster two-six .
Movement , immediately !
So , we just caught all eight individuals .
Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopter &#93; , and we continue to shoot .
Roger , I have them .
Two to six , here &apos;s two-six , we &apos;re mobile .
Ups , sorry . What is it about ?
Damn Kyle . All right , hahaha . Hab &apos; hit her .
CA : How were the impact of this ?
JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was substantial .
We ended up sending two people to Bagdad to study the story further .
Because this is just the first of three attacks that took place in this site .
CA : Aha , I mean , 11 people died on this attack , right and two of them worked at Reuters ?
JA : Right , two wheels of Reuters , two little kids were being wounded .
In total , between 18 and 26 people were killed .
CA : And when that was published , it caused extensive outrage .
What was the key element of this thing that actually caused this outrage , what do you think ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people see the big difference in the forces .
There are people who go down the street relaxed and then have an Apache helicopter in a kilometer away with a 30-millimeter canon on each side — looking for a reason for that — and killing people who want to save wounds .
And there were two journalists who were clearly not insurgent because that &apos;s their full-time job .
CA : And there &apos;s this U.S. intelligence agency , Bradley Manning , who was arrested , and he basically agreed in a Chat that he played this video with 280,000 secret telegrams of the U.S. Embassy together .
So , does he have ?
JA : So , we agreed to get the telegrams .
He was claimed , about five days ago , for buying 150,000 telegrams and published 50 .
Now we published a telegram in the spring of the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik , but it doesn &apos;t necessarily have to do with it .
I mean , I was a well-known visitor of this message .
CA : Well , if you had received thousands of diplomatic telegrams of the message ...
JA : Then we would have published them . ( CA : Would you have ? ) JA : Yes . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because this is the true state of things that show the interplay of Arab governments , the real human rights stories of these governments .
If you look at uncharted telegrams , you find these kinds of material there .
CA : Let &apos;s talk a little bit more general about this .
So , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it really about supporting secret information ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s the question of what information in the world matters , what kind of information can lead to reforms .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So information that comes from organizations with economic efforts , and that &apos;s a really good signal , that if that information comes to light , they may be doing something good , because the organizations that they know best , that they know very well , are the work to hide them .
And that &apos;s what we found in practice , and that &apos;s the story of journalism .
CA : But are there also risks , either for those who are affected , or even for society as a whole , where the leather actually has negative , unintended consequences ?
JA : Not that we would have seen it in what we published .
I mean , we have a policy of harm reduction .
We have a way of thinking about news that has any personal — personalized information .
But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your doctor &apos;s record ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret , but we have to do with informants that come to us with a real and good motivation .
CA : Well , they &apos;re very motivated .
And what would you say , for example , the parent of someone — whose son is serving in the U.S. military , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you published something , somebody had a good reason for it .
It shows a U.S. soldier making fun of dying people .
That makes the impression — made the impression of millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are unhuman .
But aren &apos;t they . Not my son . How can you do it ? &quot; &quot; What would you say about it ?
JA : Yeah , we hear that very often .
But remember , the people in Bagdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they experience every day .
It will change people &apos;s perception and opinion that pay for everything , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So then you &apos;ve found a way to bring light into these , as you &apos;re serious about , these dark secrets of companies and governments .
Light is good .
But isn &apos;t there irony in the fact that so that you can shine the light , you yourself , personally , have to make a secret for your sources ?
JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have WikiLeaks-Dissidents until now .
We have no sources that are dissidents against other sources .
If that happened , it would be a tricky situation for us , but we probably operate in a way that people feel morally committed to our mission and not to mess it .
CA : I would be interested , just because of what we &apos;ve heard — I &apos;m curious about the TED audience &apos;s opinion .
There are certainly some views about WikiLeaks and Julian .
You know , hero — hero of the people — that brings this important light .
Doctor Stasi peaks .
Who here has the hero vision ?
Who thinks it &apos;s a dangerous killer ?
JA : All right . There must be some .
CA : They like you , Julian , they like you .
We need to do more . Let &apos;s show another example .
That &apos;s something you haven &apos;t caught yet , but I think you &apos;re doing this for TED .
This is an amazing story that just happened recently , right ?
What is it about ?
JA : This is an example of what we do every day .
By the end of last year — in November last year — there was a series of explosions of oil sources in Albania like the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , just not that big .
And we got a report — a kind of technical analysis of what happened there — that actually meant that security people of some rivalous , competing oil companies apparently park trucks there and then chased into the air .
And part of the Albanian government was involved in it , etc . , etc .
And in the technical report , none of it was at all , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t manipulate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
So we were a little bit skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil company that wanted to play the subject up .
On this basis , we published it and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , it seems OK , but we can &apos;t test it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter just this week from the company that wrote this because they want to make the source inventive — ( Laughter ) and they say , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to find the source . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document are they talking about ?
Can they prove that they have the rights on this document ?
Is it really listening to them ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us a screenshot with the author in Microsoft Word ID .
Yes .
( Applause ) It happens quite often .
This is sort of one of our ways of identifying — understanding what material this is , we &apos;re trying to get these people to write us letters .
CA : Yeah . Do you have internal information from BP ?
JA : Yes , we have a lot , but right now we &apos;re collecting donations and regulating organizational organisms .
So our publication rate has been more minimal in the last few months , while we &apos;re reworking our systems in the background for the phenomenal public interest that we face .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any growing , newly founded organization , we &apos;re a little bit overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we get a lot of whistleblower revelations of very high killers , but we don &apos;t have enough people to actually work and check that information .
CA : So that &apos;s your main passage , basically journalist volunteers and / or funding journalist salaries ?
JA : Yeah , exactly and trustworthy people .
We &apos;re an organization that &apos;s hard to grow fast because of the kind of material that we have to do with , so we need to reconstruct so that we can get people who deal with the affairs of national security and then with less security issues .
CA : All right , let &apos;s try to understand your personally and how you got to that job .
I think you &apos;ve read that as a child , you &apos;ve gone to 37 different schools .
Can that be true ?
JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business , and then on the flight outside a sector , the combination of both ...
( Laughter ) CA : Well , a psychologist might say that this is a recipe for growing pursuit trajectory .
JA : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker in young years , and you got into the authorities early .
JA : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist activist in my youth .
I wrote a magazine , I was punished for it when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with the term hackers .
I mean , there &apos;s — there &apos;s a method that you can use for different things .
Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s used mostly by the Russian mafia to spark their grandmother the bank account .
So the award is no longer — not as nice as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to plug the bank accounts of some grandmothers , but what about your core values ?
Can you give us a sense of this and maybe call an event of your life that influenced you at home ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure of the event .
But the values at the core : Well , empowered , generous people don &apos;t create victims ; they take care of victims .
And this is something from my father and something from other energized , generous people who have given it in my life .
CA : Abrave , generous people don &apos;t create victims ; they take care of victims ?
JA : Yeah . And , you know , I &apos;m a flirty person , so I &apos;m not necessarily as strong as what this is about . But in a sense — there &apos;s another way of taking care of victims , which is to monitor perpetrators in their crimes .
And so that &apos;s one thing that &apos;s been in my character for a long time .
CA : And then I &apos;ll tell you quickly , last minute , this story : What happened in Iceland ?
You published something there , you got problems with a bank , then the intelligence agency was stopped taking the story .
Instead , they &apos;ve known your site .
This made you very prominent in Iceland , and then what happened ?
JA : Yeah , that &apos;s a great case . Well , that &apos;s great .
Iceland had this financial crisis .
It was hit by all countries in the hardest place .
Her banking sector was the 10 times the BSP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we publish this report in July last year .
And the national television was given a one-hour five minutes before they wanted to send it , like in a movie that ends up on the desk , and the news speaker said , &quot; There &apos;s never been . What do we do now ? &quot;
Well , we just show the website , all the time , as a filler , and so we got very famous in Iceland , we went to Iceland , and we talked about this thing .
And there was this sense in society that this will never happen again , and as a result , with some Icelandic politicians and other international accounts , we &apos;ve put together a new package of laws for Iceland so that it can become a kind of foreign curriculum for free press with the strongest journalist protection of the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
Iceland is a northern country , so it can , like Norway , get into the system .
And just a month ago , all of this was passed by the Icelandic parliament .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
If you think about the future , do you think it will be more a Big Brother that practices more control , more secrets , or are we watching Big Brother , or will it continue in both directions ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure where it &apos;s going to go .
I think there &apos;s enormous pressure to harmonize the laws of freedom of speech and transparency all over the world — within the European Union , between China and the United States .
Where is this going to go ? Anybody telling .
That &apos;s why today &apos;s time is very interesting , because with just a little bit of effort , we can change it in one way or another .
CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m meeting the audience nerve when I say Julian , is careful and all the power for you .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
&quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do / I &apos;m not going to dance to your war drums .
I &apos;m not going to borrow my soul or my bones of your war stroke .
I &apos;m not going to dance to that drum beat .
I know the sheep .
It &apos;s without life .
I also know the fur you &apos;re sleeping with .
It was once alive , chased , stolen , stretched .
I &apos;m not going to dance to your yielded war .
I &apos;m not going to crack for you , turn me , break .
I &apos;m not going to hate you or hate you .
I &apos;m not going to kill for you .
Most of all , I &apos;m not going to die for you .
I &apos;m not going to be trusting about the heritage or about the suicidal .
I &apos;m not going to be on your side or dance to the bombs , just because everyone &apos;s doing that .
Everybody can be wrong .
Life is a right , not a side thing or a randomness .
I &apos;m not going to forget where I came from .
I &apos;m going to build my own drum .
My loved ones around me , and our song will be like dancing .
Our hum will be like drums .
I don &apos;t want to be played .
I &apos;m not going to borrow your drums with your name or my rhythm .
I &apos;m going to dance and resist and dance and not let go and dance .
This heart attack is louder than death .
Your war drum is not louder than this breathing tube . Haaa .
What &apos;s going on , TED people ? I don &apos;t hear any of you .
( Applause ) A bunch of Pacific people .
It &apos;s by confused , aspiring Pacific .
I figured it out .
I &apos;ve had a lot of wrong lately .
Like so many .
So I couldn &apos;t decide what to read today .
I was prepared , of course .
That means I prepared my outfit — ( Laughter ) — different ways to find out who and who I am in front of .
The density does that .
She prepare you . She gives you a target .
So I &apos;m going to read you a poem that was just chosen .
But you have to sit for about 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
Now take them in your arm .
You don &apos;t need to say your name , you can just hold it up .
Do you have them ?
This poem is called &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; The whole sacred story was banned .
Unwritten books predicted the future , planted the past .
But my head reveals what seems limitless : the inventive violence of man .
Water son should be / will it be ?
What boy will one day go underground ?
The death of our boy is shaking awake .
We keep the dead in real time .
We trust women , complicated .
Boards are beaten every day .
Prophets are made . Prophets are mixed .
With war and tooth , it emailed , healthy lima childhood units .
All the colors are breaking , none of us are consistent .
Don &apos;t look for my shadow behind me . I &apos;m wearing it in me .
I live circles of light and dark .
A-rhythm is half silence .
I know now that I &apos;ve never been the one and not the other .
Disease , health , soft violence .
I think now I &apos;ve never been in .
Before the form , I was a storm , blind , namely — I still am .
Human beings were blinking , malignant .
I was never in .
A girl dies before she gets tired .
Language can &apos;t mathematical me .
I &apos;m exponentially making my experiences .
Everything is all .
A woman loses 15 , maybe 20 members of her family .
Another one loses six .
A woman loses her head .
Another one is looking in the rubble . One is feeding on waste .
One shoots in the face . One shoots her husband .
One snows .
One built a commute .
One built boundaries .
One doesn &apos;t believe any longer that love ever reaches it .
One has never believed it .
Where do refugees go ?
Birds , downloaded , put them where they don &apos;t come from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
Confronted with absence .
We trust for every single one or we don &apos;t mean anything .
My backbone is suspended .
Absolutely goes to people or from them .
Back loaded queues .
De facto landmines .
A jeweled killer .
They harvest sealed tobacco .
They harvest bombs .
They harvest babies &apos; teeth .
They harvest palms , smoke .
Recent witnesses , smoke .
Resolves , smoke .
Save , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
Breathing .
It doesn &apos;t feel what &apos;s exploded .
If so , what &apos;s not exploded .
Thank you .
( Applause )
During my time as a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world looked awkward .
The population explosion was not stopping .
A global famine was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic , caused by chemicals in the environment , should cut our lives down .
The clean rain fell to our forests .
The desert expanded a mile or two a year .
The oil was scarce . And a nuclear winter was going to give us the rest .
None of it was true . ( Laughter ) And amazingly , what happened in the course of my life was the average per capita income of an average person on the planet in computational , inflation cleans , triples .
Life expectancy has increased by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two thirds .
The per capita food production has gone up by a third .
And this is all at a time when the population has doubled .
How did we do that — whether you think it &apos;s good or bad .
How did we do that ?
How did we become the only species that gets wealthier while it gets richer ?
The biggest of the glue in this picture represents the population number , and the level of the curve is the per capita GDP .
I think in order to answer this question , you have to understand how people bring their brains together and allow their ideas to convey and reconcile , to encounter and , in fact , to start .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we evolved to first make objects like this , and then making objects like this .
Both of them are real objects .
One is a 50,000-year-old fleet of the Acheulée making it Homo erectus .
The other one is obviously a computer mouse .
Both of them have exactly the same size and shape in a fresh way .
I &apos;ve tried to figure out what the bigger object is , but it &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because both of them were designed to fit into the human hand .
Both of these are technical devices , and ultimately their similarities are not that interesting .
It just shows that both of them were designed appropriately for the human hand .
I &apos;m more interested in the differences , because the left object was made in unchanged shape for about a million years — from a year and a half million years ago to half a million years ago .
Homo erectus made the same tool for over 100,000 generations .
Of course , there were some adaptations , but at that time , tools changed slower than the skeleton .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right is outdated after five years .
Another difference is that the object on the left was made out of a single substance .
The object on the right was made from a mixture of different materials , silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
On top of that , it was created from a mixture of different ideas : the idea of plastic making , the idea of laser technology , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;ve all been put together in this technology .
And that combination , that cumulative technology , fascinates me , because I think that &apos;s the secret in it , if you want to understand what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also a collection of ideas : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
They agreed .
How does evolution create this circulation , this combination of things ?
Well , it serves sexual reproduction .
If you have two different mutations in different creatures of an asexual species , a green and a red one , one must be better than the other .
One will die out so that the other can survive .
But in sexual specifications , it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations of different blindness .
Sex allows the individual to extract from the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not limited to its own blindness .
So what does the process that has the same effect on cultural evolution like sex on biological evolution ?
I think the answer is exchange , the habit , to exchange one thing for another .
It &apos;s a unique human property .
No other animal does that .
You can teach them in the lab to practice a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s actually a recipe for other animals , but the exchange of an object against another is never going to happen .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No one has ever seen a dog who &apos;s slipping his bones in a fair way with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can cultivate a culture without exchange .
It &apos;s like an asexual culture .
Chimpanzees , killer whales , creatures of these species have a culture .
They teach each other their traditions that are passed away from the parents to the offspring .
In this case , the chimpanzees teach each other how to crack stones .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , don &apos;t gather , never combine , and the reason is that there &apos;s no sex in some sense , there &apos;s no exchange of ideas .
Chimpanzee groups have different cultures in different groups .
There is no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange increase the standard of living ?
Well , the answer to that came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you the stone-time version of his story , although his story was about trade between countries .
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three for a flake .
Oz takes an hour to make a spear and two for a flake .
So Oz is better at making spears and floods than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and floods .
But no , because you can also see it this way : if Oz makes two spears and Adam makes two flavors , and then they exchange , each one of them saved an hour of work .
And the more they do that , the more it will regret , because the more often they do it , the better Adam will be to create faustity , and the better it will be to make spears .
The winning from the exchange will only grow bigger .
And there &apos;s one of the nice sides of the exchange , which is actually giving the impulse to more specialization , which is again giving the impulse for more exchange , and so on .
Adam and Oz both spend an hour .
That &apos;s what prosperity is ; satisfying your own needs , saving time .
Ask yourself , how long would you have to work on this if you had to give yourself light for an hour to read a book tonight .
Suppose you start at the very beginning . Let &apos;s say they go out to the country .
They find a sheep . They kill it . They extract the fat from it .
They make it out . They make a candle out of it , etc . , etc .
How long would you take it ? A pretty long time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of readers if you earn as much as a British today on average ?
The answer is about half a second .
Early , in 1950 , you had to work eight seconds to earn on average what you got so much light for .
That &apos;s what you &apos;ve achieved for seven-and-a-half seconds of prosperity since 1950 , because in that seven-and-a-half seconds , you can do something else , or you can acquire a different commodity or service .
And earlier in 1880 , you &apos;d have to work 15 minutes to acquire that amount of light from a average wage .
Early , in 1800 , you &apos;d have to work six hours to buy a candle that &apos;s burning for an hour .
In other words , an average person with a average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
Think back to the picture of the front arrow and the mouse and ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who made it and for whom ? &quot; &quot; The tailbox was made by someone for themselves .
It was self-care .
Today we call poverty .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Ten ? Hundreds ? thousands ?
You know , I think it was probably millions .
Because you also have to include the man who builds the coffee that was used for the man on the oil platform , who drilled out after the oil that was made of the plastic , etc .
They all worked for me to make a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how societies work .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
In earlier days , when you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
That &apos;s what you got rich . They employed it .
Ludwig XIV. had a lot of people working for him .
They made his silly Outfits , like this one . ( Laughter ) And they made his silly hair or whatever .
He employed 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
But a recent tourist who &apos;s walking around in the palace of Versailles and looking at the images of Ludwig XIV. also employs 498 people to prepare his food at night .
They work in Bistros and Cafes and restaurants and businesses all over Paris , and they &apos;re all willing to serve you for an hour an excessive time that &apos;s probably better quality than Ludwig XIV. has ever enjoyed .
And we &apos;ve done that because we all work for each other .
We can specialize and exchange to improve our standard of life .
Well , you can also find other animals working for each other .
Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and they work for the workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , because this is all happening inside a colony .
They don &apos;t work on colonies for each other .
The reason for that is that there &apos;s a reproductive workforce .
That means they &apos;re specializing in terms of reproduction .
The queen alone is in charge .
In our species , we don &apos;t like that .
The reproduction is something that we &apos;re on to be able to do it ourselves .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave the reproduction of the queen .
( Applause ) So since then , when is this issue of combat ?
And how long does that go ? And what does that mean ?
Well , I think the probably oldest version of this is probably the sex workers &apos; work .
But there &apos;s no evidence for that .
It just looks like we created the first work of men for women and women for men .
In all the societies of hunter-gatherers today , you can see a workforce in the foraging community , in large and large , between hunting men and gathering women .
It &apos;s not always that simple , but you can distinguish between men and women &apos;s specialized roles .
And the beauty of this system is that both sides benefit from it .
The woman knows that , like here in the Hadzas — where women excavate roots and share them with men in exchange for meat — she knows that , if she wants to have access to protein , she has to excavate some roots in addition and trade for meat .
And for that , she doesn &apos;t have to go to a bearding hunting and try to kill a warning sign .
And the man knows he doesn &apos;t have to dig roots .
He just has to make sure that if he kills a warning wine , one that &apos;s big enough to share .
And so both sides are increasing through gender processing , each other &apos;s standard of living .
When did it get there ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do that .
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highest intelligent woodpecker .
Their brains were , ultimately , bigger than yours and mine today in this room .
They were frozen . They were praying their dead .
They probably had a language , because we know that , just like us , the FOXP2 gene that was discovered here in Oxford .
And it looks like they had linguistic abilities .
They were great people . I don &apos;t want to insult Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sex workers &apos; work .
There &apos;s no evidence that the women were collectors .
It looks like women were facing men as hunters .
And also , there &apos;s no evidence that there was an exchange among groups , because the objects that you find in the remains of Neanderthals , the tools that they made are all made out of materials in the region .
For example , in Kaukasus , there is a place where you find tools of the Neanderthals there .
They were all made of fires in the region .
In the same valley , there &apos;s the remains of modern humans from about the same time , from 30 years ago , and some of these objects are made from local fires , but not just that — many of them are made of Obsidian , which is from a very remote area .
And when people started rolling around objects like this , it was a clue that there was a exchange between groups .
Trade is 10 times older than agriculture .
People forget that . They think of trade as a modern phenomenon .
Extraction between groups has been happening for hundreds of thousands of years .
The earliest evidence of this occurred sometime 80 to 120 years ago in Africa where you can see that Obsidian and Jaspis and other things were retreating distance within Ethiopia .
You also find shells — as a team here in Oxford found — about 200 miles from the coast that came from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
And that suggests that people had started with exchange among groups .
And that will lead to specialization .
How do you know that the movement of distance was happening because of trade and not because of migration ?
Now , look at modern hunters and collectors like the Aborigines that built the material for stone in a place called Mount Isa , in a quarry that owned the trunk of the Kalkadoon .
They &apos;re doing trading with their neighbors against things like the bars spines of kites , and as a result , you find stone jumps in large parts of Australia .
Leaving tools to great distances back , that &apos;s a sign of trade , not for migration .
What happens when you exclude people from excerpt , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
And the answer is that technological progress isn &apos;t just slowed down , it actually does a flip .
One example of this is Tasmania .
When the sea level rise 10,000 years ago , Tasmania became an island , not only did people get a slow progress than the people on the mainland , they even drove a step back .
They gave up their ability to make tools from bones and fishing and clothing , because the population of about 4,000 people was just not enough to preserve these specialized skills that needed to keep the technology they had .
The same thing happened when people here in the room were exposed to a single island .
How many things that are in your pockets could we do after 10,000 years ?
But in fireland , it was different — similar island , similar people .
The reason for that is that fireland from South America is separated from a much lower sea highway , and over that sea level there was a trade contact over 10,000 years .
But the Tasmania were isolated .
Back to this picture . Don &apos;t just ask who made it and for whom , but who knows how it &apos;s done .
In the case of Faustity , the man who made it , he knew how to do it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
No one . No one really .
No one on this planet knows how to make a computer model .
I mean this really seriously .
The president of the computer company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know , because she doesn &apos;t know how to drill after an oil source to extract the oil that &apos;s made out of the plastic , and so on .
We all know a little bit about it , but none of us know everything .
Now , of course , I have to quote from a famous article by Leonard Read , the economist of the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , the pencil , &quot; &quot; where he described how it became a pencil made , and that even nobody knows how to do a pencil , because the people who build it together don &apos;t know how to crack grass , and you don &apos;t know how to do these things , and you don &apos;t know all these things .
In human society , through exchange and specialization , we &apos;ve created the opportunity to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
Language is not the same .
In language , we have to convey ideas so that we understand each other .
But with technology , we can actually do things beyond our ability .
We &apos;ve grown up to an extraordinary degree of the capabilities of the human mind .
And this , by the way , is one of the reasons I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , which is whether some groups have higher IQ than other groups .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
Relative to a society is how good people communicate their ideas and how good they work together , not how smart their individuals are .
So we &apos;ve created something like a collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the exchange of ideas , the encounter and council of ideas interconnected , and that &apos;s why technological progress is incremental , piece by piece .
But bad things happen too .
And in the future , if we go on like this , of course we &apos;re going to see terrible things .
There will be wars ; there will be economies ; there will be natural disasters .
Furable things will happen in this century . I &apos;m very sure .
But I &apos;m also because of the compounds that people are coming in , and the unprecedented possibility of ideas to encounter and start , and I &apos;m also sure that technology continues to continue , and therefore the standards are going to improve .
Because with the cloud , through black storage , through the world that we &apos;ve created , which is on its head , where not only the elites , but anyone can have ideas and let them meet and disengage , we certainly will accelerate the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

My name is Uldus .
I &apos;m a photographer from Russia .
I &apos;m focusing equally on meaningful messages , aesthetics , beauty , imagery , something irony and props .
Today I &apos;m talking about my project called Desperate Romantics .
But this boy has dreams and goals that he holds to be accepted , because being different is not easy , not at all in Russia .
The next picture is a metaphor .
This is Nikita , a tower in a bar in Santa Petersburg .
He often says , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t make me angry . &quot; &quot; Like Hulk in the movie , but I never saw him angry .
He hides his sensitive and romantic side , because for Russian men , Romantik is uncool , but it &apos;s cool to surround women and look like an aggressive Hulk .
( Laughter ) And for my projects , I sometimes take pictures and give them a new meaning , or I show them the temptation .
Sometimes I compare facial expressions and use word games : Irony , Iron Man , ironizing &#91; Buddhist &#93; .
( Laughter ) I talk to the props about social issues from my environment in Russia .
Interestingly , in Russia , most girls already dream of 18 or 19 of them as soon as possible to marry .
We &apos;re already learning as kids that a healthy marriage means a healthy life , so most girls do everything to make a good match .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
In Russia , I was a young boy , so I was a hopeless case .
So you see me with a Mexican wrestling mask in a breaddress very desperately in my garden .
But irony is the key again . In fact , I want to motivate girls to fight for their goals and dreams and to deal with prejudice .
Be strong . Be ironic — it helps .
Be funny and have some magic in the world .

My name is Awith .
18 months ago , I did something else at Google , and I started doing something with museums and art , and my boss , who is today , gave me green light .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
There &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal view is very simple with this slide and access .
I grew up in India .
I got a great education — I don &apos;t complain myself — but I didn &apos;t have access to many museums and these works of art .
So when I was traveling and visiting these museums , I started learning a lot .
And while I worked for Google , I tried to make this vision — to make art more accessible — to bring technology together .
We then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
I &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
So you just go to Google ArtProject.com.
You can look around in all these museums here .
There &apos;s the Uffizi , the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
I even come to one of my favorite ones , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
You get in two ways — very simple .
Click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
You go around and you amuse .
You want to orient in the museum ?
Open the map , and jump with a click .
There you are , you want to get to the end of the whole .
Go ahead . Good fun .
Stay silly .
( Applause ) Thank you , but the best one is coming .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite examples , Ernest Breugel worker .
I see this plus sign .
If the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
This is now one of the images .
These are all metadata .
Those of you who are really interested in art can click on this — but I &apos;m going to take it away now .
This is one of the images that we &apos;ve stuck with what we call Gigapixel technology .
For example , this picture has about 10 billion pixels , I think .
And a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
Now I &apos;m going to show you this .
You can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
You see something funny here .
I love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
But then you really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I realized there was something going on there .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I went close , and I noticed that these kids actually beat something .
I did some research , I spoke to some people at the Met , and I actually found that this is a game called Squail , where a guans are beaten on a stick on the birthday .
It was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
To go really close , you can go up to the cracks .
Just to give you a look , I zoom out so you can see what you get .
Here we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) But the best one comes — in a second .
Let &apos;s jump quickly to MoMA , again in New York .
Another favorite picture of me , star night , and the previous example was about finding detail .
But what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
And what only if you want to see Van Gogh created this masterpiece ?
You zoomed in . You can actually go inside .
I &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorite parts of this picture until I really am at the cracks .
This is star night , probably never seen before .
Now I &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
There are many more , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
Each of you , everyone — whether you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a great house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online — from all of these images , you can put your own collection .
Simple , you go in — and I created this , it &apos;s called the power of the zoom — you can zoom in .
This is the law , in the National Gallery .
You can verify everything with your perceptions , send your friends , and a conversation like that starts to talk about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
And I think , in closing , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things here are not from Google .
They don &apos;t even come out of the museums , I think .
I shouldn &apos;t say that .
They come from the artists .
And that was an experience in humility for me .
I mean , I hope we &apos;ll be talking to this digital medium of art , and represent it properly online .
And the biggest question I asked recently is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot; &quot; The answer to that is no .
It &apos;s meant to add the experience .
That &apos;s what it is . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a storyteller .
That &apos;s what I do in my life — tell stories , write novels , and today I want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling , and also some supernatural creatures , the decinns .
But before I get to that , please let me give you a quick glimpse into my personal story .
Now , of course , I do that with words , but also by a geometric shape , the circle , so in the course of my talk , you will see multiple circles .
I was born in Strazburg , France , as a child of Turkish parents .
Shortly after that , my parents separated , and I moved to Turkey with my mother .
From there , I was raised as a single child of a single mother .
Well , in the early 1970s , this was a little unusual in Ankara .
In our neighborhood , there were large families all over the place where the fathers were the family upper , so when I grew up , I realized my mother as a gift in a patriachist environment .
When I was growing up , I was actually able to see two different types of women .
On the one hand , there was my mother , a trained , secular , modern , Western , Turkish woman .
On the other hand , my grandmother , who also matched me , and she was much more spiritual , less educated , and certainly less rational .
This was a woman reading the future from the coffee shop , and Blei molded into mysterious forms to prevent the bad view .
Many people visited my grandmother , people with worse acne in their faces or bets on their hands .
Every time my grandmother murdered a few words in Arabic , took a red apple , and covered it with so many rose oranges like the number of goods she wanted to remove .
And then she circled those villages one after another with dark ink .
A week later , the patient used to come back to an investigation .
Now , I &apos;m aware that I shouldn &apos;t say things like this in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is that I saw from all the people who were looking for my grandmother for their skin problems , not one unhappy or terrified to go home .
I asked her how she did that . Was it the power of the prayer ?
And as an answer , she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pray is effective , but also pray about the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , besides many other things , a very valuable lesson : If you want to destroy something in this life , whether it &apos;s Akne , a makeup or the human soul , then you just have to close it with thick walls .
It &apos;s going to dry in it .
Well , we all live in a kind of social and cultural circle .
We all do that .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
But if we don &apos;t have any connection to the worlds beyond the worlds that we take for granted , we &apos;re also running danger to dry .
Our imaginations could shrink . Our hearts could be mutilated , and our humanity could be married if we divert too long within our cultural cooperation .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all these people look like us in our inner circle , that means that we are surrounded by our own reflection .
Now , another thing that women like my grandmother do in Turkey is to hang mirrors with seed or hang them on the back to the walls .
This is an ancient moral tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a person to spend too much time looking at their own image .
Ironically , &#91; the &#93; living in &#93; communities of equality is one of the greatest threats in the world today &apos;s globalized world .
And it &apos;s happening all over the place , under liberals and conservatives , agnostists and believers , the rich and the poor , the East and the West are the same .
We tend to group education based on commonalities , and then we create clicks about other groups of people .
I think it &apos;s a way to overcome these cultural ghettos , the art of storytelling .
Stories can &apos;t tear down borders , but they can beat holes into our intellectual walls .
And through these holes , we can take a look at the others , and sometimes we like what we see .
I started to invent and write stories at eight years .
One day , my mother brought home a Turkish notebook and asked me if I would like to lead a journal .
In retrospect , I think she was probably a little worried about my mental health .
At home , I told badly stories about what was good , because I told them imaginary friends who surrounded me , which wasn &apos;t so good .
I was an introverted child , and I went so far that I communicated with crayons and apologized myself in objects when I ran into them , so my mother thought it was good for me to write my everyday experiences and feelings .
What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and what I most wanted to do was write about myself .
Instead , I started writing about other people as myself and about things that never happened .
And at that time , my lifelong passion began writing fiction .
So from the beginning , fiction for me was less an autobiographical manifestation because a meaningful journey in other lives , other possibilities .
And please have a caution with me . I &apos;m going to take a circle and come back to that point .
Now another thing happened about the same time .
My mother became a diplomatic .
So I was cultivated from this little , abductive middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother into this , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turkin .
That &apos;s where I first met what I call &quot; &quot; representative foreigners . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children of all nationalities , but this diversity didn &apos;t necessarily lead to a cosmopolitical , egalitarian classrooms democracy .
Instead , it created an atmosphere where every child was not seen as a separate individual , but as a representative of something bigger .
We were like a miniaturization of the United Nations , which was funny , unless something new happened that had to do with a nation or a religion .
The child who represented this nation or religion was incessantly eradicated , laughed and suffered .
And I just know that , because during the time I went to this school , there was a millisecond coup in my home country , an ammographor of my nationality almost killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points at the Eurovision Song Contest .
( Laughter ) In these days , I was a lot of diving out of school and dreaming about driving to the lake .
I also got my first costume of cultural climate change there .
The other kids asked me about the film &quot; &quot; 12 o &apos;clock in the night — Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I hadn &apos;t seen , and they were exploring how many cigarettes I was smoking every day because they thought all the towers were chains , and they wondered what age I would probably start carrying a headscarf at .
I had to learn that these were the three main clips about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
After Spain , we went to Jordania , Germany and back to Ankara .
Everywhere I went , I felt that my imagination was the only suitcase I could take .
Stories gave me a sense of the middle , persistence and coherence , the three important things that I otherwise would have missed .
When I was in the middle of the 20th , I moved to Istanbul , to the city I love about everything .
I lived in a very vivid , diverse neighborhood where I wrote some of my novels .
I was in Istanbul when we met the earthquake in 1999 .
When I ran out of the building at three o &apos;clock in the morning , I saw something that made me stop .
There was the local food trader — a crappy old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t talk to outsiders .
He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long , black piece and a windshield that ran down her cheeks .
I watched the man with shaking hands opening a package of cigarettes and offered her , and this is the picture I see in front of me today , from the night of the earthquake — a conservative warmer and a vibrant transvestit that smoke together on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and destruction , our profane differences in air , and we all became one , although only for a few hours .
I &apos;ve always believed that stories have a similar impact .
I &apos;m not saying that fiction is the size of an earthquake , but if we read a good novel , let &apos;s leave our little , delicate apartments behind us , go out into the night alone and learn people we &apos;ve never met before and maybe even convicted .
Shortly after that , I went to study a Women &apos;s College in Boston after Michigan .
I witnessed this not so much as local change , but rather than linguistic .
I started writing fiction in English .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , not a refugee or an exilant , and I &apos;m asked why I do this , but the couch between languages allows me to reinvent myself .
I love writing on Turkish , which for me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which is very mathematical and intellectual .
So I feel connected to every language in a different way .
For me , like for millions of other people in the world today , English is a written language .
If you learn a language late like a nightforward , you live there with an enduring and continuous frustration .
As an educator , we want to say more and more , you know , make better jokes , say better things , but at the end we say less , because it made a gap between the mind and the tongue .
And that gap is very intimidating .
But if we can &apos;t get scared of it , it &apos;s also anxious .
And that &apos;s what I discovered in Boston — that frustration can be very exciting .
At that point , my grandmother , who had tracked my life with growing concern , began to join me in their daily prayers , because I was desperately going to marry so I could never let me down forever .
And because God loves her , I married .
( Laughter ) But instead of leaving me down , I moved to Arizona .
And since my husband lives in Istanbul , I began to compete between Arizona and Istanbul , two places on the surface of the Earth that could not be different .
I suspect part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritual .
Stories accompanied me , hold my property and my memories together , like an existential glue .
And as much as I love stories , I began to think recently that they lose their magic when a story is no longer seen as a story .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to think about together with you .
When my first book was published in English in America , I got an interesting message to hear a literary critic .
&quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you &apos;d written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant with it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There are so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only a Turkish character , and that &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now , the novel played on a university campus in Boston , so for me it was normal that there should be more international characters in it than Turkish characters . But I understood what my critic was .
And I also understood that I would continue to disappoint him .
He wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book , because incidentally I was one .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identification policies is affecting the way that stories are spread , read and discussed .
Many authors feel this pressure , but nonWestern authors feel it stronger .
If you &apos;re a female author from the Muslim world , like me , you would expect you to write the stories of Muslim women , preferably the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
You &apos;d expect you to write informative , tangible and typical stories and leave the experimental and avant-gardian to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in this school in Madrid is the same in the literary world today .
And writers are not seen as creative , separate individuals , but as the representatives of their culture , a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
All of us are told we had something very familiar if not ownership .
The writer and Pendler between the worlds , James Baldwin , in 1984 , gave an interview where he was asked repeatedly after his homosexuality .
When the interviewer was trying to put him in a box as a fasty writer , Baldwin stopped him and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see that ? In me , there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s not there in any other person , and nothing in me that &apos;s not in me . &quot; &quot; If the identification policy is trying to put us in boxes , our freedom of imagination is in danger .
There &apos;s this weak category called multi-cultural literature , where all the authors are thrown together outside the Western world .
I will never forget my first multicultural reader at Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one of the phillippines , a Turkish and an Indonesian — like in a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason we were brought together was not because we had a similar artistic style or literary flavor .
It was just because of our passport .
Of multicultural writers , you &apos;d expect them to tell true stories and not so sophisticated stories .
The fiction is thought to be a function .
So that not only the writers themselves , but their fictional characters become representatives of something bigger .
But I have to add quickly that this tendency to look at a story not just as a story , is not just coming out of the West .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And I experienced that in my own suffering , because in 2005 , I was introduced to court because of the words that expressed my fighter character in a novel .
I wanted to write a constructive , diverse novel that was told by an archaic and a Turkish family from a woman &apos;s point of view .
My tiny story became a huge issue , because I was pursued politely .
Some people criticized me , others bred me for writing about the Turkish archaic conflict .
But there were times , I wanted to remind both sides that it was about fiction .
It was just a story .
And if I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to clarify my work .
I want to love fiction and celebrate for what it is , not as a means for purpose .
writers have a right to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of everyday politics .
Tschechow said , &quot; &quot; The solution of a problem and the right way to ask a question is two totally different things .
And only for the last one is the responsibility for the artist . &quot; &quot; Education policy shares us . Fiction connects .
One is interested in extensive generalization .
The other thing about nuances .
One draws limits .
The other one doesn &apos;t recognize .
identification policy is built out of solid stones .
Fiction is running water .
In the Bosnian time , there were surrounding storytellers , the Meddah . They went to the coffee houses where they told a story in front of an audience , often an improvisation .
With every new person in history , the meddah changed his voice , embody that character .
Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
Stories tear up all borders . Like &quot; &quot; The stories of Nasreddin Hodscha , &quot; &quot; all over the Middle East , in North Africa , on the Balkans , and in Asia were very popular .
Today , stories still penetrate the boundaries .
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk to each other , they don &apos;t usually listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still read a novel from a Jewish author and vice versa . They feel connected to the narrator .
Literature has to take us to the other side .
If she can &apos;t get us there , it &apos;s not a good literature .
Books saved the introverted , shy child I was — that I once was .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger that you can &apos;t pick books up to the table .
When the poet and Mystian Rumi met his spiritual weggienas Shams Tabrizi , he first threw books in the water and watched the letters disappear .
The Sufi says , &quot; &quot; You know , that doesn &apos;t take you beyond yourself is much worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not the lack of knowledge . We know a lot from each other , or we think it &apos;s at least . But knowledge that doesn &apos;t take us beyond ourselves makes us elite , distanced and separates us .
There &apos;s a metaphor that I love : life like a drawing circle .
As you know , a limb of the circus remains static in one place .
As the other limb draws a wide circle , it moves constantly .
That &apos;s the same with my fiction .
Part of it is embedded in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part is traveling the world , connecting different cultures together .
So I want to see my fiction , both local and universal , both from here and from everywhere .
Now , those of you who have ever been to Istanbul have probably seen the Topkapi palace , which has been the residency for over 400 years of the osman Sultane .
In the palace , out in front of the quarters of the favorite condoms , there &apos;s a place called the Diginn convention .
It &apos;s between the buildings .
I &apos;m fascinated by this concept .
Usually we &apos;re measuring areas that are between things .
We think of them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the jungle made out of smooth fire and are a symbol of humidity .
I want to make the point that maybe this fleeting space is what writers and artists most need .
When I write fiction , I estimate moisture and vulnerability .
I don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s going to happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I could write a novel about a Muslim woman , and maybe that will be a happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , weak professor in Norway .
As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything .
Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think so I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I &apos;m free . &quot; &quot; I think that was a wonderful paradigm shift .
And yet , why are the students teaching in courses for creative writing these days as the very first thing to write about what they know ?
Maybe that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
In literature , it &apos;s not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is .
We should teach young people and ourselves to extend our hearts and write about what we feel .
We should come out of our own cultural ghetto and visit the next and again .
At the end , the stories like dancing derives will rotate , draw circles about circles .
They connect the whole humanity , despite identification policy , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I &apos;d like to end with an old Sufi poem . &quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s be friends for once ; let &apos;s make life easier ; let &apos;s be lovers and lovers ; the Earth should not be alone . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games .
We &apos;re getting more in the game worlds .
Up until now , all the World of Warcrafi players have spent 5.93 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth .
That &apos;s not necessarily bad .
We &apos;re developing towards collaborative , heritable creatures .
As a result , we build stronger social relationships .
Five million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
His work is great . He &apos;s looking at why .
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimist situation .
We need to start turning the real world into a game .
Before these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep buttons .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
That &apos;s the exciting thing .
And Herodotus was born after 18 years , so the king decided to use a final cube game .
We imagine epic victions , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
The game is 2007 .
This is a fascinating adventure that you go to .
We have a comic about it . We have &quot; &quot; level high &quot; &quot; for local understanding , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
The crew of Dirty Jobs , and I was hired to a small orbit in Colorado called Craig .
It stretches only over a few dozen square miles and lies in the Rocky Mountains .
And the real job was shepherds .
My role in the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s quite banal .
I &apos;m a teacher , and I work with the people who actually practice the professions that are coming .
And my job is to just try to stay away and give a true sense of how it is to hide in the skin of these people , a day in their life .
The finished job — hating sheep . All right .
We go to Craig and we wake up in a hotel , and the next day I realize that caste will be a central part of this work .
So , usually I don &apos;t do research at all .
But this is a sacred thing , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to do whatever we do right , and we certainly want to do a lot of respect for the animals .
So I called the Human Society , and I said , &quot; &quot; People , I &apos;m going to make some liars , can you tell me how this works ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s very easy . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , just a little bit smaller .
This one was actually wrapped around the cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain sense of familiarity .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is bound around the tail , straw .
And then another band is bound around the scrotum , straw .
The blood flow is slowly interrupted , a week later , the parts that are coming down .
&quot; top ! All right . &quot;
OK , I call the SPCA to confirm the information — confirm it .
I call PETA , just like Jux , and they don &apos;t like it , but they confirm it .
OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
So the next day I go .
And I get a horse , and we bring the liars , and we lead them to a running ball that we built , and we run livestock .
Melanie is Alberts Woman .
Albert is the sealed sheep .
Melanie takes the stem up — both hands — a hand by both legs on the right , and also on the left .
The tribe is placed on the foster , it extends it .
All right . class .
Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is there .
I always look at the process before I try .
As an apprentice , you know , there you go .
Albert reaches into his pocket , you know , this black band hevorating , but what comes to the front is a knife .
And I think that &apos;s not a rubber at all .
And he grabbed it in a way that could capture the sunlight that just fell over the Rocky Mountains , it was very — it was , it was amazing .
Within about two seconds , Albert had the knife under the cartilage of the tail , right on the sound of the noise , and very quickly the tail was gone and the bucket I was holding .
One second later , he had , with a big thumb and a severely horned line , the scrotum safely in his handle .
And he pulled it up to himself , like this , and he took the knife and he put it on the top .
Now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; You know what &apos;s coming , Michael . &apos; You don &apos;t know . OK .
He cuts them off , puts the tip over his shoulder , and then he grabs the scrotum and squeezes it up , and then his head hits down , grabs my vision , but what I hear is a smiley loud and a sound that sounds like you &apos;re pulling a tape off from a sticky wall , and I &apos;m not kidding .
Can we play the video ?
No , I &apos;m just kidding — we &apos;re not going to — ( Laughter ) I thought it &apos;s best to talk in images .
So , and then I do something I &apos;ve never done in a shot of Dirty Jobs , never .
I say , &quot; &quot; Hold . Stop . &quot; &quot; You all know the show , we use Take One , we don &apos;t take a Take Twhere .
There &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
We &apos;re not silly around , we &apos;re not sampling , we &apos;re filming what we &apos;re getting !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . That &apos;s insane . I mean , honestly .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s crazy .
We can &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; And Albert said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened here , but there are testicles in the bucket , and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; What do you get to do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him the right way .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t circulate and bleed — we &apos;re radiated to five continents , man .
We &apos;re wired twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he picks out a bag of these little rubber bands .
Melanie grabs another tribe , puts it on the paw , the band is wrapped around the tail , the band is bound around the scrotum .
The tribe falls to the ground , the tribe goes two steps , falls , goes up , freezes easily , goes a few more steps , falls .
And I think that &apos;s not a good sign for the tribe , at all .
It &apos;s up , it &apos;s walking in the corner , it &apos;s shaking , and it &apos;s going to sit down , and it &apos;s clearly suffering .
And I look at the trunk and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
When does it come back ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take to fall ? &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
The tribe that he just finished his little procedure jumps around , the blood flow stopped .
It crawls into something grass , completely left .
And I was just overwhelmed with how wrong I was in that second .
And I was reminded of how completely wrong I was , so often .
( Laughter ) And most of all , I was reminded of what an insanely short match I had pulled that day , because now I had to do what Albert had done just before , and in the case of the hall was about 100 of these worms , and all of a sudden the whole thing struck me like a German porno , and I think — Melanie lifts the sludge up , put it on the foster , it &apos;s been stretching .
Albert gives me the knife .
I go in , the tail comes off .
I go in , grab the scrotum , the top comes down .
Albert refers to me , &quot; &quot; Just push it up . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; Go ahead . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
The testicles come to the front , they look like thumbs coming out of you , and he says , &quot; &quot; Listen .
Put them off . &quot; &quot; And I understood him , I heard all his words .
( Laughter ) But how — how did I get into this situation ?
How — you know — I mean , how did I get into this situation ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the thoughts self-assemble , and suddenly I &apos;m standing in the Rocky Mountains , and the only thing I can think about is the Aristotle definition of a tragedy .
Aristotle says a tragedy is the moment when the hero is faced with face-to-face with his own identity .
( Laughter ) And I think , &quot; &quot; How do I get to this strange metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I think right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get the thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t avoid having that sight in front of me , so I did what I had to do .
I swept ahead , and I took her .
I took her like this , and I pulled my face back rusty .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my heart .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
OK , I &apos;m still involved with poetics , with Aristotle , and I think — all of a sudden , two words in my head are flouring in my head that I haven &apos;t heard before my professor of class had acknowledged me in my school .
And this is Anagnorisis and Peripeteia .
Anagnorisis and Perieteia .
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for insight .
literally the transition from ignorance to knowledge , which is Anagnorisis .
What our channel does , it &apos;s what Dirty makes jobs .
And I hide every day to the neck in Anagnorisis .
Fantastic .
The other word , Peripeteia , describes the moment in big tragedies , in which , you know , euripides and Sophokles — the moment that Audipus has his moment in which he suddenly recognizes that the hot girl he slept with , and his children , his mother is . OK .
This is periphery or periphery .
And this metaphor in my head was — I have Anagnorisis and Peripeteia on my chin .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , it &apos;s a great lesson .
Once you look for Peripeteia , you find them everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
Try the whole film to help the little child see the dead people , and then , boom — oh , I &apos;m dead — periphery .
You know ?
It &apos;s compelling when the audience sees this .
Neo in &quot; &quot; Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know .
Oh , I live in a computer program — this is weird .
These revelations that lead to sudden insights , and I &apos;ve got them over and over again , over 200 dirty jobs , I &apos;ve got them all the time , but these — this one blew me in a way that I hadn &apos;t caught .
And when I stood there looking at the happy sludge that I had just shut down — but it looked OK .
When I looked at the other poor thing , where I had done the whole thing in the correct way , it occurred to me that when I went wrong , and when I fell so often wrong , literally , what other peripheretic misconceptions could I relate to ?
Because , you know , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who is one .
And I &apos;ll address it .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested or not , but are you aware that you filmed in any state ?
You &apos;ve worked in mines , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel stations , you &apos;ve worked in any major industry .
You stood aside by side to the people that our politicians desperately want to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary in front of me , drinking with the steel workers Rye Whiskey , who &apos;s running down their child .
I mean , these are the people I work with every day .
And if you have something to say about their thoughts in their overall , it &apos;s time to think about it .
Because , you know , human , four years . You know , that &apos;s going through my head when I have the testicles on my heart , the thoughts jump around .
And Dirty Jobs didn &apos;t really change after this shoot , in terms of what the show is , but for me , it changed .
And when I talk about the show now , I &apos;m not going to tell you any longer just the story you &apos;ve heard , and 190 similar .
I &apos;m doing that , but I &apos;m also talking about some other things that I was wrong about , some other ideas about work that I thought was unacceptable and that are not .
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
As a group , they are the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start by whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label &quot; &quot; and all the other happy workers &apos; crap .
I &apos;m just going to tell you that these are brilliant people doing unthinkable work .
People who read overexperienced animals whistle in the work before , I swear to God , I did it with them .
They have this amazing symmetry in their lives .
And I see this over and over again .
So I wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these sacred freaks .
As a result of your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about this in the last 36 hours .
And as a result of your passion — what might be wrong with this ?
Whereas the worst advice I &apos;ve ever gotten .
( Laughter ) Leve your dreams and go bankrupts , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I got to hear when I grew up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but you told me , if you &apos;re passionate , everything goes in .
I can give you 30 examples from the standpoint — Bob Combs , the pig farmer from Las Vegas , who collects the food chain of the Casinos and fed them to his pigs .
Why ? Because in the things that we don &apos;t eat , there &apos;s so much protein that his pigs grow twice as fast , and he &apos;s a richer pig farmer , and he &apos;s good for the environment , and he &apos;s spending his days doing this incredible service , and he smells terrible , but God is pleasant .
He &apos;s got a great deal .
They ask him , &quot; &quot; Are you passionate about this ? &quot; &quot; And he would laugh you out .
The value of this man — he recently offered 60 million dollars for his farm , and he suggested the supply , outside Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He stepped back , and he looked at what everybody else did , and he went in the opposite direction .
And I hear this story over and over again .
Matt Froind , a New Canaan milk farmer , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized that the crap of his cows was more value than her milk , if he could use it to make biologically degradable flower heads .
Now he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
Simply passionate — this man is — I &apos;m going to ask you .
So I started looking at passion , and I started to look at efficiency versus efficiency , which Tim talked about earlier , which is a big difference .
I started looking at teamwork and determination and basically all these bonds that are called &quot; &quot; Successories , &quot; &quot; which are now related to these malignant artwork in seats around the world .
All of this — all of a sudden , everything is put on its head .
Safety — safety is coming .
To get back to OSHA and PETA and the Human Society . What if OSHA is wrong ?
I mean , this is heresy , what I &apos;m going to say now , but what if security is actually in the third place ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean , really .
What I really want to say is that my security matters to me in these crazy jobs , just like the people I work with , but the ones that really do everything , they &apos;re not out there talking about security .
You know that other things are going on — the work is about getting everything done .
And I &apos;ll never forget , on the Beringmeer , there I was on a crabbboat , with the men of Deadliest Catch , who I worked with in the first sphere as well .
We &apos;re about 100 miles away from the Kiski Russia , 50 feet high seas , huge waves , green water is erasing over the tax heel .
The most hostile environment I &apos;ve ever seen , and I was in the back with a man to tie the crab fall .
So I &apos;m 40 feet above the deck , which is sort of like looking down at the top of your own shoe , and you do that in the middle of the sea .
Incredible .
I &apos;m sticking down , I &apos;m going to tax off , and I &apos;m saying , with a certain degree of inconvenience , Captain , OSHA .
And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? — ocean . &quot; &quot; And he shows out .
( Laughter ) But the moment he said next , in the lower 48 , can &apos;t be repeated .
It can &apos;t be repeated in any factory shelf and no construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Boy , &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s actually at my age , and he calls me boy , I think that &apos;s great — he says , &quot; &quot; Boy , I &apos;m the captain of a crabbber ship .
My duty is not to get you home alive .
My duty is to let you go home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) If you want to come home alive , that &apos;s your issue .
And the rest of the day , there &apos;s security going on .
And I think — the idea is that we create this false sense of indifference when everything we talk about is the responsibility of others as if it was our own , and vice versa .
Anyway , lots of things .
I could talk forever about the many little failures that we &apos;ve imagined , and the endless list of things that I was wrong with .
But basically , I come to this conclusion .
I designed a theory , and I &apos;m going to tell you now , in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
This is what it says — we &apos;ve explained the war to work as a society , each of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , basically .
We didn &apos;t plan to bother him , and we didn &apos;t scare our mustache in Machiavellian ways , but we did .
And we &apos;ve been running this war at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we represent working people on TV , it &apos;s ridiculous .
If you see a plumber , it weighs 300 pounds , and you see its postfolds , give it up .
You see it all the time .
This is what plumbers look like , right ?
We make them heroes , or we make them the punchline .
This is what television is doing .
At Dirty Jobs , we really struggle to do that , which is why I do the work and not cheat .
But we &apos;re doing this war on Madison Avenue .
I mean , so many of the commercials that are shown there — as a message , what &apos;s really said in it ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less if you didn &apos;t have to work that hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could get a little bit more quiet if you could do something early on in freezing , that &apos;s all in it , and over and over again .
Washington — I can &apos;t start talking about the existing treatments and policies that affect the quality of the available jobs , because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know it &apos;s one of the front lines in this war .
And right here , Silicon Valley . I mean , how many people have an iPhone with it ?
How many people have Blackberries ?
We have a belief , we are connected .
I would never want to make the impression that from the technological revolution , something bad emerged .
My goodness , not to this audience .
( Laughter ) But I would point out that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
And no one celebrates imitation in the way that , according to the boys of Dirty Jobs , it needs to be done .
Your iPhone without the people who make the same skin , the same circuits , the same keyboard , over and over again .
All of that — that &apos;s what enables it to be the same as the genius that &apos;s inside .
So we have these new tools .
Our tools of today don &apos;t look like ships and chambers .
They look like the things that we &apos;re walking around with .
And the collective effect of all is the marginalization of many professions .
And I &apos;ve realized , probably too late — I don &apos;t hope , because I don &apos;t know if I can film 200 more of these things , but we &apos;re going to film as many more as we can .
And the most important thing for me is to know and really accept that I was wrong with a lot of things , not just the testicles at my child .
I was wrong with a lot of things .
So we think , with &apos; we mean &apos; I &apos; — that it &apos;s time to talk about an advertising campaign for work , physical work , skill work .
Somebody has to be out there talking about the benefits that have been suffered .
I &apos;m talking about things that our grandfathers tell us , the things that many of us probably grew up with , but we kind of — you know , sort of lost a little bit .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
Infrastructure is a huge business .
In this war against the work that I think it exists , there are victims like any other war .
Infrastructure is the first . Sinking numbers of attitudes in cellular schools are the second .
Every year , there are fewer electrists , fewer shrimp , fewer plumbers , fewer white , fewer pipeline engineers , fewer heat installers .
The jobs in the infrastructure that everybody wants to create are these people , the ones who have a severe decline .
And meanwhile , we have to spend two trillion dollars , at least , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers , just to put a wave into the infrastructure that &apos;s currently being named with an 4 minus .
So I would say , if I knew what I &apos;m not doing , just say that the jobs that we hope to produce , and the jobs that we hope to create will not be good if it &apos;s not jobs that people want .
And I know the purpose of this conference is to celebrate the things that we love and expensive to do , but I also know that clean and dirty are not oppositions .
They &apos;re two sides of the same medal , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like Peripeteia and Anagnorisis , like the poor tribe , which hopefully is no longer on the shake , and my time that &apos;s gone .
It was great to talk to you , and go back to work , OK ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very , very small idea , but it can initiate billions of big ideas that are continuously slamming into us .
And my little idea that does that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There are louder elite women in this room . There are a lot of elite women in this room .
Louder women who get too little sleep .
I myself have learned from a bitter experience of what sleep is worth .
Two and a half years ago , I fell in love with exhaustion .
I hit my head on the desk , and I broke the jog leg , and I was paralyzed on the right eye five times .
So I set out to rediscover the value of the sleeping .
Over the course of this journey , I &apos;ve been studying medical professionals and scientists , and I &apos;m here today to tell you that the path to a richer , more creative and enjoyable life is to create enough sleep .
( Applause ) We women want to be role in this new revolution in this new feminist task .
We &apos;re literally going to sleep upwards .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , sleep deprivation for men has become a sign of manhood .
Recently , I was sitting with a guy in the restaurant crying with him that he had only four hours of sleep in the night before .
And I wanted to tell him — but I didn &apos;t say it , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you had slept for five hours , our association here would surely have gotten a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a little bit of a sleeping deficit rivalence right now , especially here .
In Washington . If you want to go to the breakfast and say , &quot; &quot; What about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; you certainly get the answer : &quot; &quot; 8 a.m. is too late for me , but okay , I &apos;m going to push another round of tennis and a couple of phone conversations in between , and then you meet eight . &quot; &quot; And these people also think they &apos;re incredibly sensitive and productive , but in fact , we &apos;re not in the governance , and we &apos;re in the business .
So a high IQ guarantees for a long time .
Not a good leader , because good quality of leadership is that you see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
But we have too many icebergs that meet our Titanics .
I could even imagine that Lehman Brothers , if it were Lehman Brothers and Sisters , could still exist today .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy walking on holidays 24 hours a day , a sister might have looked at the iceberg , because she would have woke up after seven or eight hours of sleep and could have seen the big relationship .
So what we &apos;re faced with all the different crises around the world is good for us on an individual level , and what makes more joy , gratitude and success in our lives and best for our personal trajectory , that &apos;s also best for the whole world .
So I urge you to close your eyes and discover all the big ideas that are sleeping in us . Imagine your engine and discover the power of sleep !
Thank you .
( Applause )
As Chris has already launched , I study the human brain — the function and structure of the human brain .
And I want you to think about what that means .
We have this opportunity here — three pounds of opportunity you can hold in a hand — it can look at the infinite expansion of space .
It can reflect on the meaning of infinity and look at itself as it senses about the meaning of infinity .
This particular recursive property — the self-confidence — is , I think , the Holy Grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on .
Well , how do you study this mysterious organ ?
I mean , we have 100 billion neurons , little bundles of protoplasma that interact with each other , and from that , the entire spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How do we do that ?
Well , there are different ways to study the functions of the brain .
The most common approach is to look at patients with permanent damage to local brain regions where there have been genetic changes in small regions .
What &apos;s happening is not a generic decrease in mental abilities , so a kind of a decrease in cognitive ability .
The result is a very selective loss of a single function while the other functions remain , and that gives us a certain kind of security to think that this part of the brain has to be involved in the distribution of that function .
So what it does then is it takes a function on a structure to figure out what circuits are going on to produce that function .
That &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re trying to do .
Let me give you some powerful examples .
I &apos;m going to give you three examples during this talk — six minutes per hour .
The first is a very extraordinary syndrome , Capgras syndrome .
On the first slide here , you see the temporal lobe , the frontal lobes and the polar caps — the lobes that make the brain .
Under the interior of the temporal lobe — you can &apos;t see it here , unfortunately — is a small structure called the gyrus fusiform .
It &apos;s also called the brain &apos;s facial area , because after its damage , you can &apos;t see the faces of people anymore .
You can still see them through their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s Joe . &quot; &quot; But if you look at them , you don &apos;t know who they are .
You can &apos;t even see yourself in the mirror .
Of course , you know that you have to be when you &apos;re blinking and blinking your counterpart , and you know you &apos;re standing in front of a mirror , but you can &apos;t really recognize yourself .
It &apos;s known that this syndrome is caused by an accuse of the gyrus fusiform .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rarely , that very few medical professionals and not even neurologist know about it .
It &apos;s Capgras syndrome . It can be described to you that a patient who otherwise is completely normal , wake up after a head injury , looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This person looks exactly like my mother , but she &apos;s a cheaper .
She &apos;s another woman who only pretends to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How does that happen ?
This person is otherwise with clear mind and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , he grabs his delusion , and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
The most common explanation that you can find in all psychiatric textbooks is a Freudian epiphany , which says that this guy — and the same is true of women , but I &apos;m going to narrow myself to men here .
As a little baby , you have a strong sexual desire after your mother .
This is what we call the ecology complex for Freud .
I &apos;m not saying I believe in it , but that &apos;s the common Freudian view .
And when you grow up , the cortex develops and inhibits this hidden sexual propulsion against your mother .
Thank God , otherwise we would all be sexually aroused every time we see our mother .
Now , if you get a slap on your head that damage the cortex and releases your hidden sexual drive that flows on the surface , suddenly you feel and unexplained by your mother .
And you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; My God , if that &apos;s my mother , how can I be sexually aroused ?
She has to be another woman . She &apos;s a cheetah . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the only explanation that makes sense for your damaged brain .
For me , this theory has never made a lot of sense .
It &apos;s very resourceful , like all Freudian theories . ( Laughter ) But it never made sense for me because I was able to see the same delusion in a patient versus his poodle . ( Laughter )
He says , &quot; &quot; Doctor , that &apos;s not Fifi . He looks like Fifi , but it &apos;s another dog . &quot;
Now , try to apply the Freudian explanation here .
( Laughter ) You &apos;d suddenly have to talk about Latin sodomy in all people , or something like that , which would be pretty absurd , of course .
So what really happens here ?
To explain this strange disorder , we look at the structure and the functions of healthy visual perception in the brain .
Usually visual signals will receive over the eyeballs and go into the visual regions of the brain .
In fact , there are 30 areas on the back of the brain that are only dealing with vision , and after the processing , the signal goes to a small structure , the gyrus fusiform , where you perceive faces .
There are neurons that are sensitive to faces .
So you could call this the brain &apos;s facial area .
I &apos;ve been talking about this before .
So when this area is damaged , you lose the ability to see faces .
But from here , the signal goes further into a structure called Amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , this structure , the Amygdala , measures the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it prey ? Is it an enemy ? Is it a partner ?
Or is it something trivial , like a mice , a piece of chalk or — OK , maybe this isn &apos;t — or a shoe or something like that ?
It &apos;s something you can completely ignore .
So if the Amygdala is excited , and it &apos;s a really important thing , then the signals are transmitted into the autonomous nervous system .
Their heart starts to beat faster .
They start to sweat to divert the heat that you &apos;re going to generate in a moment — through muscle relaxation .
Luckily , because we can put two electrodes in your palm and measure the change of the skin resistance through the transplant .
So if you look at something , I can tell if you &apos;re excited , or whether they &apos;re aroused or not .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ll get back to .
So my theory was this . If this guy looks at an object — any object — then the signal goes into the visual regions and is processed by the gyrus fusiform , and you realize the object as a vapor plant , a table , or in this case , as your mother .
Then the signal goes to Amygdala , and from there to the autonomous nervous system .
But with this guy , the connection between the Amygdala to the limbic system — the emotional core of the brain — may have been interrupted by an accident .
So because the gyrus fusiform is still intact , he recognizes like his mother and says , &quot; &quot; Yes , she looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the connection to the emotional center is interrupted , he says , &quot; &quot; But why am I not feeling a sense of warmth when this is supposed to be my mother ? &quot; &quot; Relationally a gray .
( Laughter ) So he says , &quot; &quot; How can I explain these emotional cold ?
That can &apos;t be my mother .
This is an alien woman who pretends to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do we test that ?
We take one of you here and put it in front of a screen , measure its electrothermal activity and show it images on the screen , and I can measure how you sweat when you see an object like a table or a rain screen — of course you don &apos;t sweat .
But if I show you a picture of a lion , a tiger or a pin-up girl , you start to swim .
And believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — and we &apos;re talking about ordinary people here — start to swim .
They don &apos;t even have to be Jewish for that .
( Laughter ) So what happens when you give this patient ?
If you show this patient images on the screen and you measure its electromagnetic activity ?
Tables and chairs and rivers — nothing happens , just like normal people , but when I show him a picture of his mother , electrothermal activity stays low .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother , because the connection between visual real-world is interrupted to the emotional center .
His vision is normal because the visual regions work normal , and his emotions are normal . He laughs , he &apos;s crying and so forth , but the connection of visual perception to emotion is interrupted by which he underlies deception , his mother would be a cheetah .
This is a wonderful example of our work . You take a bizarre , seemingly unmarvelous neural psychiatric syndrome , you ask the usual Freudian standpoint , and you answer instead with a precise explanation by the known neural anatomy of the brain .
By the way , if this patient is now called by his mother from the side room , he takes off and says , &quot; &quot; Wow , Mom , how are you doing ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion about the phone .
Then she goes to visit him after an hour , and he &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
They look like my mother .
That &apos;s because there &apos;s a separate connection between the hearing center in the brain and the emotional center that was not interrupted by accident .
So this explains why he can &apos;t see his mother through the phone problematic .
But if he sees it , he thinks it &apos;s a cheaper .
So how does this complex circuit get in the brain ?
Is it nature like this , by the genes or by the way ?
We &apos;re trying to answer this question by looking at another weird syndrome — phantom limbs .
And you all know what phantom limbs are .
After the amputation of an arm or leg due to a large arm , or if you lose it / it in war , like in the Iraq War — a big problem right now — you &apos;ll continue to feel the missing arm , which is called phantom arm or phantom tape .
In fact , you can get a phantom for almost every part of your body .
Even if you don &apos;t believe it or not .
I had patients who were removed from the mother-in-law — hysterectomy — and who have a phantom mother , including phantom menstruations at the time of the month .
And a student even asked me whether these patients could also have phantom PMS .
( Laughter ) Definitely a question that requires other scientific studies .
So the next question is , what can we learn experimentally about phantom limbs ?
For example , what we &apos;ve found is that about half of the patients with phantom limbs admit that they can move the phantom body member .
It knocks his brother on the shoulder , it takes off the phone when it sounded and wines to the goodbye .
We &apos;re talking about persuasive , vivid emotions .
This patient has no delusion .
He knows that his arm is not there , and nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing , sensory experience for him .
In the other half of the patients , this is not true .
They say , &quot; &quot; Mr. Doctor , my phantom body member is paralyzed .
It &apos;s solid in a compressed convulsion , and it &apos;s painful .
If I could only move it . Maybe the pain will disappear . &quot; &quot; But how can a phantom body be paralyzed ?
It sounds like a contradiction in itself .
But what we found out , in the cardiac of the medical record , with patients with a paralyzed phantom body , the real arm was paralyzed by a peripheral nerve injury .
The nerve that was separated for the arm — it was separated , like a motorcycle accident .
So this patient actually had an arm that was painful for months or a year in a armor , and then , in a failed attempt to eliminate the pain in the arm , the surgeon has amputated the arm , and what is a phantom arm with the same pain ?
This is a serious , clinical problem .
The patients get depressed .
Some of them are driven in suicide .
So how do you treat this syndrome ?
Why do you even get a paralyzed phantom arm ?
In the study of the medical records , I found that they all had a real arm , whose nerves were separated , so that the real arm was paralyzed and was carried before amputation for months in a armor , and the pain is then transmitted to the phantom body .
Why is that happening ?
As long as the arm is intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm and says , &quot; &quot; Get away ! &quot; &quot; But it gets visual feedback , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; Get out ! No ! Get out ! No ! Get out ! No ! No ! No !
And this is hardwired in the circuit of the brain , and we call this a learned paralysis .
The brain learns because of the Hebrew learning rules that the naked command of moving the arm calls the feeling of a paralyzed arm .
Now , if you ampute the arm , this learned paralysis will be transmitted into your body image and into your phantom body .
So how do you help these patients ?
How do you reverse the learned paralysis to get it from the horrible , compressed recruiting of his phantom arm ?
Well , what would happen if you were to continue to send commands to the phantom body , but there &apos;s a visual feedback that his command is being performed ?
Maybe by doing so , you can solve the phantom pathway , the amputation in the phantom body .
How do you do that ? Well , with virtual reality .
But that costs several million dollars .
So I found a way to do that for three dollars , but don &apos;t you say that to my federal agency .
( Laughter ) You need something called a mirror box .
You take a cardboard board with a mirror in the middle where you stick the phantom body flight . My first patient was Derek .
His arm had been amputeed 10 years ago .
His arm was violently ripped off , so the nerves were separated , so the arm was paralyzed , laid in a armor for a year , and eventually was amputeed .
After that , he had a horribly painful phantom arm that he couldn &apos;t move .
It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
So he came to me , and I gave him such a mirror in a box that I call mirror box .
The patient puts his left phantom arm , which is squeezed and squeezed , on the left side of the mirror , and the healthy arm on the right , and he picks up the same compressed posture of the other arm and looks in the mirror , and what does he perceive ?
He looks like his phantom arm is resurrected , because in the mirror , he sees the reflection of his healthy arm , and it looks like his phantom arm has been replaced to new life .
&quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Shake your phantom arm — your healthy fingers , or move it as you look in the mirror . &quot; &quot; And so he gives the visual impression that his phantom arm moves .
This is embarrassing , but the amazing thing is that the patient actually says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom arm moves back and the pain that &apos;s collapsed convulsion . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came to me — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , looked in the mirror , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Look at the mirror , and he &apos;s not looking at my arm . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s not looking at my Ph.M.
He knows it &apos;s a reflection , yet he has a clear sensory experience .
Now I said , &quot; &quot; Bear your healthy and your phantom arm . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t move my phantom arm . You know . It hurts . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Then you move your healthy arm . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom arm moves again . I can &apos;t believe it !
And my pain is gone .
Then I said , &quot; &quot; Be your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closed his eyes .
&quot; Bear your healthy arm . &quot;
&quot; Oh , nothing — it &apos;s punctuated again . &quot;
&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , he moves again . &quot;
He was like a kid in the jewelry shop .
So that confirms my theory of the learned paralysis and the crucial role of visual perception , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for someone to move their phantom arm back .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But then I realized that maybe in other sorts of paralysis from neurology , like strokes or focal dystonia , there could be a learned component that could be done with a similar facility .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek . &quot; &quot; Well , he can &apos;t walk all the time with a mirror to link his pain , and I said to him , &quot; Derek , take the box home and practice it for one or two weeks . &quot;
Maybe , after some time , you can hide on the mirror , learn paralysis , move your paralyzed arm back and then free from the pain . &quot; &quot; He said , and took the box home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , he costs only two dollars . Take him . &quot; &quot; So he took him home , and after two weeks , he called me , and he said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to believe it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s gone ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I thought the mirror box was gone .
( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no . My phantom arm I had for 10 years .
He &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; And I said — I was worried and I said , &quot; &quot; My God ! &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;ve changed the body image of this man . What about human subjects , the ethics and all that ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , do you bother this ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , the last three days , I had no phantom arm , so no more phantom pain in the elbow , no amputation , no phantom pain in the underarm , all my pain has gone .
I just have the problem that I have now assembled my phantom fingers from the shoulder , and that &apos;s where your box isn &apos;t going to go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Can you perhaps rebuild it so I can put it on my forehead , and if I do , I &apos;m going to get rid of my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was a kind of magician .
Why did that happen ?
It &apos;s because the brain is confronted with an enormous sensory conflict .
It receives visual signals that the phantom body is back there .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no adequate feedback . The muscles report that there &apos;s no arm .
And your motor control commands say there &apos;s an arm , and because of this conflict , the brain says , &quot; &quot; Hell with it . There &apos;s no phantom arm , there &apos;s no arm . &quot;
It falls into a state of expansion — each signal connects .
And with the phantom arm , the pain also disappears because there is no physical pain that is freely throwing through the room .
That &apos;s the good thing about it .
This technology has already been tried on dozens of patients — from other groups in Helsinki , so it could be a precious treatment method in phantom paints , and in rehabilitation after stroke , it has already been tried .
When you have a stroke , you usually think of damaged fibers , which you can &apos;t do anything about .
But it turns out that a certain part of this paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe you can force those components with mirrors .
These techniques have already gone through clinical tests and helped many patients .
All right , now let me go to the third part of my talk , which is another strange phenomenon called synesthesia .
Synesthesia was discovered in the 19th century by Francis Galton .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
It turns out that certain people in the population who otherwise are completely normal have these following blindness , and every time they see a digit , it &apos;s colorful .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is green , nine is indigo colors .
Please remember that these people are otherwise completely normal .
Or Cis . Sometimes sound is calling out colors .
Cis is blue , fis is green , another sound may be yellow .
How does this happen ?
It &apos;s called synesthesia — Galton called it synesthesia , a mixture of the senses .
We &apos;re all separated from each other .
These people are throwing their senses through each other .
Why is that happening ?
One of the two aspects of this phenomenon is very amazing .
Synesthesia is in the family . Galton said that there is a genetic basis .
Secondly , synesthesia — and this brings me to the main issue of this talk , creativity — synesthesia is about eight times more common in artists , poets , writers and other creative people than in the general population .
Why should that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
So what is synesthesia ? What is it caused by ?
Well , there are many theories about this .
One says these people are just nuts .
It &apos;s not really scientific , so we forget it .
Another one is that it &apos;s about LSD junkies and buffers .
There may be something real about it , because it &apos;s more smooth here in San Diego Bay than it is in San Diego .
( Laughter ) All right , the third theory says — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what really happens in synesthesia .
We &apos;ve found that the regions for colors and for digits are immediately next to each other in the brain , in the gyrus fusiform .
So it comes to a formal junction between colors and digits within the brain .
So every time you see a digit , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you have synesthesia .
Now think about — how does this happen ?
Why should there be these cross-connects in some people ?
Remember I said it was in the family ?
That &apos;s the key .
And in fact , there &apos;s an anormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes these lateral connections .
It turns out that all of us at birth , all areas of the brain are interconnected .
So every region of the brain is connected to each other , and over time , these jellyfish connections are reduced — the characteristic , modular structure of the adulted brain .
So if there &apos;s a gene that &apos;s responsible for this , and if that gene mutates , then the connection between suspended brain regions remains .
And if it &apos;s between dental and color real , that leads to dental color synesthesia .
If it &apos;s between sound and color real , the Ton-color synesthesia .
So far , so good .
So what happens when this gene is working all over the brain and there &apos;s quantum connectivity everywhere ?
Consider what artists and writers and poets have in common — the ability to think in metaphors , concepts that seem to be without relationship , like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the east and Julia is the sun . &quot; &quot; Well , that doesn &apos;t mean that Julia is the sun . Does it mean that she &apos;s a glorious celebration ball ?
I mean , schizophrenics think that , but that &apos;s another issue .
Normally people would say it &apos;s warm like the Sun , it &apos;s radiating like the Sun , it &apos;s nurturing like the Sun .
They immediately made the elevators .
Now , if you think that these merits and concepts occur in different parts of the brain , that leads to a higher pitch for metaphorical thinking and creativity in synesthesia .
So the eight times higher prevalence of synesthesia among poets , artists and writers .
This is a very pioneological view of synesthesia .
One last example — do I have one minute left ?
( Applause ) All right , I &apos;m going to prove to you that you &apos;re all synesthesists , but you don &apos;t want to see it .
This is the Martian alphabet , just like our alphabet . A is A , B is B , C is C.
Other symbols for other sounds .
So here we have the marine alphabet .
One of these symbols is Kiki , the other Bouba .
What is Kiki , which is Bouba ?
Who here thinks this is Kiki and this is Bouba ? Raise your hand .
Well , there are one or two mutants .
( Laughter ) Who thinks this is Bouba and this is Kiki ? Raise your hand .
99 percent of you .
None of you is Marsians . How did you do that ?
That &apos;s because you make all the quantum connections — a synesthetic abstraction , which means you can see that the sharp clay of Ki-ki in your auditory cortex — where the hair cells are crushed — Ki-ki , the visual form — sharp edges — that sort of hacky shape .
It &apos;s very important . Because what it tells us is that our brain is a primitive — it comes to you like a stupid deception , but the photons create this shape in your eye , and the hair cells in your ear respond to the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to pull out the common denominator .
This is a primitive form of abstraction , and now we know that it &apos;s happening in the gyrus fusiform of the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , and they also lose the understanding of metaphors .
If you ask someone like this , which means , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not all the gold that goes off . &quot; &quot; And the patient will say , &quot; &quot; Well , just because it &apos;s metallic and smooth , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
You have to measure its specific density . &quot; &quot; So they didn &apos;t understand the metaphorical meaning at all .
Now this area is about eight times larger than higher primates — especially in humans — than in lower primates .
Something very interesting happens here in the gyrus angularis , because it &apos;s the connection between hearing and seeing and chairs , and in humans it &apos;s particularly coined — something very interesting happens here .
I believe that it &apos;s the basis of many people who are disabled , like abstraction , metaphorical thinking and creativity .
All of these questions that philosophers have asked for millennia , we can start to study scientists through brain imaging and analysis of patients and the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
So 14 years ago , I first came across this unusual material , fishing law , which has been used in the same way for centuries .
Today I &apos;m using it to create permanent , self-assembling , rich forms , the size of real buildings in cities around the world .
I wasn &apos;t the person you would expect .
I &apos;ve never studied imaging , engineering , or architecture .
In fact , after college , I went to seven art schools , and I was rejected by all seven .
So I went on to become an artist &apos;s own fist , and I painted for 10 years until I got a Fulbright for India .
With the promise of exhibitions , I sent my pictures and got to Mahabalipuram .
The Termin for the exhibition — my paintings didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculptures .
So I tried bronze goat .
But making big shapes was too difficult and too expensive .
I went for a walk on the beach , and I observed the fishermen who put their nets on the sand .
Every day I &apos;d seen this , but this time I saw it with other eyes — a new way of making sculptures , a way to make volumetric forms without heavy , solid materials .
My first satisfying sculpture was created in collaboration with these fishermen .
It &apos;s a self-portrait called &quot; &quot; broad hip . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hung them to photograph masts .
I discovered that their soft surface of every windmill revealed constantly changing patterns .
I was hypnotized .
I went on to study crafts and to collaborate with artists , next with pockets .
I liked the fine detail that it gave to my work , but I wanted to make it bigger — from an object you look at , to something by losing yourself .
Back in India to work with these fishermen , we made a network of one and a half million hand-cracked nodes — that was launched just in Madrid .
Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the city planner of Manual Sola morality that redesigned the UV prevalence in Porto , Portugal .
He asked me if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that , and I could preserve my art .
Responsible , constructed , permanent — these are oppositions too selective , graceful and forbidden .
For two years , I was looking for a fiber that could resist UV rays , salute air , pollution , and at the same time would remain soft enough to move in the wind .
We needed something to keep the web up there in the middle of the cycle .
So we raised this 20 tons of steel ring .
We had to make him so that he could move in a normal crisis and get over Hurricane .
But there was no manufacturing software to model something vital and moving .
I found a brilliant aerospace engineer in the sail designed for the Rennjachs of America &apos;s Cups called Peter Heppel .
He helped me tackle this double challenge : precise shape and soft movement .
I couldn &apos;t build it in my well-known way , because hand-cracked nodes can &apos;t resist Hurricanans .
So I crawled a relationship with an industrial fishing factory , learned the size of their machines , and compiled a method to make spikes .
There was no language to translate this old , voluntary action into something that machines could make .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we hated the 4600 m2 species network .
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now made , permanent and lost nothing through translation .
( Applause ) This intersection was boring and anonymous .
Now she had the character of a place .
I first got under it .
When I watched the choreography of the wind unfolded , I felt protected and also connected to the endless sky .
My life wouldn &apos;t be the same .
I want to create these sculptures in urban spaces all over the world .
I &apos;m going to talk about two directions that are new in my work .
The memorable city hall in Philadelphia : I felt that this place needed a fabric for the sculpture that was easier than the retina .
So we experimented with little atomized water particles to create a dry fog shaped by wind , and the test turned out that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it and move through it without being nap .
I use this formal material to record the pathways of the subway on the surface in real time — like a view of the sound that the urban circulatory systems reveal .
The next challenge that American biennial in Denver asked if I could represent the 35 nations of Western hemisphere and their connectedness with each other in a sculpture .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to start , but I said yes .
I read about the last earthquake in Chile and the tsunamis that spread across the Pacific Ocean .
It disappeared the tectonic plates of the Earth , accelerated the rotation and literally scattered the length of the day .
So I contacted NOAA and asked if they were going to give their data out of the tsunamis and translated it into this form .
The title : &quot; &quot; 1,26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of Microsoft explorers to get shorter from the ground floor .
I couldn &apos;t build it with a steel ring , as I knew it .
His shape was now too complex .
So I plant the metal interior with a soft , fine tissue of fibers that were 15 times stronger than steel .
The sculpture could now be completely soft , so it became so light that it could be attached to existing buildings — and literally became part of the tissue of the city .
There was no software that could create these complex reforms and develop under consideration of gravity .
So we had to create one .
Then I got a phone call from New York City asking if I could fit these concepts for Time Square or the highline .
This new method for soft structures allows me to develop and build and build these scupltures in the size of skyscrapers .
They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I &apos;m now going to take them to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
So 14 years ago , I was looking for beauty in the traditional things , in manual forms .
Now I &apos;m going to combine them with high-tech materials and engineering in order to create puppy , self-assembling forms in building size .
My artistic horizon expands continuously .
Let me close with this story .
I got a phone call from a friend from Phoenix .
A lawyer in an office that has never been interested in art , never visited the local museum , dragged when possible , every flag out of the building and brought her to lay under the sculpture .
They were in their business trains in the grass , watching the shifting patterns of the winds next to people they didn &apos;t know , and shared the rediscover of the wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Look at the horizontal axis after their age .
After puberty , we &apos;re at the minimum .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
But how did we do that ?
Let &apos;s look at the four fish we eat today .
A shell can filter more than 100 liters of water every day .
( Applause )
Create a woman . If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain .
It &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from each other , and I brought a real human brain for you .
Indeed . ( Applause ) Our right hemisphere is all about this .
And at the same time , all of our sensory systems come in and explode into this enormous collage of what the present moment looks like , what this present moment smells and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like , and I &apos;m an energetic creature that looks like with the energy around me .
by the awareness of my right hemisphere , we are energetic beings who are human family .
My left hemisphere — our left hemisphere — is a very different place .
Our left hemisphere is linear and methodological .
In our left hemisphere .
It &apos;s the digestive brain plank that &apos;s me and mine .
And I asked myself , &quot; &quot; What are you missing ?
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , my brain plank became .
All relationships with the outside world .
