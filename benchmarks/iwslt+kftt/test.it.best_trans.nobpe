By the end of this year , there will be about a billion people on this planet who are actively using social networks .
The thing they all have in common is that someday they will die .
Of course , it might be considered a very soft thought , but I think it has profound implications worth exploring .
What first made me think about this is a post published at the beginning of this year by Derek K. Miller , a science and technological journalist who died of cancer .
And what Miller did was he wrote a post to his family and his friends that came out shortly after he died .
This is what he wrote when he started this thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; There you go . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post on my blog .
In advance , I asked that once my body had liberated from the penis of cancer , my family and friends would post this message that I wrote — the first part of the transformation process from an active site to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , as a journalist , Miller archives could have been written better and treated more carefully than most of the others , the fact is that we &apos;re all creating a completely different kind of archive .
Just think about some statistics .
Today , they &apos;re uploaded to YouTube 48 hours of video per minute .
200 million Tweet posts a day .
And the average user on Facebook generates 90 content a month .
If you think about your parents or grandparents , as far as they could have done , they &apos;ll have taken some pictures or some videos , or a diary lying in a box somewhere .
But today we are creating this incredibly rich digital archive that will live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think this will create incredibly fascinating opportunities for technologists .
To be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technology expert , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is create an image of what the present and the future will look like .
We already see some services that are designed to make us decide what our online profile will be and our utility on social networks after our death .
One of them , and it might not be appropriate anymore , found me when I was entering Foursquare in a refined restaurant in New York .
( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Good morning .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : death can take you away everywhere , at any time , even to the biological ward .
AO : Who talks ?
Death : go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : From brivids , right ?
So this service , very simply , makes you create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death .
Another new service is called 1,000 Memories .
And that allows you to create an online toll to the people you love , full of photos and videos and stories that can post after your death .
But the next one is far more interesting .
Probably many of you have heard of Deb Roy who , last month of March , demonstrated that he was able to analyze over 90,000 hours of video .
I think , with the capabilities of machines to understand human language and process huge amounts of data all the time , it &apos;s going to be possible to analyze a whole life of content — of Tweet , of photographs , of videos , of blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in enormous amounts .
And I think as this happens , it will become possible for our digital personalities to continue interacting with the real world a long time after our home because of the enormous amount of content that we &apos;re creating and the capacity of technology to make sense of everything .
We &apos;re already beginning to see some experiments .
A service called My Next Tweet , analyzing the chronology of your Twitter , everything you published on Twitter , to make predictions about what you might say later .
Right now , as you can see , the results can be quite comical .
You can imagine what a thing like this might look like in five , 10 or 20 years with improving our technical skills .
As we move forward , the average lab at MIT is working on robots that can interact like humans .
What if these robots could interact on the basis of the unique characteristics of a specific person based on hundreds or thousands of content that that person produced during their lifetime ?
And finally , go back to that famous scene of the 2008 election marathon in the United States , when CNN projected a living ologram of the hip hop will.i.am artist in the study to do an interview with Anderson Cooper .
And if we were able to use that same kind of technology to project a representation of our loved ones in our living rooms — interacting as if they were alive based on all the content they created while they were alive .
I think it will be absolutely possible because the amount of data that we use and the capacity of technology to understand it is both expanding exponentially .
To close , I think we should all think if we want all of these things to be transformed — if that &apos;s what it means in the definition of life and everything that comes next .
Thank you very much .

The people who come back to work after they interrupted their career , I call them Relauncher .
They &apos;re people who took a break to take care of older people , their children , focused on interest or some health issues .
Going back to work after a certain break is hard because of the disconnect between employers and these relauncher .
Workers see the hiring of people with an interval in their TV as a high-risk proposal , and these people can have doubts about their ability to start working , especially if they &apos;ve been absent for a long time .
This disconnect is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Now , successful relauncher is found .
This is Sami Kafala .
A nuclear physicist who works in the U.K. , who took a five-year break to feed his five children .
Singapore &apos;s press has written that nurses come back to work after long periods of pause .
And by the way of long working breaks , this is Mimi Kahn .
Social Assistant in Orange County , California fornian , who came back to work for a social services organization after 25 years of pause .
This is the longest break I know .
Sandra Day O &apos;Connor , Justice of Supreme Court , took a five-year pause in the career .
Instead , Tracy Shapiro took 13 of them .
Tracy was called for a poll from Today Show based on people who came back to work that they had difficulty .
Tracy wrote that he had five children and he loved the time he spent in his house , but after he spent a divorce , he needed to work , and he really wanted to bring back work in his life because he loved working .
Tracy was doing what many of us do when we think we &apos;ve done a great job research .
She was looking for a job that was accountable , and she spent the last nine months researching online companies carefully and asking for jobs , without any outcome .
I met Tracy in June 2011 when Today Show asked me if I could work with her to help her change things .
The first thing I said in Tracy was to get out of the house .
And to publicly declare that he was looking for work and telling everyone who knew he was going to go back to work .
I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to have a lot of comparisons without any outcome .
It &apos;s normal , don &apos;t discourage you .
It &apos;s going to be a few people who will take you to a working opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what happened in Tracy in a while , but before I tell you about a discovery I made when I went back to work after a 11-year break .
The idea that people do with you is like frozen .
That is , when you start to relate to you by connecting yourself with people of the past , people you worked with or went to school , they will remember you as you were before your work break .
And that &apos;s how even though your self-esteem has declined , as it happens to many of us when we &apos;re far away from our professional identities .
So , for example , you can think about being there .
This is me , a crazy woman after driving a minivan for 24h .
Or , here I am in the kitchen .
But those people in the past don &apos;t know anything about this .
They just remind you of what you were and it &apos;s a great drive for self-esteem to connect with these people and see them excited because you want to go back .
There &apos;s another thing that I strongly remember about this pause .
And that is that I was hardly following the news of economics .
My education is financial , and I rarely had news like this while I was home dancing for my four kids .
So I was afraid to be an interview and talk about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
I subscribed to the Wall Street Journal and I read it for six months , page after page , before I suffered from being able to understand what was going on in the finance world .
I think relauncher is a resource in the professional world , and that &apos;s why .
Think about our life : those of us who took a break to feed our children , take little or no maternity leave .
We &apos;ve been there before .
We move less for conjugal reasons .
We have a more regular life .
We have a great working experience .
We have a more mature perspective .
We don &apos;t want to be on the dator .
More importantly , we have an energy and an enthusiasm to go back to work just because we &apos;ve been away for a very long time .
On the other hand , when I talk to employers , two things worry about hiring relauncher .
First of all , employers fear that these employees don &apos;t have the information knowledge .
I can tell you , having been technologically backward , it &apos;s just a temporary condition .
I had done my financing analysis , a long time before I was using Lotus 1-2-3 .
I don &apos;t know if anybody remembers it , but I had to relearn them on Excel .
And it wasn &apos;t that hard . Many commands are the same .
I found PowerPoint much harder , but now I use it all the time .
I tell the speauncher , the dictators expect basic information knowledge .
And if they don &apos;t step up with time , it &apos;s their responsibility to match up .
And they do .
The other concern about employers is that the relauncher doesn &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell them they have to work hard to understand whether their interests and their skills have changed or not during the working break .
It &apos;s not the job dator .
It &apos;s the relauncher who has to prove to the employer where it can be more useful .
Back in 2010 , I noticed something .
Since 2008 , I follow programs to go back to work and in 2010 , I &apos;ve seen that there are short-term job opportunities , whether they &apos;re called shooters or not , but they &apos;re like a tyranny , like a way for professionals to come back to work .
I saw that Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee set up stage for reintroduction in the company .
I saw an engineer coming back , an outlier , asking for a request in the army , and then getting a full-time job .
I saw two universities inserting little shoots into the academic halfway through the career .
So I wrote a report about what I saw , and it became an article for the Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; The Foreign Season . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editor for the title , and also for the graphics where you can see a 40-year season among many college seasons .
And then , thanks to Fox Business News , they called this concept &quot; &quot; The 50-year-old season . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Five of the largest financial institutions have stage for professional rehabilitation .
Hundreds of people have joined you .
These stage are paid , and those who go through fixed jobs are well paid .
Today , seven of the largest engineering companies are running stage programs for engineers as part of an initiative with the Women &apos;s Engineers Society .
Why are companies using these backpacks ?
Because the stage allows the employer to consider hiring based on real work evidence rather than being placed here , and it doesn &apos;t have to decide definitively until the end of the stage .
This period of evidence delimates the perception of risk that some managers connect to the hiring of relauncher and are attracting excellent candidates that are then good workers .
Think about how far we got .
Before that , many employers were not interested in hiring relauncher .
Now , not only are they creating specific programs for relauncher , but you can &apos;t even run for yourself if you don &apos;t have a vacuum in your CV .
This is the sign of a real change , of a real shift , because if we can solve this problem for relauncher , we can solve it for other employees as well .
An employee just told me that the veteran rehabilitation program is based on this kind of typography .
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retirement stage .
Several groups , same concept .
Let me tell you what happened to Tracy Shapiro .
She had to tell anybody she wanted to go back to work .
A chat with another parent in his neighborhood brought her to a labor supply , as a matter in the financial sector .
But it was determined at the time .
They told her that it was possible to turn into something more , but without guarantees .
It happened in the fall of 2011 .
Tracy loved this company and his colleagues , and the office was 10 minutes away from his home .
Even though she had received another offer from another company , at a time undetermined , she decided to continue this stage , hoping for the best .
Something amazing happened , not only did they give them a full-time contract at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and more inspiring because they knew Tracy could do it .
In 2015 , Tracy was promoted .
The company paid her a Master at night .
She also hired another relauncher .
Tracy &apos;s initial work was a trial , just like a tyranny , and it ended up with a victory , both for Tracy and for his dictator .
My goal is to introduce this kind of internship to a lot of employers .
But meanwhile , if you &apos;re going to go back to work , don &apos;t hesitate to ask a stage or something like a employer who has no official replacement program .
Be their first successful story , and you can be the example for the next relauncher .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to talk to you today about some unexpected discoveries .
I work in the industira of solar technology .
And my new company wants to push itself in direction of environmental respect by paying attention to ...
Be aware of crowdsourcing .
It &apos;s a short video of what we do .
Oh . Just a moment .
It takes a moment to upload it .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll do — we can jump — I &apos;ll change the movie then ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
Oh , my time &apos;s up ?
Okay . Thank you very much .

It was an afternoon in autumn 2005 .
I was working at ACLU as a scientific consultant in the organization .
I went to find my colleague Chris Hansen in his office .
I explained to Chris that I felt a little stuck .
I had investigated a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — very interesting .
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and biobese , and ...
So what does that mean ?
It means that then you don &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or she to look at him , let &apos;s say , to see if he has mutations , without permission of the patent title .
The company that got a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose syndrome .
But then they went to bankrupt and they never offered it .
Breins on genes were clearly a problem and they damaged patients .
But was there a way that we could change them ?
Not then patent natural products — air , water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t patent nature &apos;s laws — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
These things remain fundamental , and they have to remain free to everyone and reserved only to anyone .
Why ?
To conclude , the courts wouldn &apos;t be willing to revocate these patents .
So we &apos;ve been busy building our case .
The patents tend to be : Ditta A causes Ditta B to treat a very dark and technical story .
Myriad received patents on two genes , BRCA1 genes and BRCA2 .
He did a lot of labs that were offering BRCA tests to stop .
They asked a lot of money for their test — more than 3,000 dollars .
It was estimated that during this period , for many years , many as 12 percent of women under trial received a wrong result — a negative result that had to be positive .
This is Kathleen Maxian .
Kathleen Eileen &apos;s sister developed breast cancer at 40 years old and was tested by Myriad .
The test was bad .
The family was raised .
But after two years , Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer .
Turns out Kathleen &apos;s sister was among 12 percent who received the false negative result .
If Eileen had received the right result , Kathleen would have been able to examine , and her ovarian cancer could have prevented .
One of the biggest difficulties we had prepared this case was to understand the best way to communicate science .
So to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and what isolated BRCA genes were natural products , we had to explain some basic ideas , like , what is a genus ? What is DNA ?
How is DNA isolated and why is that not an invention ?
And eventually we depended a lot on using metaphors , like gold .
So by isolating DNA — it &apos;s like taking gold out of a mountain or taking it off a stream .
You might be able to patent mineral activity , but you can &apos;t patent gold itself .
He probably wanted a lot of work and difficulty digging gold from the mountain , but he didn &apos;t patent it , and still gold .
And the gold , once it &apos;s exported , can clearly be used for so many things that you couldn &apos;t be used in the mountain ; for example you can do jewelry — you can &apos;t patent , it &apos;s still gold .
So in 2009 , we &apos;re ready to present our case .
We presented it in the federal court in southern New York , and the case was randomly delivered to Judge Robert Sweet .
In March 2010 , Judge Sweet presented his parent — 152 pages — and a complete victory .
By reading the wall , we couldn &apos;t overcome the eloquence that he described the science of the case .
I mean , our instructions — they were okay , but not so good .
How did it develop a profound understanding of the question in short time ?
We couldn &apos;t figure out what happened .
He wasn &apos;t just a scientist — he had a Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What a good luck !
And this is where things got interesting .
First , at a crucial moment in the case , the American government changed their mind . So in the district court .
So even with this incredible development , we were expecting to lose .
And we lost .
More or less .
It ended up making a divided decision , two to one .
Myriad didn &apos;t even talk about it , so he jumped suddenly .
Usually these questions are formed in a super-long paragraph , like a whole page with many , many phrases , &quot; in what way here &quot; and &quot; so here we go . &quot;
We &apos;ve delivered perhaps the shortest question ever presented .
Four words : Are human beings patented ?
When Chris asked me what I thought about these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I want judges to have the same reaction that I had when you brought me this question seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
The Supreme Court only listens about one percent of the cases he receives , and he agreed to give hearing to our own .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
The topic itself was fascinating .
The second quote is at the top .
Sadly , the answer is yes .
Then you can make predictions and test them .
What do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole thing is literally more than the sum of its parts .
Where are economic networks ?
What we &apos;ve looked at in detail is property networks .
And we also assign value to the company .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we have 43,000 of them .
I &apos;ll explain that to you with an analogy .
Hi . I &apos;m going to show you eight of my projects done in collaboration with the Danish artist Soren Pors .
We call ourselves Pors &amp; Rao , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Phone Zio . &quot; &quot; It was inspired by the particular habit of my uncle to ask me to do things for him all the time , almost like I was an extension of his body — turn on the lights , bring him a glass of water or a cigarette package .
As I got older , it got worse and worse , and I started to interpret it as a form of control .
But , of course , I could never say anything because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
The situation that bothered me and disconcerted me more was the use of the phone .
He kept the phone next to his ear waiting for me to make a number for him .
So as an answer and a gift for my uncle , I created &quot; &quot; The Phone Zio . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it takes two people to use it .
That &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone designed for a person .
But it was a problem when I left my home to go to college , they started eating my orders .
So I made a sleeping machine through which he could give orders to his grandchildren around the world through email .
What he had to do was take a piece of paper , put it in the cart , type in his email and order and then pull out the paper .
That device would automatically send the letter to the recipient as an email .
Here you can see that we integrated a lot of electronics that could understand all the mechanical functions and convert them into digital .
So my uncle only has to do with a mechanical interface .
Of course the object had to be very big and have a sense of ritualism , as I like my uncle .
The next piece is a sensitive soundtrack installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pigmei . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the idea of being surrounded by a very shy , sensitive , sweet creature tribe .
It works like this : we have these panels hanging on the wall , and behind we have these little creatures hiding .
And as soon as there is silence , they crawl out .
If there &apos;s even more silence , the neck is extended .
And at the minimum noise they hide again .
We had these panels on three walls in a room .
And over 500 of these little dishes are hidden behind them .
Here &apos;s how it works .
This is a prototype of video .
When there &apos;s silence , they come out of behind the panels .
They feel what humans do or real creatures do .
And after a while they become immune to the sounds that scare them .
And they don &apos;t respond to the sounds of the background .
Now you &apos;ll hear a train , and they don &apos;t react .
( Sound ) But they react to sounds in the foreground . You &apos;re going to hear it now .
( Whistling ) We &apos;ve been working a lot to make them as realistic as possible .
Every pigmeal has its own behavior , a mind , a mood stale , personality and so on .
This is an initial prototype .
And of course , it was very improved .
They were designed to respond to people , but we realized that people were very infant and playful with them .
This is the video installation &quot; &quot; The Scomparsa Person . &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued by playing with the idea of invisibility .
How can we feel an invisibility feeling ?
We work with a company that &apos;s specialized in video awakening , and we asked them to develop software for us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow them and replace a person with the background , making it invisible .
Now I &apos;m going to show you a first prototype .
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren who is physically in this space .
And on the left you &apos;ll see the elaborate video where the camera made it invisible .
It enters the room . Pop ! It becomes invisible .
You can see the camera echoes it as it follows its path .
It &apos;s a preliminary video , where overlapping hasn &apos;t been processed yet , but it &apos;s been perfected shortly after .
What we did was we put a camera in a room and a screen on every wall .
And when people walked into the room , they would see on the screen , but with a difference : a person remained invisible everywhere he was moving into the room .
This piece was called &quot; &quot; The shadow of the Sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , a papercutting of an infant drawing of an oil machine or a sun .
In front of it , this object seemed very strong and robust , while it was profile , it seemed pretty weak .
So people would walk around the room almost without noticing it , thinking it was a crap left around .
But as soon as someone passed , they started to come up with the wall uncertain way .
He got tired and crashed every time .
( Laughter ) This piece is a caricature of a man on his head down .
His head was so heavy , filled with heavy thoughts , that fell inside his hat and his body grew almost like a plant .
What it does is it moves like a drunken head down with an unpredictable , extremely slow motion .
And it &apos;s a little limited by that circle .
Because if it wasn &apos;t there , and the floor was perfectly uniform , it would start wandering into the vacuum .
And there are no wires .
I &apos;m just going to show you one example — when somebody enters the room , the object is active .
And very slowly , within a few minutes , it raises painful and then it earns ground and it feels like it &apos;s going to fall .
This is a decisive moment because we wanted to instillate the viewer the instinct of wanting to go and help , save the object .
But he doesn &apos;t really need it , because , again , he can recover himself .
This work was a real technical challenge for us . We worked hard , as in many of our work , over the years , to get the right mechanism , balance and dynamic .
It was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we did it so that it could fall , it would break down , and if it didn &apos;t bend enough , it didn &apos;t create that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
I &apos;m going to show you a very short video where we make a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
This is my colleague who lets him go .
Now it gets nervous and it &apos;s going to get it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to do it because he can lift himself .
This is a piece that we found very intriguing , and we worked with the aesthetics of the film where we put thousands of little fiber optics measures that shine like a stelled sky .
It &apos;s all done on the scale of the night sky .
We wrapped it around this massive , shaped like a teddy bear hanging off the ceiling .
The idea was to create a contrast between something very cold , distant and abstract like the universe , with the familiar shape of a teddy bear that is very comforting and intimate .
The idea was that at some point you started to see it not in the form of a teddy bear but to perceive it almost like a hole in space , as if you looked at a sparkling sky .
This is the last work that &apos;s still working on called &quot; &quot; Spazio River . &quot; &quot; Imagine a little cube about this size sits in front of you in the middle of the room , which as you approach it , tries to intimidate you , doubling its height and quadrupling its volume .
This object expands and contracts over and over again by creating a dynamic with the people moving around it — almost as if they tried to hide a secret inside or something .
We work with a lot of technology , but the truth is we don &apos;t love it because it creates a lot of problems in our work .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us express the emotions and the role models of these creatures that we design .
And once a creature comes to mind , it &apos;s as if the process of creation is to figure out how the creature wants to exist , what shape it wants to have and how it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m here .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , otherwise it would be a little weird .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And with &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
But here .
I mean the Earth .
Is Earth special ?
To understand if there are planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that are suitable for life , the first step is to understand what life needs here .
Turns out , 8.7 million species , life needs three things .
On the one hand , life on Earth needs energy .
There are different sources of energy available on all the planets .
On the other hand , life needs food , nutrition .
A challenging request , especially if we want a tomato sucker .
( Laughter ) However , all life on Earth extracts nutrients from six chemicals , which are found on every planetary body in our solar system .
It makes that thing in the middle the most difficult thing to achieve .
Not the algae , but the water .
( Laughter ) Even though the octopus wouldn &apos;t be bad . ( Laughter )
And not ice , not water in the gassy state , but in the liquid state .
This takes life to survive , all life .
And many bodies in the solar system don &apos;t have liquid water , so we &apos;re not looking for it there .
There are very few bodies to think about .
So let &apos;s try to simplify it .
We just think about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
We need an atmosphere because water is liquid .
We need to be very careful about that atmosphere .
It can &apos;t be too hot , it can &apos;t be too dense or too hot , otherwise you end up like Venus : too hot , and there &apos;s no water in the liquid state .
But if the atmosphere is not enough , it &apos;s too thin and too cold , it ends up like Mars : too cold .
Number one : If Mom Orso &apos;s bowl is too cold when Golden Rollers enter the room , does it mean it &apos;s always been too cold ?
Or could it be perfect at another time ?
The same is true of planets .
Nothing is static . They change .
They vary . They evolve .
And the atmosphere does the same .
Let me give you an example .
This is one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
This can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
It changed from a state that we would call habitable , because the three requirements for life were long ago .
Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid on the surface ?
One idea is that it escaped to space .
This is happening in all bodies with atmosphere .
It &apos;s just a matter of scale and scale .
We &apos;d like to understand how much time has escaped so we can explain this transition .
The atmosphere from where does energy take to escape ?
The particles , how do they get energy to free themselves ?
First , sunlight .
Yes , I &apos;m dancing , but — ( Laughter ) Or my God , not even my marriage . ( Laughter )
They take enough energy to escape and get rid of the gravity of the planet , just warming up .
A second way to get energy is from solar wind .
It &apos;s something I &apos;m interested in , because it &apos;s connected to habitability .
I mentioned two things about the story of the Golden Reconcile that I wanted to draw attention to and remember , and the second one is a little bit more subtle .
If the bowl of Dad Orso is too hot , and Mom Orso &apos;s bowl is too cold , the Chursect &apos;s bowl shouldn &apos;t be even colder if we follow the trend ?
This thing that you &apos;ve accepted all your life , if you think about it better , may not be that simple .
Of course , the distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
It has to play a role in habitability .
But maybe there are other things we should think about .
Maybe it &apos;s the same ones that help define the end of the story , what &apos;s good .
Earth has one ; Venus and Mars don &apos;t have one .
magnetic fields are generated by the depths of the planet by a fluid fluid conductor of electricity creating this big magnetic field around the Earth .
If you have a compass , you know where the north is .
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars , compliments , you &apos;re lost .
( Laughter ) Does that influence housing ?
How could that be ?
I like to see it as a sneezing shield on the planet .
The effect is that the Earth could have been protected for billions of years , from the magnetic field .
The atmosphere couldn &apos;t escape .
Mars , on the other hand , has not been protected by the absence of a magnetic field , and in billions of years , has been taken away enough atmosphere to go from the habitable planet to the planet that we see today .
Other scientists think that magnetic fields are acting more like sailing a ship , allowing the planet to interact with more energy with the solar wind than they can interact on their own .
The sails collect energy from the solar wind .
The magnetic field collects energy from the solar wind , which favors the flight of the atmosphere even more .
It &apos;s an idea that needs to be tested , but the effect and how it seems to be evident .
That &apos;s because we know that solar wind energy is deposited in the atmosphere here on Earth .
If you &apos;ve never seen them , they &apos;re beautiful .
We know that energy comes in .
We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles come out , and if the magnetic field influences somehow .
I gave you a problem , but I don &apos;t have a solution yet .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
It &apos;s designed to measure the flight of atmosphere .
We have similar measures from Venus and the Earth .
Once we get that answer , why should we care ?
It &apos;s also financially , but deeply .
It will tell us atmospheres that surround us and are close .
For example , the Kepler probe , built and controlled here in Boulder , looks at a region of the sky of the size of a postage stamp , for a couple of years , and found thousands of planets — in a part of the sky of the size of a postage stamp that we don &apos;t think is very different from anywhere in the sky .
In 20 years , we &apos;ve gone from not knowing anything about planets outside the solar system , to have so many hours now , not knowing which to analyze first .
Any thing will help .
In fact , on the basis of observations taken by Kepler and other observations like this , we now believe , that of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way alone , on average , every star has at least one planet .
In addition to that , estimates suggest that there are 40 to 100 billion of these planets that we would call habitable in one galaxy .
We have the observations of these planets , but we don &apos;t know what they are habitable yet .
It &apos;s a little bit like being trapped on a red spot — ( Laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and wanting to desperately know more about it , want to interrogate them and find out if even a couple of them are a little bit like you .
You can &apos;t do it . You can &apos;t go there yet .
So you have to use the tools that are developed for Venus , Earth and Mars , and you have to apply to other situations , and hope to make reasonable deductions from the data , and you will be able to determine the best candidates on the habitable planet , and which are not .
Eventually , and at least for now , this is our red dot , right here .
It &apos;s the only planet that we know is habitable , even though very soon we can know more about it .
But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red dot .
I &apos;m happy we &apos;re here .
Thank you .

I love the Internet .
Really .
Think about everything that brought us .
Think about all the services that we use , all the connectivity , all entertainment , all business , trade .
And this is happening now .
I &apos;m almost sure someday we &apos;ll write history books in hundreds of years — this time our generation will be remembered as the generation that went online , the generation that built something truly global .
But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , security problems and privacy problems .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these issues .
Let me show you something .
This is Brain .
This is a floppy disk — five inches and a quarter infected with Brain.A .
It &apos;s the first virus that &apos;s ever been found for PC .
And now we know where Brain comes from .
We know this because it &apos;s indicated within the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
This is the Boot sector of an infected floppy . If we look closer , we see it right here , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the underground . &quot; &quot; And then it goes on , it says , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
And Basit and Amjad are their names , their own Pachistani names .
In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and a address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
Today we are in 2011 .
It &apos;s been 25 years .
The problem with PC viruses is 25 years old .
So six months ago , I decided to go to Pakistan .
Let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photographs I took while I was in Pakistan .
This is the city of Lahore , which is about 300 miles south of Abbottabad where Bin Laden was caught .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the road or the road that leads to this building , which is at 730 of Nizam block in Allama Iqbal .
And I knocked on the door .
( Laughter ) Can you guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they &apos;re still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There &apos;s Basit up here .
Sitting his brother , Amjad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Of course , we had a very interesting conversation .
I asked them why .
I asked them what they felt when they started .
And I was quite pleased to know that Basit and Amjad computers were infected dozens of times by other viruses without any connection between them over the course of these years .
So after all , there &apos;s some kind of justice to this world .
The viruses that we were used to seeing in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s are obviously not a problem anymore .
Let me show you a couple of examples of how they looked .
What I &apos;m writing is a system that allows me to run old programs on a modern computer .
Let me load some drives . Go there .
What you see here is a list of old viruses .
Now I &apos;m going to make some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s first go to Millewalk virus .
And you can see on the top of the screen , there &apos;s a millefoot flowing down the screen when it &apos;s infected with this virus .
You know you &apos;ve been infected , because , in fact , the virus shows up .
Here &apos;s another one . This is the Crash virus invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one that makes sounds .
( Scream noises ) And the last example , guess what the Marcier virus does .
Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking on the screen once you &apos;ve been infected .
So it was pretty easy to know that you were infected with a virus , when viruses were written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , they &apos;re no longer written by amateurs and adolescents .
Now viruses are a global problem .
What you see here in the background is an example of the operating systems in our workers , where we detect virus infections all over the world .
So we can see in real time that we &apos;ve blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if I connect to our system in the lab on the Web , you can see in real time , have an idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every day .
This is the last virus we found on a file called Server.ex.
And we found it right here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
And if we run down , there &apos;s a huge amount of it .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And this is the last 20 minutes of malware , every single day .
So where do all these viruses come from ?
Today it &apos;s organized criminals who write these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
These are bands like — we go to GangstaBucks.com.
This is a website that works in Moscow where these people buy infected computers .
So if you &apos;re a virus programmer and you &apos;re able to infect Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with it , you can sell these infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these people .
And they &apos;re actually going to pay you for these computers .
So how do these people monetize these infected computers ?
There are different ways , like trojan banking , that steal money from your account online when you make online transactions , or key loggers .
The Key loggers are shrinking in your computer , hidden , and recording everything you typed .
So you &apos;re there on the computer and you &apos;re researching Google .
Every single Google research you type is saved and sent to criminals .
Every single email you write is saved and sent to criminals .
Same thing with every single password and so on .
But the things that are most searched for are the sessions you go online and buy online shops .
Because when you purchase in online shops , you put your name in , the delivery address , the number of credit card and the safety code of paper .
And here &apos;s an example of a file that we found on a server a couple of weeks ago .
This is the number of credit card , this is the date of deadline , this is the safety code , and this is the name of the paper title .
Once you have access to people &apos;s credit card data , you can go online and buy what you want with this information .
And this , of course , is a problem .
Now we have a whole underground market and a commercial ecosystem built around online crime .
One example of how these people actually are able to monetize their operations . Let &apos;s go and look at the pages of the INTERPOL and go to the people who are searched .
We find people like Bjorn Sundin , Sweden , and his complice , also put him in the lists of the INTERPOL , Mr. Shailkumar Jain , an American citizen .
These people kept an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they collected millions .
Now I &apos;m still two on the way .
Nobody knows where they are .
The American officials , just a couple of weeks ago , frozen a Swiss current account that belongs to Mr. Jain , and that current account had over 14.9 million dollars .
So the amount of money that generates cybercrime is relevant .
And that means that cybercriminals can afford to invest in their attacks .
We know that cybercriminals hire programmers , they hire people to test , test their codes , having SQL database systems .
And they can afford to see how we work — how we work with security — and try to circumvent the security barriers that we build .
They also use the global nature of the Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
And if you look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video made by Clarified Networks , which explains how a single malware family is able to move around the world .
This operation , whether it &apos;s originally from Estonia , moves from country to country , as soon as the site tries to get rid of it .
So you can &apos;t just turn them off .
They &apos;re going to go from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , exploiting the fact that we don &apos;t have the ability to navigate globally on operations like this .
So the Internet — it &apos;s like someone had given free airline tickets to all the cybercriminals in the world .
The criminals who weren &apos;t able to reach us now can do it .
So how do you find these cybercriminals online ?
How do you get them caught ?
Let me give you an example .
What you see here is an exploit file .
Here I &apos;m looking at a hexdump of a file of image , which contains an exploit .
Basically , if you try to see this image file on your PC , it actually takes control of your PC and activates the code .
Now , if you look at this image file — there &apos;s the intestation of the image , and here &apos;s the real code that begins the attack .
This code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s repeat it .
It was encrypted with XOR function 97 .
Believe me , that &apos;s it .
And we can go here and start decoding it .
The yellow part of the code is now deciphered .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t look very different from the original .
But keep looking .
You &apos;ll see down here , you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / / ioo.ex. , and when you visualize this image on your computer , it downloads you a program and it &apos;s going to play it .
And this is the backdoor that takes ownership of your computer .
But even more interesting , if we keep decoding , we find this mysterious string that says O600KO78U.S. .
That code is there crypted as a kind of signature .
It doesn &apos;t need anything .
And I looked at it , trying to figure out what that meant .
So obviously I Googlata it .
No outcome ; there was no .
So I talked to the kids in the lab .
And we have a couple Russians in our labs , and one of them thought , well , it ends up in rus like Russia .
And 78 is the postal code of the city of San Petersburg .
For example , you find it in some phone numbers , in the tags and things like that .
So I went and searched in the St. Petersburg &apos;s office , and on a long way , we found this particular site .
There &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been working online for many years who has been running his own website , and runs a blog in the most popular Diary Live .
And on his blog , he tells about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — it &apos;s a little more than 20 — he tells about his cat , his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a beautiful machine .
In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 gallons of cylinder with over 400 horses .
It &apos;s a beautiful car for a 20-year-old boy in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about this machine ?
Because he told the machine about the blog .
He had an accident .
In the middle of St. Petersburg , he tagged another car .
And he put pictures on the blog of the crash — this is his Mercedes — this is the Lada Samara that he tagged .
And you can see that the Samara &apos;s plate ends up with 78RUS .
And if you look at the picture of the scene , you can see that the Mercedes plate is O600KO78U.S. .
I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I were , at this point I would say , &quot; &quot; The case is closed . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when cybercriminals are caught ?
In many cases , you never get that far .
In most online crimes , we don &apos;t even know what continent attacks come from .
And even though we were able to find cybercriminals , very often you don &apos;t get to any outcome .
Local police don &apos;t intervene , or if they do , there &apos;s no evidence for enough , or for some reason you can &apos;t arrest .
I wish it was easier ; unfortunately it is not .
But things are changing at a very fast pace .
You &apos;ve all heard of Stuxnet .
If you look at what Stuxnet did , he infected these .
This is a Siemens S7-400 PLC , a programmable computer .
And that makes our infrastructure go .
This is what makes everything around us go .
The PLC , these little boxes with no screen , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put there , and they do their job .
For example , the elevators of this building are probably controlled by one of these .
And when Stuxnet infects one , it &apos;s a mass revolution about the kinds of risks we need to worry about .
Because all around us is managed by these things .
I mean , we have vital infrastructure .
You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food production plant , look around — everything is run by computers .
Everything is run by computers .
Everything depends on the work of these computers .
We &apos;ve become very dependent on the Internet , from things like electricity , of course , from computers &apos; work .
And this is something that creates new problems for us .
We need to find a way to continue working even though computers should come less .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) To be prepared means that we can do things even when the tools we take for granted are not there .
It &apos;s really basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about reserve solutions , thinking about things that are really important .
I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . It &apos;s true .
Think about all the services we have online .
Imagine if they took them away , if you didn &apos;t have them for one day or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried because we might not see this .
I &apos;m worried because we &apos;re going to face problems because of cybercrime .
Cyber crime is the only thing that could take us away these things .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent a life defending the network , and I feel that if we don &apos;t fight cybercrime , we run the risk of losing everything .
We have to do it globally , and we have to do it now .
What we need is more global , a work to apply international laws to find cybercriminals bands — these organized groups that are making millions of their attacks .
It &apos;s much more important than activating anti-virus or firewall .
What really matters is to find the people behind these attacks , and more importantly , we need to find the people who are about to join this world of online crime , but they still haven &apos;t .
We need to find people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunity to use their skills for the best .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing at a remarkable speed .
If you look at the graph up here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these projections of the Goldman Sachs suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
If you look at the graph for 2050 , projections say that the Chinese economy is going to be twice as much as the American economy , and that Indian is going to be almost like the American economy .
We should keep in mind that these projections were broken before the Western financial crisis .
A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the updated projections of the BNP Paribas of when China would have had a bigger ecomony than the United States .
The Goldman Sachs estimated for 2027 .
The post-crisis projections are for 2020 .
It &apos;s just a decade .
China will change the world on two fundamental aspects .
First of all , China is a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has gone up for over 30 years of about 10 percent a year .
Over a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
During the modern age , it never happened that the largest economy in the world was a developing country , rather than a developed country .
Secondly , for the first time in the modern age , the dominant country in the world — what I think China will become — is not going to be a Western country and a very different cultural roots , but very different .
I &apos;m aware that there is a certain belief in the West that while countries modernize , at the same time Western .
It &apos;s an illusion .
That modernity is just a product of competition , market and technology , it &apos;s a assumption .
It &apos;s not ; because it &apos;s influenced in the same way in history and culture .
China is not like the West and it &apos;s not going to become like the West .
It will remain , in its most fundamental , very different aspects .
The big question here , it becomes obvious ; how do we make sense to China ?
How do you understand what China is ?
The problem that we have in the West today , in a maximum fashion , is the conventional approach that sees everything through a Western mindset , through Western ideas .
We can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;d like to propose , now , three basic elements to understand what China is — so much to start .
The first is , China is not a real state .
Okay , it &apos;s been called this in the last hundred years , and yet , anyone who knows something about China knows that it &apos;s much older than that .
This is what China looks like with Qin &apos;s victory in 221 A.C. , at the end of the war — the birth of modern China .
You can compare it to the boundaries of modern China .
Or with the next Han dynasty , 2,000 years ago .
You can see that I already work on most of the known territories such as East China , where most of the Chinese lived and where they live today .
The most amazing thing about this is that what China makes sense , what Chinese means , the sense of being Chinese doesn &apos;t yield over the last hundred years or at least since the time of the nation-state , what has happened in the West , but since the time , if we want to put it that way , the state-civilization .
I &apos;m thinking , for example , about uses like ancestral adoration , to a very peculiar state conception , and in the same way , to a family conception just as peculiar to social relationships like the guanxi , to the values of Confucianism and so on .
All of these things originate during the period of state-civilization .
China , unlike the Western states and most of the United States in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as state-civilization , rather than nation-states .
There &apos;s another thing to add to you , and it &apos;s this : We certainly know that China is big and huge , both demographically and geographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we &apos;re often not very aware of is that China is extremely different and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
You can &apos;t control a place of such a scale simply from Beijing , even if we think about it that way .
It &apos;s never been that way .
So this is China , a state-civilization , rather than a nation-state .
What does that mean ?
I think it has a lot of profound implications .
Let me give you two examples .
The first is that the most important political value for Chinese is the unit , is the preservation of Chinese civilization .
We all know this as 2,000 years ago in Europe : collapse , the schism of the Roman Sacre Empire .
He &apos;s been divided and he &apos;s been there ever since .
China , over the same period of time , has propelled exactly in the opposite direction , tried painful to hold this huge civilization together , this state-civilization .
The second is perhaps more prosaic and this is Hong Kong .
Do you remember Hong Kong &apos;s return to China from Britain in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
One state , two systems .
I could bet that a few in the West believed us .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s just a specter for the dawn .
When China will put their hand on Hong Kong , it won &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; After 13 years , the political and legal systems of Hong Kong are as different as they were in 1997 .
We were wrong . But why ?
We were wrong because we thought , of course , in terms of nation-state .
Think about the unification of Germany , 1990 .
What happened ?
Basically , the Eastern was constrained by the West .
A nation , a system .
This is the nation-state mindset .
But you can &apos;t govern a country like China , a state-civilization , about the conception of a civilization , a system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
So China &apos;s reaction to the Hong Kong question — how will it be for the Taiwan issue — was completely natural : a civilization , different systems .
Let me give you another basic element to try to understand China — maybe a very reassuring one .
Chinese have a very , very different conception of race than most other countries .
You know , of 1.3 billion Chinese , 90 percent believe they belong to the same race , the Han .
This is completely different from most of the world &apos;s most populated countries .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of these countries are multiracular .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel that way .
China is multi-marginalized only .
And the question is , how come ?
I think the question is again to look for the state-civilization .
A story of at least 2,000 years , a story of achievement , employment , sanitation , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this conception of Han emerged — of course , fed by a growing and powerful sense of cultural identity .
Now the great advantage of this historic experience was that , without the Han , China could never be together .
Han identity was the concrete that kept this country together .
The great disadvantage is that the Han has a very limited conception of cultural differences .
They really believe in their superiority , and they are irrespectful to those who are not .
So their attitude , for example , to Uyghurs or Tibetans .
Or let me give you the third base block , the Chinese state .
The relationship between the state and the Chinese society is very different from Western society .
We in the West for most people seem to think — at least in the last few days — that authority and legitimacy of the state is in function of Democracy .
The problem with this proportion is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authorities among Chinese than what happens in any Western country .
And the reason is that — actually , there are two reasons , I think .
And of course , it has nothing to do with democracy , because according to our criteria , Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
And the reason is that , first of all , because the Chinese state has a very peculiar meaning as representative , as a body and guard of Chinese civilization , of nation-civilization .
This is the level China arrives at almost spiritual role .
And the second reason is because , while in Europe and North America , state power is constantly challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against church , against other sectors of the artistocracy , against trade and so on — for 11,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has never been tested .
He never had rivals .
So you can see that the way power in China has been built is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that Chinese have a different view of the state .
Where we tend to see it as an intrusion , a stranger , certainly an organ where powers are limited or defined or forced , Chinese don &apos;t see the state in this way .
The Chinese see the state as a narrow person — actually not just as a narrow person , as a family member — not just as a family member , but as a family leader , the patriarch of the family .
This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different from ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society in a different way than what happens in the West .
And I &apos;d like to suggest to you that what we deal with here , in the Chinese context , is a kind of new paradigm , which is different than anything we &apos;ve thought about in the past .
You have to know that China believes in the market and the state .
I mean , Adam Smith , already wrote at the end of the 18th century , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more sophisticated than anything else in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , except in the Mao period , it stayed like this ever since .
But it combines with an extremely strong and pervasive state .
In China , the state is everywhere .
I mean , it controls companies , many are still in public hand .
private companies , even big companies , like Lenovo , depend on many ways from the patronizing of the state .
Economic goals and so on have been fixed by the state .
And the state , of course , its authority pervades many other areas — we &apos;re familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
Not only that , it &apos;s a very ancient state tradition , a very old tradition of state conception .
I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is an example of this .
But this is another one , this is the Grand Canal , which was built first in the fifth century A.D.
And it was finally completed in the seventh century .
It runs for 1,794 kilometers , connecting Beijing with Hangzhou with Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of state infrastructure projects in China , which I suppose helps explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Diga and many other expressions of state tasks in China .
So here we have three basic blocks to try to understand how different China is — the state-civilization , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship with society .
And we still insist , in a maximum way , to think that we can understand China simply by looking at the Western experience , looking with Western eyes , using Western conceived .
If you want to know why infallibly we interpret China in the wrong way — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen in China are not right — that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I have to say , I think attitude to China is a little Western mindset .
It &apos;s almost arrogant .
It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think we &apos;re better , and so we have the universal measure .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
We refuse to face the problem of difference .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen argues that Western thinking is probably the most cosmopolitical of all cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant around the world that it has not really been necessary to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because , ultimately , it could , if necessary , achieve everything with force .
While those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact — which has been in a much weak position , compared to the West , has been forced to understand the West , because of the presence of the West in these societies .
And therefore , they are therefore more cosmopolitan than the West in many ways .
I mean , take the question of the far East .
Far East : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Now the region of the world is economically larger .
And now I &apos;m going to tell you , the people in the far East , they &apos;re much more prepared about the West than the West is on the far East .
I &apos;m afraid that this point is particularly appropriate today .
Why is this happening ? Back to the graph at the beginning — the Goldman Sachs graph .
What happens is that , very quickly in historical terms , the world is driven and formed , not by historic developed countries , but by developing countries .
We &apos;ve seen that in terms of G20 — which are rapidly climbing G7 , or G8 .
And there are two consequences .
First , the West is rapidly losing its influence on the world .
There was a striking illustration of this situation a year ago — Copenhagen , the conference on climate change .
Europe was not at the final negotiation table .
How did that happen the last time ?
I think it was about 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
And the second implication is that the world inevitably , as a consequence , becomes less and less familiar , because it will be based on cultures and experiences and stories that are not familiar with , or that we are not practical .
And finally , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe , America is slightly different — but the Europeans have to say , they &apos;re widely ignorant , they &apos;re ignorant of the way the world is changing .
Some people — I have an English friend in China , and he says , &quot; &quot; The continent is a spacecraft , it lives in a limb . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s true , maybe it &apos;s exaggeration .
But there &apos;s another problem that goes along — that Europe is less and less connected with the world — and it &apos;s sort of a loss of the sense of the future .
I mean , Europe used to , of course , lead the future based on trust .
Take the 19th century for example .
But this , unfortunately , is no longer true .
If you want to hear the future , if you want to try the future , try China — there &apos;s the old Confucius .
This is a railroad station like you &apos;ve never seen .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railroad station .
This is Guangzhou &apos;s new station for high-speed trains .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world , and soon it will have a bigger network than the rest of the world put together .
Or take this one : This is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to quickly try in a suburb in Beijing .
Here &apos;s a giant bus , on the top floor , carrying about 2,000 people .
It travels across a suburban road , and cars travel below .
And it travels at the speed of about 160 miles an hour .
That &apos;s how things are going to move , because China has a specific problem , which is different from that European and different from the United States , China has a huge , small population of space .
So this is a solution to a situation where China will have many , many , many cities that are over 20 million people .
Okay , so how would I end ?
Well , what should our attitude to the world that we see rapidly develop in front of us ?
I think there will be good things and bad things .
But I claim , first of all , a positive photograph for the world .
For 200 years , the world has essentially been governed by a small part of the human population .
This is what Europe and North America represented .
The arrival of countries like China and India — 38 percent of the world &apos;s population in two — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important part of a single act of democracy in the last 200 years .
Civilizations and cultures , who have been ignored , without a voice , that we haven &apos;t heard , that they weren &apos;t known , will have a different fate in representing the world .
As Umanians , we have to welcome , surely , to this transformation , and we have to learn something about civilization .
This great ship is the one that jumped from Zheng He at the beginning of the 15th century for its great journey around the seas of South China , the seas of Eastern China and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
The little boat in front of it was the one that , 80 years later , Colombo Cristophus crossed the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Or , look carefully on this perpetual made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Oh my God , the Chinese also invented golf .
Let &apos;s welcome the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to make the revolution .
But before I run to guns , or sing together , or pick my favorite color , I want to give you my definition of revolution .
For me , revolution is a radical and humbling change in the way we think and how we behave — the way we think and behave .
You might ask me , why , Steve , does it take a revolution ?
It takes a revolution because things are not working ; just for that .
And that makes me really sad , because I &apos;m sick to see things that don &apos;t work .
You know , I &apos;m amazed to see how we don &apos;t leverage our potential .
It &apos;s been over and over again .
And we &apos;re at the last place in so many things — for example , in social factors .
Ultimately in Europe for innovation .
There we are , at the bottom of the list , a culture that has not been created for innovation .
Ultimately in public health , that if it worked , we would all be quieter .
There we are , not just in the United States , but in the last few in Europe , right at the bottom of the graduation .
And even worse , a three-week news , you definitely have another read , published by The Economist .
We are the saddest place on the planet about the GDP per capita — the saddest place on earth .
That &apos;s what social care is about , and now we go to education .
Where were we three weeks ago in another OECD report ?
Ultimately in reading , math and science , last .
Commerce : The lowest perception in the U.S.
Entrepreneurs take advantage to society .
And what is the consequence ?
The lowest percentage of new companies .
And yet , we all know that small businesses are the engine of the economy .
We hire more than everyone , we impose more tax than everyone .
But what if you break the engine ?
The lowest GDP in Europe .
Ultimately .
So let &apos;s not wonder if 62 percent of the Bulgarians lack optimism for the future .
We &apos;re not happy , we have a bad education system , the worst commercial enterprises .
And these are facts , people .
These are not fables I want to offer you .
They &apos;re not .
And I &apos;m not even conspiracy against the Bulgaria . These are facts .
I think it should be absolutely clear that our system is in the air .
Our thinking , our behavior , our behavior operating system doesn &apos;t work .
It takes a radical change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria into a better country , better for us , for our friends , for our families and for our future .
How could this happen ?
But now we think good . We &apos;re going to change our thinking . How did that happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and it &apos;s going to sound like a drastic statement to some of you — because we hurt ourselves .
We stay back because we don &apos;t value play .
I just said play .
If anyone had forgotten what I &apos;m talking about , that &apos;s what play is .
Babies play , babies play , adults play .
But we don &apos;t value play .
We actually decapitate it .
And we do it in three fields .
Let &apos;s take a look at it .
Social debt : 45 years of what ?
Communism — society and state are more important than the individual , and inadvertently they &apos;ve been trampled creativity , individual expression and innovation .
And what do we value ?
Because it &apos;s shown that the way we apply , we create and use knowledge is influenced by the social and institutional context , what was being told in communism ?
You &apos;re serious .
We need to act serious .
It looked like this .
( Applause ) Be serious .
I don &apos;t know how many times I got caught in public gardens because I allowed my kids to play on the ground .
For charity , they play on the ground , or worse in the kal , in the water , and the germs will kill them .
The baboons and the dyads , the grandmothers and grandparents , told me we shouldn &apos;t play the kids so much , because life is serious and we have to prepare them properly to deal with life .
We &apos;re dealing with a very troubling meme .
We &apos;re threatened by social meme .
A difficult meme to fight .
It &apos;s already 45 years that we live with what I call the grandmother factor . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s how it works .
Plank one : The woman says , &quot; &quot; I want a baby . Iskam bebe . &quot; &quot; Poem 2 : Here comes the baby , evaporate !
But then what happens at point three ?
I want to go back to work , you want a career , you want to socialize .
I &apos;m going to have to rely on bekko , the baby , the grandmother .
But we don &apos;t have to forget that it &apos;s 45 years old that the grandmother was infected with the meme .
So what happens ?
It transmits the virus to the baby , and then it takes an extremely long time — a time from Redwoods — because that meme is ejected out of our operating system .
And then what happens ?
He goes to school where he persists an ancient , unchanged system in the last 100 years , which requires mechanical learning , memory and standardization , while he doesn &apos;t realize the individual expression , the exploration of himself , of questions , of creativity , of play .
A failed system .
My story : I was looking for a school for my son .
We went to this little prestigious school where they told me that mathematics was taught 10 times a week and science eight times , and reading five times a day and so on .
And we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; And when there &apos;s the interval , when they play ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Ah , but it &apos;s not predicted . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s only five years old . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a horrible mismatch .
It &apos;s a fact that our education system is so serious because education is serious , and we create brain operators that fit bullons into predisposed holes .
I &apos;m sorry , but today &apos;s problems are not the ones of the Industrial Revolution .
We need adaptability , we need to learn to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need automated workers .
But no , now the meme spreads into the workplace where the game is banned .
We create authors that we catalog as if they were corporate goods , that we could use and then dispose them .
How do we think the organization of the work should be ?
Autocratic — that &apos;s what I say because I &apos;m the boss .
I &apos;m the leader , and I know more about you .
You don &apos;t trust it — because you &apos;re definitely a criminal , I have to use cameras .
( Laughter ) I have to check — obviously you &apos;re an idiot , so I &apos;m going to create a billion little procedures for you so you won &apos;t make mistakes .
Pone of the limitations — don &apos;t use your cell phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t go to the Internet , don &apos;t use chat .
All of this doesn &apos;t seem professional and it &apos;s negative .
After all , it &apos;s an unproductive system , because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re limited , you &apos;re not appreciated and you &apos;re not even fun .
In social , in education and in working activities , we don &apos;t value work .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t like play .
You say , &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s ridiculous , Steve , that strange ideas .
It can &apos;t be because of the game .
Just for the game , it &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; The meme is inside us .
Well , I &apos;ll tell you you you &apos;re wrong .
Now I &apos;m going to show you how play is the catalyst , the revolutionary element that we can use to transform Bulgaria .
Play : Our brain is made for play .
Evolution has favored in millions , billions of years , the attitude to play in animals and humans .
And you know ?
Evolution is also very good at erasing the traits that don &apos;t present advantages to us and to privileging those that benefit us more .
Nature is not stupid , and he chose play .
Let &apos;s look at the animal kingdom , for example , the ants play .
Maybe you didn &apos;t know .
But when they play , they learn social order and dynamic things .
Rats play , but perhaps what you didn &apos;t know is that rats that play the most have larger brains and learn their homework better and develop other skills .
Members play , we all know .
But you may not know that if you private them in the game , they will not be able to interact socially .
They still can hunt , but they &apos;re not social .
Bears play .
But maybe you don &apos;t know that the bears that play the most are longer .
The longest ones are not the ones that catch more fish .
They &apos;re the ones that play the most .
And finally , an interesting study showed a correlation between play and size of the brain .
The more you play , the more the brain gets bigger .
Dolphins , remarkable brains , play a lot .
But who do you believe that you play more among the larger brain ?
But humans !
Children play , we play — apartments to any nationality , race , color , religion .
It &apos;s a universal fact — we play .
And not just the children , but also the adults .
Now a new vocabulary : neoteny — play permanent and younger aspects in adults .
Who shows more neoteny ?
Humans . We make sports .
We do it for fun , or for the Olympics , or for competition .
We play musical instruments .
We dance , we kiss , we sing , we make ecosystems .
Nature has made us play with birth to old age .
We &apos;re made to do it all the time — play and play a lot , never stop .
It &apos;s very good for us .
As animals benefit , they also benefit humans .
For example , it &apos;s seen that it stimulates neural growth in amygdala , the area that controls emotions .
It supports the development of prefrontal cortex , area preaching cognitive processes .
And what &apos;s the result ?
That we develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
We will increase the ability to decide if we play more .
Ladies , these are facts .
It &apos;s not stories , stories , I &apos;m not trying to convince you ; it &apos;s purely scientific data .
These are the benefits that we take from play .
It &apos;s an acquired genetic right , like walking or talking or seeing .
And if we deny the possibility to play , it &apos;s as if we denied one of the other genetic rights to birth .
We are the ones who want to stay behind .
Let &apos;s do a little exercise together : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
Without theatrics , without the arts , without singing , without dance , no soccer , no football , no laughs .
What does it look like ?
A little depressing .
Malinconic .
Now think about your workplace .
Is it fun ? Is it stimulating ?
Or maybe your friends &apos; friends — we expand the boundaries a little bit .
Is it a cake ? Is it playful ?
Or is it a crap ? Autocratic , which controls , limited , that doesn &apos;t trust and that doesn &apos;t satisfy ?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
We even feel guilty when we see ourselves playing work .
&quot; Oh , if my colleagues see me laughing , they think he has nothing to do , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; I have to hide otherwise the boss sees me .
It &apos;s going to think that I don &apos;t work hard . &quot; &quot; But I have new things for you : our thinking is obsolete .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play .
It &apos;s depression , depression .
It actually improves our work .
Just as there are advantages for men and animals , there are benefits if you play at work .
For example , it stimulates creativity .
It &apos;s increasing our availability to change .
Our learning ability .
It gives us a sense of purpose and professionalism — two important motivation factors that increase productivity , through play .
So if you think play is not a serious thing , play is not about being frivolous .
You know , the professional athlete who likes to ski , does it seriously , but loves to do it .
He &apos;s fun , he &apos;s in his environment , doing what he likes .
Even though doctors are serious , you know that laughter is a good medicine .
Our thinking is overcome .
But we shouldn &apos;t feel guilty about it .
We should actually celebrate the game .
A quick example from the corporate world .
FedEx , their motto is : people , service , profit .
If you treat people like this , if you make them feel important , they &apos;ll feel better , they &apos;ll feel better , motivated and with a sense of control of things .
What happens ? They provide a better service — not worse , better service .
And when customers come in and deal with happy employees who can make decisions and feel fulfilled , how will customers feel ? Surely good .
And what are customers going to do with the service ?
They &apos;re going to require more services and talk to their friends , which leads to greater profit .
People , service , profit .
Play increases productivity , not the opposite .
You might say , &quot; &quot; Hey , this works for FedEx in the United States , it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
We don &apos;t talk about it . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; But I tell you it also works in Bulgaria , for two reasons .
The first is that play is universal .
There &apos;s nothing that keeps the Bulgarians playing , except the bad meme we need to get rid of .
Secondly , I experienced it , the Sciant .
When I started , customers satisfied zero .
No client would talk well about us .
I asked everybody .
Our profits were marginal .
We were waving little , and our partners were dissatisfied .
With a few simple changes , how to increase transparency , facilitate self-determination and collaboration , encouraging collaboration and not autocracy , and to aim outcomes .
I don &apos;t want to know when you get to the office or when you leave .
I &apos;m interested in the team and the clients are happy , and do all this as a function of this .
Why should I care if you attack 9 ?
We put the accent on fun .
And we created an amazing atmosphere that allowed us to turn Sciant into three short years — it seems a long time , but it takes a while to change — and all the customers started talking about us , we had higher income to the average and happy partners .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how do you know if they &apos;re really happy ? &quot; &quot; Well , every time we participated in the best employer , we always won .
Based on the data from independent anonymous investigations .
So in Bulgaria , the system works .
There &apos;s nothing that can hold us , except our preconceptions about play .
To conclude , what we need to do to change things through play .
First , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , well , go home and think about it or think about it .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t feel the sense of the game , then you have to rediscover it .
Whatever you like as a child , or only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve had your promotion , you can &apos;t walk away , because you believe you have to be serious people , rediscover it !
I know , going to mountain bike or reading a book or playing a game .
Remind it . Because you depend on innovation , change in the way you think .
It takes you to go back to your offices or talk to your friends and make the fire of change in the game revolution .
It &apos;s you who have to do it , because if you don &apos;t hear it , they &apos;re not going to feel your colleagues and employees either .
You have to go to them and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , you have all my confidence . &quot; &quot; Strange concept . I hired you , so I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions , you &apos;re going to make it to your discretion , and I want to delegate to my subordinates , not to my colleagues and high school .
I &apos;m going to meet constructive critics .
I &apos;m going to let you question the decisions of leaders .
Because it &apos;s really rethinking what we &apos;ve always assumed that we can break down the barriers of consumerism and create innovative solutions for today &apos;s problems .
Being a leader doesn &apos;t mean being right all the time .
We &apos;re going to have to eradicate fear .
It &apos;s fear the enemy of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminating limitations .
You know what , let me use my mobile phone for personal phone calls — for charity .
Let them go to the Internet .
Let them chat them .
They take longer lunch breaks .
The lunch break takes to get off of work .
It &apos;s when you go to other people and you recreate the brain , you meet friends , you make a beer , something to eat , and you talk , that comes up with the ideas that maybe didn &apos;t come to mind before .
Give them a little bit of freedom . And generally let them play . Make the workplace fun .
We spend so much time at work , and if we let our lives be tripled , what are we going to say here at 20 years , &quot; &quot; Everything here ?
Was there anything else ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a big change in the way we act and think , but we don &apos;t need the workers revolution .
We don &apos;t need the workers revolution .
What we need are jugglers , which are a lot of people to decide to play . A lot of players .
Really , we have to be united . We can start today . What we need to do is to power the fire of the revolution . You have to share your ideas and your success stories .
about what worked and how it invigorated our lives , our schools and our work through play ; how play promotes a sense of promise and support ; how it promotes innovation and productivity ; and ultimately how play gives meaning to things .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together . And together , by sharing these ideas about play , we will transform Bulgaria into a better country .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start by proposing a strategy and all it requires is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
But before I give it to you , I want to ask you to do , now , a little control of your body and what you do with your body .
How many of you somehow make them smaller ?
Sometimes we cross our arms like this .
Sometimes we open up . ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re really fascinated by the language of the body , and we &apos;re particularly interested .
You know , we &apos;re intrigued by — ( Laughter ) a crushed interaction , or a smile , or a smile , or maybe a squeezing smile , or maybe an ammicro god , or maybe something like a handshake .
Narrator : Here they get to number 10 and look .
The BBC and The New York Times as well .
So obviously when we think about non-verbal behavior , or body language — but we social scientists call it non-verbal — it &apos;s a language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
And there are many reasons to believe that this is a correct thing .
We form sharp judgments and inferences from body language .
And those judgments can predict really significant results like those we take or who we support , who we ask to leave .
For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch a 30-second audio video of actual interactions between patient and physician , their judgment about the kindness of the doctor predicts whether the doctor will be sued in judgment or not .
If you use bad , it &apos;s a bad idea . Right ?
We are also influenced by non-verbal language , our thoughts and feelings and our physiology .
What non-verbal language am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice and teach in a competitive school business , so it was inevitable that I was interested in power dynamics .
I was particularly interested in non-verbal expressions of force and dominance .
And what are the non-verbal expressions of force and dominance ?
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s the relative to expansion .
You make yourself bigger , you expand , you take space , you basically open up .
We talk about openness . And that &apos;s true .
This expression , known as pride , was studied by Jessica Tracy . It shows how .
We make ourselves small . We don &apos;t want to connect with people around us .
And this is what happens when you put together .
If someone is really strong on our comparisons , we tend to be small . We don &apos;t respect them .
I look at this behavior in the classroom , and what do you notice ? I notice students MBA .
When they sit , they expand .
There are other people folding virtually when they enter . As they enter , you see .
I do a couple of things about this .
Women tend to do so much more than men .
Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so it &apos;s not surprising , but the other thing I noticed is that .
And it &apos;s really important in a classroom in MBA , because participation matters for half the final vote .
Business school compares with this difference of evaluation according to sex .
I started asking myself , okay , there are these people here .
There &apos;s evidence that this is the case .
So , for example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but even when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happier .
It works in both senses . When it comes to strength .
The second question was , do we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the strong , what am I talking about ?
So , how are the minds of the strong ?
It &apos;s not surprising that strong minds tend to be more assertive , safer and more optimistic .
They really feel like they can win in luck games .
There are many differences . They take more risks .
But actually , the force also has to do with stress response .
Do you want a leader with a lot of strength , dominant , with high testosterone , but very reactive to stress ?
Probably not , right ? You want a person .
We have this evidence , that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that the change of role affects the mind .
What happens if you play a role ? What happens if you do it discrete , like this little manipulation , this little intervention ?
Here &apos;s another couple of them .
You can stand up or sit down .
And these are the restricted force postures .
You fold it up , you make small .
When you touch your neck .
This is what happens . They come in .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
These are the results in terms of testosterone .
Again , in two minutes you get these changes .
Here &apos;s the cortisol data . In people with high strength .
It seems that non-verbal language really determines not just others , it &apos;s us .
Our body changes our mind .
We really think that what matters as a social threat situation . Where do you come from ?
It &apos;s not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s about you talking to yourself . What do you do ?
That &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes . It &apos;s being recorded .
For five minutes , nothing , and it &apos;s worse than being interrupted .
People hate it . That &apos;s what Marianne LaFrance calls .
And then we have these programmers looking at the videos , there are four of them .
They &apos;re in the dark of hypotheses . They &apos;re in the dark of conditions .
It &apos;s about presence leading to speech .
These kinds of things . People basically carry .
This is what drives the effect or the effect .
So I said , be fake until you do it . No — it &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like I &apos;m fake .
I don &apos;t want to be an impostor .
At 19 , I was involved in a bad car accident .
I &apos;ve been catapulted out of the car , and I &apos;ve rotated several times .
I was catapulted by the car , and I woke up with a skull trauma .
I knew my I.Q. because I had been evaluated as smart , and I had been labeled as a child prodigy .
So I leave university , I keep trying to get back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
I &apos;m an impostor .
You &apos;re going to stay and do it this way .
Like , I became this . I &apos;m really doing it . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I did . Five years of graduate school .
I don &apos;t feel it anymore , but she does , and I understand that feeling .
It can pretend , it can become .
It had changed .
So I want to tell you , don &apos;t pretend to do it .
Do it until you become it . You know ? It &apos;s not ...
Do it long enough until you become it and internalize it .
The last thing I want to leave you with is this .
Motor mines can lead to big changes .
So in two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
This is what you want to do . Configurate your brain .
Make the testosterone grow . Make the cortisol go down .
Don &apos;t get out of that situation with the feeling that you didn &apos;t show who you are .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Great creativity . You need creativity .
and discussion . creativity is surprisingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
Great creativity can spread tolerance , support freedom , make education seem brilliant .
( Laughter ) Great creativity can throw a light on the misery , or show you that your misery is not necessarily that way .
Great creativity can make politicians eligible , or unelected parties . Great creativity can make politicians eligible , or unelected parties .
It can make war seem like a tragedy or a butterfly .
Creativity has sentences to put on our T-shirt and ways to say about our mouths .
It &apos;s the explorer that shows us a simple road in the middle of an impenetrable moral labyrinth .
Science is clever , but great creativity is something less familiar , and more magical . And now we need that magic .
That &apos;s a need moment .
Our climate is changing fast , too fast .
And we need great creativity to do what they know how to do so well : indulge us to think differently with creative effect claims .
Investing us to act differently with actively actively creative clues .
Here &apos;s a similar insight from an initiative that I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
( VIDEO : Today I won &apos;t drive , I prefer to walk .
Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked , he saw things .
Things that were weird and wonderful , that would otherwise not have seen .
A deer with a lawn at a leg , a flying motorcycle .
A father and a daughter that a mysterious wall separated from a bicycle .
And then he stopped . In front of him there was her .
The woman who had run with him for the camps , and had broken his heart .
Of course , it was a little old .
Very , very much .
But he felt his old passion for her .
&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called it sweetly . It was his name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said . It was the name of him .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , 300 meters straight from here .
Let &apos;s go . Let &apos;s make love . In a tent . &quot; &quot; Ford turned off . She pulled one leg , then the other one .
Gusty walked into her with strength and made love , rhythmically , while she filmed it , as a passionate pornographer who she was .
Their passion could break rocks apart .
Since then , they lived happily and happy .
And all because he , that day , had chosen to walk .
( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve had science , we &apos;ve had a lot of discussions .
The moral imperative is on the table .
We need great creativity to take all this and make it simple and clear .
To get it to people , and then to get them to act .
So this is a call , a plica , to that community of incredible talents that is TED .
Be creative about climate change .
And just keep it quick . Thank you .

Beau Lotto : This game is very simple .
You have to read what you see . Okay ?
I &apos;m going to count for you , so we don &apos;t have to do it all .
One , two , three . Audience : Can you read this ?
BL : That &apos;s great . And this ? One , two , three . Audience : You &apos;re not reading this one .
BL : Very good . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese . And this ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
I told you to read what you see . Right ?
The letter says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar Area in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you had to say . Right ? Why ?
Because perception is rooted in our experience .
The mind takes information that doesn &apos;t make sense and gives them a sense ; we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only see what was useful to see in the past .
That means that , when it comes to perceptions , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) It leaves information . It generates a behavior that is useful . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ah ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : Sometimes , when things don &apos;t go as we want , a little annoyed , right ?
But this is about perceptions , or not ?
On perceptions , everything we think , we believe , hopes , dreams , what we wear , in love with , everything begins with perceptions .
If our perceptions are rooted in our history , it means that we only react based on what we &apos;ve already done .
But it &apos;s actually a tremendous problem , because how do you see things differently ?
I want to tell you a story about how to see things differently , and how all new perceptions start in the same way .
They start with a question .
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
Uncertainty is a bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that that &apos;s a predator there , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even sea headaches are a consequence of uncertainty .
If you go down underground , the inner ear tells you that you &apos;re moving . The eyes , moving along with the boat , tell me they &apos;re still .
The mind can &apos;t handle the uncertainty of that infomation , and it &apos;s hurting .
Ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it leads you to uncertainty .
And yet , the irony is that the only way we can do something new is to venture into that space .
So how can we ever do something new ? For luck , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And it also allows us to tackle the hardest questions , the best questions are the ones that create more uncertainty .
These are the ones that doubt the things we give to real . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how life started , what &apos;s beyond the universe , but questioning what you &apos;re looking for is really adventure into that space .
So what is the response of evolution to the problem of uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
Play is not just a process . Experts will tell you it &apos;s just a way of being .
Play is one of the unique human activities where uncertainty is instead celebrated , and uncertainty is what makes play fun .
It adapts to changes . It opens to possibilities , and cooperation . That &apos;s how we create our social relations , and it has intrinsic motivation . That means we play to play . Play is reward for itself .
Now , if we look at these five ways of being , they &apos;re the same ways as being needed to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the material section and methods of an article .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , this , valid for everything that is creative .
If we add rules as we play , we get a real game .
That &apos;s how experiments work .
So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and that experiments are a game , we wondered , can we all become scientists ?
And who would ask , not 25 children from eight to 10 ?
They are the experts . So I took my little bark of bees into a little school in Devon , and the goal was not only to get science done to children differently , but through the scientific process , to see themselves differently . Okay ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , you must say that there were no funding for this study because scientists said that children couldn &apos;t give a significant contribution to science , and the teachers who couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did the same . Obviously .
These are some of the questions . I &apos;ve written them in a small way so you don &apos;t bother to read them . The point is that five of the children &apos;s questions were actually based on scientific publishing in the last five to 15 years .
So they asked questions that are significant to experts .
Now I want to share the stage with a very special person .
She was one of the kids involved in the study , and now she &apos;s one of the youngest scientists ever published in the world . Okay ? She &apos;s going to be , once she got onstage , the younger person I &apos;ve ever talked about at TED .
In order to do science and ask questions , you need courage .
She &apos;s the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to come here and talk to all of you .
Amy , do you want to get up here ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Amy will help me tell you the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees project , and first of all , it will tell you the question they &apos;ve asked . It starts , Amy .
Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought it was easy to see the connection between humans and monkeys in a way to think , because we &apos;re similar .
But we wondered if there was a link to other animals , it would be amazing if men and bees thought the same way , because they look so different from us .
So we wondered whether men and bees could solve complex problems the same way .
Really , we wanted to find out whether bees knew how to adapt to new situations by harnessing rules and conditions that were previously understood , what if bees thought like us ?
Well , it would be very surprising , because we &apos;re talking about an insect with just a million brain cells .
But in fact , it would make a lot of sense , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower no matter what time , light , time or whatever corner they get to you . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . Children went to work and designed this experiment , and so — or , better , play — and so Amy , can you tell us what the game was and what the puzzle was .
AO : The puzzle we came up with was based on the logic back then .
We asked bees to learn not only to go to a certain color , but to a flower of a certain color only when it responds to a certain pattern .
They only got a reward if they went to yellow flowers , if yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or if blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
So there are a number of different rules that bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , what ?
What was really exciting about this project was that we , and Beau , had no idea if it would work .
It was completely new , and nobody had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : I bought teachers , and it was very hard for teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to start without an idea of what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — a lot of the merits go to Dave Strudwick , who has worked with this project .
I won &apos;t go into the details of the study because you can read it , but the next step is observation . Here are some students in the observation , and they &apos;re recording the data about where bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what do we do ? — Alunn : 5C .
DS : Is he always going up there ? — Man : Yeah .
DS : So let &apos;s just take all of you . ( Laughter ) Ounn : Henry , give me a hand ?
BL : &quot; &quot; Give me a hand , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist wouldn &apos;t say that ?
Man : There are two up there .
And three down there .
BL : So we have our observations . We have our data .
They do the simple calculations , the medium , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share it . That &apos;s the next step .
We reshape it all , and we try to scale it up for publication . So we have to reshape it .
So , of course , let &apos;s go to the pub . Okay ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine . ( Laughter ) And I say , a paper is split in four parts : introduction , materials and methods , results , discussion .
The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
Materials and methods : what did you do ? Reculted : What did you look at ?
And the discussion is , who cares ?
Here &apos;s a scientific article , basically . ( Laughter ) Children give me words . I make a story about it , so the article is written in the language of children .
I didn &apos;t write it . Amy and her classmates wrote it , and as a result , the scientific article begins with , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of the results say , &quot; &quot; Well , preparation , mystery , mystery — dice dice aaaan . &quot; &quot; Okay ? ( Laughter ) And materials and methods say , &quot; &quot; Then we put bees in the refrigerator — and we did the magic trick , ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s the first page . We see there are numerous authors .
Everybody in grassroots has been eight to 10 years old .
The first author is the Blackawton Primary School , because if you ever have to be quoted , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al . &quot; &quot; And not a single individual , and then we send it to an open access magazine , and they told us so . They told us so much , but they told us so much .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid that the article doesn &apos;t satisfy our initial qualities in many ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it begins with &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; &quot; in numbers are written nuts , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask a parer . &quot; &quot; So I sent it to Dale Purves , which is from the National Academy of Sciences , one of the major neuroscientists in the world , &quot; &quot; which is most popular . ( Laughter )
Larry Maloney , an expert in visual perception , said , &quot; &quot; The article is great .
The work would be publishable if we did it as adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We put it back to the editor .
They said no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a comment to frame the results of scientists , and we put in the reference and sent it to Biology Letters .
And there he was examined by five independent references , and it was published . ( Applause ) It took four months to do science research , two years to publish it . ( Laughter ) Typical of science , actually . This is Amy and his fellow scientists ever published .
What was the feedback ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times the first day .
It &apos;s amongst the Science Choice , among the best scientific journals .
It will always be free on Biology Letters .
It &apos;s the only article that will always be free in this magazine .
Last year , it was the second most downloaded article on Biology Letters , with feedback not only by scientists and teachers but also by the public .
I &apos;ll read you one .
&quot; &quot; I read &quot; &quot; Blackawton Bees recently . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find the words to explain exactly what I think of it .
What you did is real , right and surprising .
Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeel are the most basic and most important things to do science .
Who else can have these qualities if not children ?
He likes my compliments to his team of children . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I try it on you ? ( Laughter ) Come on , come on . Come on , come on . Okay .
Making science involves taking risks , and this is an incredible risk . ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Okay ? Because we just tried it once . ( Laughter ) She loves technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Yeah , but I also love myself .
BL : So here &apos;s the paradigm of technology . Okay .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , okay ?
It has to close my eyes and it has to indicate where my hands feel . Okay ?
( Claps ) ( Claps ) How about everybody on that scream side ? One , two , three .
Audience : ( Screams ) ( Laughter ) ( Screams ) ( Laughter ) All right . Now it opens your eyes . We do it one more time .
On that side , shout everybody . ( Screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
We normally spend our lives responding , but if we want to do something different , we need to venture into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world with new eyes .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It gives us an opportunity to venture into uncertainty through the play process .
I believe that real scientific training should be about giving people voice and allowing them to express that voice , so I asked Amy to be the last voice of this story .
Amy ?
AO : This project was very enthusiastic to me , because it gave birth to the process of discovery , and it showed me that anybody , and I say anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a great discovery .
Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or difficult . Everything depends on how that person is facing change .
But changing my view of science was surprisingly easy . After playing and thinking about the puzzle , then I realized that science is not just a boring subject , and anyone can discover something new .
You just have to have an opportunity . My opportunity came to the Beau person , and with the Blackawton Bee project .
Thank you . BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about are the world &apos;s biggest problems .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Sceptic Environment , &quot; &quot; and the book published by Bjorn Lomborg would probably be a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;m going to talk about , what are the biggest problems in the world ?
And I have to say , before I continue , I should ask each of you to take out paper and pen because I &apos;m actually asking you to help me think about how we &apos;re going to do it .
So take paper and paper .
The bottom problem is that there are a lot of problems in the world .
I &apos;m going to mention a few .
There are 800 million people dying of starvation .
There &apos;s a billion people without access to clean water .
Two billion without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
And the list goes on again .
There are two million people who will be hardly affected by climate change — and so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would all solve them , but we don &apos;t .
We actually don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do that , the question that I think we have to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why we &apos;re in the economic session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all the things , we really have to start asking ourselves , what are the ones that we should solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we said , 50 billion dollars to spend in the next four years doing something good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We &apos;ve identified 10 of the major challenges in the world , and I &apos;m going to read them briefly : climate change , transmissible diseases , conflict , education , financial instability , government and corruption , denutriation and hunger , migration of populations , sanitation and water , subsidies and trade barriers .
We believe that these in many ways conjure the biggest problems in the world .
The obvious question to ask is , what do you think the most severe problems are ?
Where should we start to solve these problems ?
But it &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
It &apos;s actually the problem that was placed in Davos in January .
But of course , it &apos;s a problem to ask people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Certainly the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve it , right ?
So the point is not to prioritize problems , but to prioritize problems .
And this may be — but of course it becomes a little bit more complicated .
for climate change that would be like Kyoto .
For contagious diseases , there would be health clinics or bed nets .
For conflict , it would be the U.N. peacekeepers , etc .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to try and do , is just in 30 seconds , and I know that in a sense it &apos;s an impossible task — write what you think are probably some of the main priorities .
And also — and it &apos;s obviously where the economy becomes bad — notice what the things we shouldn &apos;t do , first .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please take 30 seconds , speak to your neighbor , and determine what the main priorities should be and the bottom line of the solutions that we have to the most severe problems in the world .
The fantastic part of this process — and of course , I mean , I &apos;d like to — I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you a pretty substantial part of my time , right ?
I &apos;d like to go in detail , and think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And also , I urge you very strongly , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll have these arguments later , to hang on , how do we prioritize ?
Obviously , you ask yourself , why hasn &apos;t a list like this ever been done before ?
And the reason is that assigning priorities is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do that .
Of course , every organization would like to be on top of a list like this .
But each organization would also hate not to be on top of the list .
And because there are many more &quot; &quot; non-numeri-one &quot; &quot; points on the list than numbers one , it &apos;s perfectly sensible not to want to make a list like this .
We have the United Nations for almost 60 years , and we haven &apos;t actually done a fundamental list of all those great things that we can do in the world , and said , what of those we should do before ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not prioritizing — each decision means assigning a priority , so obviously we &apos;re still assigning it even if it &apos;s implicitly — and it &apos;s unlikely that it &apos;s just as functional that if we actually had a priority assignment , and we had come in and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m proposing really is that we had , for a long period of time , a situation where we had a big choice .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t know the prices , much less the size .
We had no idea .
Imagine going to a restaurant and having this big menu , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , take a pizza , you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a dollar , it could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a family pizza . It could be a pizza for a single person , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And what the top of Copenhagen is really trying to do — is to put prices on these problems .
And so , this was the process at the top of Copenhagen .
We have 30 of the best economists in the world , three in every area .
So we have three of the best economists writing about climate change .
What can we do ? What will the cost be ? And what will the benefit that we will benefit ?
The same is true of transmissible diseases .
Three of the best experts in the world who say , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do , what will the reception be ?
And so on .
Then we took some of the best economists in the world , eight of the best economists in the world , including three Nobel laureates , to meet them in Copenhagen in May of 2004 .
We called it the dream team . The Cambridge Prize winner decided to call them the Real Madrid of the economy .
This works well in Europe , but not far down here .
And what they did was they jumped out with a list of priorities .
So you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy you &apos;ve asked me — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know something about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know something about climate , you ask a climatologist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should worry about before , you can &apos;t ask any of the two , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That &apos;s what economists do .
They set the priorities .
They do it in that task in a kind of disgusting way of saying , what should we do before , and what should we do next ?
So this is the list , and this is what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see it on the site , and we &apos;ll talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , over the days .
They basically jumped out with a list where they said there were bad projects — that is , projects where if you put a dollar , you go back less than a dollar .
And then there are discrete projects , good projects and good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the great projects that we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to start from the bottom so that I can finish with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you can see at the bottom of the list , there &apos;s climate change .
That offers a lot of people , and it &apos;s probably one of those things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
How is it that it &apos;s gone up ?
And I &apos;m going to try to come back to this thing because it &apos;s probably one of those things that you &apos;re going to disagree with on the list that you wrote .
The reason I came to say that Kyoto — or do something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It doesn &apos;t mean global warming is not happening .
It doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But what it means is that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
What they basically showed us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everybody agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
It &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
It &apos;s two to three times the aid for global development that we give to the Third World every year .
And by the way , it would help very little .
All models show that it &apos;s going to advance global warming by about six years in 2100 .
So the guy in Bangladesh who is in a flooding in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
That &apos;s good , but not so much .
So the idea here is to say , well , we spent a lot of money doing a little good .
And just to give you a comparison term , the United Nations currently estimates that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the major problems in the world .
We could make clean water , health , basic health services and education to every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend a double sum to do very little ?
Or half the sum to make an extraordinary amount of good ?
And that &apos;s because it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the world &apos;s money , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
But it &apos;s to say , because we don &apos;t have them , it &apos;s simply not our first priority .
discrete projects — notice I &apos;m not going to commit all of them — transmissible diseases , basic health services — I just did it , just because , yes , basic health services are a fantastic thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s still very , very expensive .
Again , what it tells us is that suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , a lot of water and health projects come out .
Again , health and water are incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the biggest four priorities that should at least be the first to deal with when we talk about how we should tackle the problems of the world .
The fourth best problem is malaria — fighting malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of million people infected every year .
It could even cost up to a percentage of GDP per year per country .
If we invest about 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we could halve that incidence .
We could avoid the death of 500,000 people , but more importantly , we could avoid that one billion people get infected every year .
We would significantly increase their ability to fight many of the other problems that they have to fight with , of course , in the long run , even to fight global warming .
The third best was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we could make trade free , and particularly cut subsidies in the United States and Europe , we could animate the global economy to the staggering number of about 2.400 billion dollars a year , half of which would come from the Third World .
Again , the point is , we could basically pull out two or three million people out of poverty , very quickly , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way to treat malnutrition , namely , lack of micronutrients .
Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population has iron , zinc , ihatred and vitamin A.
If we invested about 12 billion dollars , we could make a huge incursion in that problem .
That would be the second best investment we could do .
And the best project ever would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what it focuses on is that there are two very different ways that we can fight HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment , the other is prevention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would both make them .
But in a world where we don &apos;t both make them , or we don &apos;t do them very well , we have to ask at least where we should invest before .
And the treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
So basically , what this focuses on is that we can do much more by investing in prevention .
Basically for the amount of money we spend , we could make X amounts of good in the treatment , and 10 times as good as prevention .
So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , first of all .
And what this really does is it makes us think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like you to look at your list of priorities and say , did you get it right ?
Or did you go close to what happened here ?
Of course , one of the things is still climate change .
I find that a lot of people find very , very unlikely that we should solve it .
We should also solve climate change if not for other reasons , just because it &apos;s a huge problem .
But of course , we &apos;re not going to solve all the problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure is , if we focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
The ones that we can do very well rather than very little .
And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , put it down very , very well .
One thing people forget is that in 100 years when we &apos;re talking about what the biggest impacts of climate change are going to be much , much richer .
Even the most pessimistic scenario in the United Nations .
It estimates that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be as rich as we are today .
More likely , it will be two to four times richer than we are .
And of course , we will be even richer than that .
But the point is , when we &apos;re talking about saving people or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bengalese .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch type .
And so the real point , of course , is , do we want to spend a lot of money helping 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
Or do we want to help very poor people , right now , in Bangladesh who really need help , and who can we help at a very low cost ?
Or as Schelling says , image of being a rich — as you &apos;ll be — a rich Chinese , a rich bureaucratic , a rich Congolese man , in 2100 thinking back in 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How bizarre they &apos;ve been interested in helping me a little bit with climate change , and if they &apos;ve become so little interested in helping my grandfather and my great-grandfather , that they could help much more and they really need our priorities .
Even though I don &apos;t agree with the typical way we see this problem .
Clearly , it &apos;s mainly because climate change is so accurate .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it sounds great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but I don &apos;t expect Emmerich to recruit Brad Pitt in his next film to dig latrines in Tanzania or something like that . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t do it for a movie .
So in many ways , I think at the top of Copenhagen and the entire discussion of priorities as a defense from boring problems .
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not to make us feel good .
It &apos;s not to do things that have media attention , but it &apos;s to create places where we can actually do as well as possible .
The other objections , I think , that are important to say are that I &apos;m somehow — or we &apos;re sort of setting up a false choice .
Of course , we should solve all the things in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
I think we should solve all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided that we would spend twice as much as we spent now , compared to 1970 in the developing world .
Since then , our aid has halved .
So it doesn &apos;t seem like we &apos;re on the way to immediately solve all the big problems .
Similarly , do people also say , and the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars because we don &apos;t spend them doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m pretty much in favor .
If any of you guys can talk to Bush about doing that , that &apos;s great .
But the point is , if I had another 100 billion dollars , we would still want to spend as much money as possible , or not ?
So the real problem here is to go back and think about what the right priorities are .
Should I say briefly , the list we have is really the right list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , you inevitably end up asking old American men .
And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the whole world .
So we invited 80 young people from around the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and speaking English .
Most of them came , first of all , from developing countries .
They all had the same material , but they could go largely outside the discussion center , and they certainly did it to get to their list .
And the amazing thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and disease at the top and climate change at the bottom .
We did this many more times .
There have been many other seminarianists and college students , and different things .
They all came to have the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , to say that I think there is a path in front of us to start thinking about priority and say , what is important in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , we &apos;d like to do everything again .
But if we don &apos;t , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the top of Copenhagen as a process .
We did this in 2004 , and we hope to bring a lot more people together that have much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
It shows the right path for the world , but also starting to think about a political choice .
Start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not do things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the big things where we can do a huge amount of good , at a very low cost , right now . At the end of the day , you can be disagreeed with the discussion of how we prioritize these but we have to be honest and frightened about whether there &apos;s something we do .
If we worry too much about some things we end up not doing other things .
So I hope this helps us prioritize and think about how we can work the best for the world .
Thank you .
The year is 1800 .
It &apos;s about a curious invention .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
It allows you to see tiny lifeforms invisible to your naked eye .
Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these life-forms cause terrible human diseases .
Imagine what happened to society when he realized that a British mom in a cup of tea was actually drinking a monstrous soup , not very far from here . This happened in London .
Fast-forward 200 years .
The monstrous soup is still around , and it &apos;s installed in developing countries around the tropics .
Malaria alone makes a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people have to be examined because at risk of different species of malarious infections .
It &apos;s very simple to make a face to many of these monsters .
They all have a face .
How is it that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda are still waiting for months to diagnose their disease ?
Most importantly , the staircase of diagnosis is is absolutely out there .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem is under the microscope itself .
Even though at the peak of modern science , the research microscopes are not designed for field analysis .
They &apos;ve never been designed for diagnosis .
They &apos;re heavy , they &apos;re ingestant , they &apos;re hard to maintain , and they cost a lot .
This picture is from Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using exactly the same equipment we use today to diagnose tuberculosis in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled to India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem .
We saw a lot of donated equipment .
We &apos;ve seen mushrooms grow under the lens of a microscope .
And we saw people with functional microscopes who didn &apos;t even know how to turn on .
From that journey and that work came up with the idea of what we call Foldscope .
What is a Foldscope ?
A Foldscope is a fully functional microscope , a microscopic platform , fluorescence , polarization , projection , all sorts of advanced microscopies made just by folding a piece of paper .
You &apos;ll think of it as possible .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples , and we &apos;re going to see a few of them .
It starts from a single piece of paper .
What you see here are all possible components to build an optical microscope and fluorescence .
There are three steps : there &apos;s the optical phase , the lighting phase and the masking phase .
There are micro-otypes in the lower part that are embedded in the paper itself .
What you do is you take it , and as if it &apos;s a toy , which is , you stunt it , and I &apos;m going to break it .
This piece of paper has no instructions , no language .
It works on color code , which says exactly how to fold that particular microscope .
When it &apos;s done , it &apos;s kind of like this , it has all the functionality of a standard microscope , just like a XY phase , a place to put a sample , for example here .
We didn &apos;t want to change it , because it &apos;s the optimized standard over the years , and many health workers have used to it .
This is what changes , but standard coloring remains the same for many diseases .
Put that in .
There &apos;s the XY phase , and then the phase in focus , with a flection mechanism included in the paper itself that allows you to move and focus the lenses with micro-motions .
The interesting thing about this object , and my students hate when I do it , but I &apos;m going to do it the same , is that these are robust tools .
I can turn it on , throw it on the ground and steal it .
They &apos;re resistant , even though they &apos;re designed with a very flexible material , like paper .
The other funny thing is — this is what we send as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldope in different configurations in a single folder .
I &apos;m going to take one at random .
We find that this is designed specifically for malaria , because it contains specific fluorescent filters for malaria .
The idea of a very specific diagnostic microscope comes from here .
Until now , you haven &apos;t seen what I see from one of these devices .
What I &apos;d like to do , if we can lower the lights , please — we find that the crowdope is also microscopes from projection .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — this is the section of a composed eye , and I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right here , in the direction of the z axis .
You can see how the lenses are cut in this section .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I like to call this one , is a mosquito , and you see the antenna of a common mosquito .
Right here .
Everything from a simple arrangement that I described to you .
My wife tested some of our microscopes in the field , washing my clothes every time I forgot them in the dry cleaner .
Apparently they &apos;re waterproof and — ( Laughter ) — this is fluorescent water , I don &apos;t know if you can see it .
This also shows how the projection ray works .
You can see the rays and the way it projects and folds .
Can we turn on the lights ?
I &apos;m going to show you very quickly , because it &apos;s running out of time , how much it costs to produce , the best idea was the production of the wheel and the wheel , so we built it with 50 cents of components and costs .
( Applause ) And this allows us to think about a new paradigm in microscopic , what we call a microscope and a bicycle .
I &apos;ll give you a quick idea of some of the parts it &apos;s made of .
Here &apos;s a piece of paper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A4 sheet .
These are the three steps you see .
The optical components , if you look at the upper-right inserts , we had to figure out how to make lenses inserted into the paper itself in large volumes , so it uses a self-assembly process and superficial tension to insert acromatic lenses into the paper itself .
That &apos;s where the lenses go .
There are sources of light .
Basically , ultimately , all the parts align with origami , because origami allows us precision at the micron level of optical alignment .
So even though it looks like a simple toy , the engineering that contains something like this is pretty sophisticated .
Here it is , and it survives .
So for us , the next step is to finish the field trials .
Let &apos;s start at the end of summer .
We &apos;re at the stage where we &apos;re going to make thousands of microscopes .
It would be the first time we did field trials with the highest density of microscopes in a given place .
We started collecting malaria data , Chagas &apos;s disease and gyardiases from patients themselves .
I want to leave you with this picture .
I hadn &apos;t anticipated it before , but an interesting link is the one between scientific education on the field and global health .
What are the tools we &apos;re providing to the kids who will fight the monstrous soup of tomorrow ?
I &apos;d like them to print a Foldscope to take it to their pocket .
Thank you .
Our world has a lot of superheroes .
But they have the worst of superpowers : invisibility .
For example , strawberries , workers who live collect recyclable materials .
Strangers are born from social inequality , unemployment and abundance of solid waste from a system of differentiated deficit differentiation .
Strangers do a heavy , honest and essential work that charms the whole population , but it &apos;s not recognized .
They come to collect over 300 kilograms of waste in their bags , carrots , bicycles and carrots .
This is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
I &apos;m a graffiti and an activist , my art is social , environmental and political .
In 2007 , I moved my work from walls to prisons as a new urban support for my message .
At the same time I gave voice to the strings .
They &apos;re now famous for roads , mass media and social media .
I &apos;ve painted over 200 prisons in many cities , and I &apos;ve been invited to make exhibitions and trips all over the world .
So I realized that strokes , in their invisibility , are not an exclusive of Brazil .
I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even developed countries like the United States and Japan .
So I realized that I needed more people to join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
( Applause )
&quot; &quot; Sistema my cart &quot; &quot; is a big collaborative event that helps track and their cart .
Strangers are seen by professionals of well-being as doctors , dentists , podologists , parruckers , physical therapists and many others .
Also , they get security magicians , gloves , emmeable and glasses to see the city in high definition , so their carrots are renewed by our incredible volunteers .
Finally , they &apos;re painted by street artists and they become part of this immense , fantastic exhibition of mobile art .
So now everybody can participate .
Because of their systemic cart , they are able to fight prejudice to increase their earnings and interact with society .
So now I want to challenge you to start looking at and recognize strings and other invisible superheroes in your cities .
Try to see the world as a world without borders or borders .
Believe it or not , there are over 20 million strokes in the world .
So the next time you see it , you recognize it as a vital part of our society .
Muito obrigado , thank you .

About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler who also talked here at TED in 2007 about Virtual Earth convinced me to become the head of Bing Maps , which is the project of online maps of Microsoft .
In the last two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working hard on redefining the way maps work online .
And we &apos;re looking at this in very different terms of the kind of maps and online directions that we &apos;re used to .
The first thing you might notice about this map online , is the fluidity of the zoom and the panoramic that if you &apos;re familiar with Seadragon , that &apos;s exactly where it comes from .
Building maps is , of course , not just a matter of cartography but also a matter of image .
So as we zoom in on a certain point , we &apos;re in a virtual Sim City view at 45 degrees .
This can be seen from any direction to show you the three-dimensional structure of the city , all the facades .
Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment as if it &apos;s a canvas on which any kind of application can overlap the road marks are just one of these .
If you click here , you &apos;ll see some that we published , just in the last two months , since we launched it .
So , a couple of days after the Haiti disaster , we had a map of the earthquake showing previous and later aerial images .
This wonderful app that I don &apos;t have time to show you is actually the hyperlocal blogs in real time , and it connects these stories , these blogs interventions with the places they relate to .
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you a few more beads .
The images we see , of course , are not just the ones from the top .
These little green dots represent &quot; &quot; photosynths &quot; &quot; made by users .
I &apos;m not going to go into the images , but photosynths is integrated into the map .
Everything that &apos;s shown in blue is an area that we &apos;ve also made a bottom-up representation .
And so , when you come down in a beat — ( Applause ) Thank you , when you come down into the soil and you see this kind of panoramic representation , the first thing you might notice is that it &apos;s not a simple picture , but it &apos;s rather a conceptual conception of the environment just like there &apos;s a city that &apos;s three-dimensional from the top , so if I click on something to get a closer view of the fact that transition appears like this is a geometry behind this .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a divergent appearance that we &apos;ve been working on in collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
Take Flickr &apos;s pictures that have been geo-tagged and used a similar process to photosynth to connect their images to our own . I &apos;m not sure this is what I really wanted to take , but — ( Laughter ) But look — this is , of course , a rather tourism place , and there &apos;s a lot of pictures around this place , and these pictures are all made at different times .
So this was done around five .
This is the picture on Flickr , this is our image .
And you can see that this kind of multi-source representation integrates , very deeply , into the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of these , of course , is the ability to travel over time .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historical images that are there , but there are some of them with horses and rows and so on .
But what &apos;s interesting about this is not just the augmented visual representation of the world with contributions coming from users , but it &apos;s also the basis of augmented reality , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you in a second .
So I &apos;ve just made a passage inside . This is also interesting .
Okay , notice there &apos;s a roof above us now .
We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
And this is something that we can do with a camera installed on a backpack , so we don &apos;t take pictures just on the street with cameras on top of the car , but we also do them in the street .
And so , you can do the same kind of capture , not just with static images , but also with video .
And we &apos;re going to try this for the first time , live , and that really scares me , really , really .
( Laughter ) Okay .
( Ringing ) Okay , guys are you there ?
( Sound ) Okay . I &apos;m doing it . I &apos;m pushing play .
I &apos;m live . There we go .
These are our friends at Pike Place Market , the lab .
( Applause ) They &apos;re transmitting live .
Okay , George , can you make a panoramic to the corner ?
I want to show you some interesting things .
No , no . On the other hand .
Yes , yes , to the corner . I can see the corner .
I don &apos;t want to show you guys yet .
Okay . I &apos;m going to throw the corner . I &apos;m going to move the corner .
Okay , let me stay .
What I wanted to show you was these interesting points here on the image because it helps you orient , if you &apos;re right at the point — you can think about it — this is a step more for augmented reality .
But what the hell do you do — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different things — Okay , attack .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is take the real world .
( Laughter ) Okay , just give me a moment to thank the team .
They did a fantastic job putting this together .
( Applause ) Now I leave them and I come back .
And as I go out , I tell you that here , we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can use it the same way on the spot , for augmented reality .
When you use it on the spot , it means you can reconfigure all those metadata and information about the world .
So here , let &apos;s take another step further in terms of transmission .
And by the way , we &apos;ve transmitted on a commercial 4G network .
OK , and there &apos;s one of the last discussions that Microsoft has done at TED in the last few years .
And this is Curtis Wong , the Planetary Telescope .
We go to the garbage geeks , where traditionally , after a long day in the market , you go and pause , but also look at the sky .
This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope in our maps .
( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time , but if we take time , we can see what the sky was like in different speakers , and all in a very detailed way of information about different speakers , several days we move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe we change the day .
I &apos;d like to zoom in on the moon .
So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated directly with the Earth .
All right now , I finished my time , so I &apos;m going to stop here .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about two things today . One , of what we lost , two , how to bring it back .
I &apos;d like to start with this .
This is my baseline . This is the coast of the Mediterranean without fish , with the rocks and many sea urchins of algae .
Something like that is what I saw when I first immersed myself in the Mediterranean off Spain .
If an alien went down to Earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe was diving into a coral reef , it would be a lot of the things he could see .
It &apos;s very unlikely that Joe can dive into an intact coral reef , a virgin reef with many corals , sharks , crocodiles , lamps , cernies , turtles , etc .
So , probably , what Joe would see would be here , in the verdict part of the picture .
Here we see the other extreme : dead corals , microorganisms in abundance and jellyfish .
Where the subaquatic is , you know , is probably the place where the world &apos;s most scattered at this moment , with very few corals , algae that exceeds coral growth , many bacteria , a place where large animals have disappeared .
This is what most scientists have seen as well .
This is their reference point . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with underwater diving long after we started polluting the marine ecosystem .
I &apos;m going to take you all to a time machine , going to the left , going back in time to see what the ocean used to look like .
Let &apos;s start our journey over time from here , the Equatorial Islands , where we conducted a series of expeditions for National Geographic .
This is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati crossing the Equator , and it &apos;s composed of several uninhabited islands , unexploited for fishing and uncontacted more than some inhabited islands .
Let &apos;s start with the first one , Ialone Christmas : over 5,000 people .
Most barriers died . Most of the corals died , covered by algae . Most of the fish are smaller than the pencil we use to count them .
Here , in 2005 , we did 250 hours of dive .
We didn &apos;t even see a shark .
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 , and he looked at a huge abundance of sharks blushing the timbers and rewards of their little boats as they approached the shore .
Let &apos;s take another little step back in time .
Fanning marrow , 2,500 people .
Corals are better here . There are many small fish .
This is what many sub would call a paradise .
This is what you can see in almost all Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
Many people think it &apos;s really wonderful , if that &apos;s your starting point .
If we go back to a place like the Palmyra atol , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are better and there are sharks .
You can see them on every single dive .
It &apos;s a pretty unusual thing for coral reefs today .
But if we take 200 , 500 years back , we &apos;ll find places where the corals are absolutely healthy and healthy to form spectacular structures and where predators are something easily detectable , where you can look at 25 to 50 sharks in any dive .
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we believed natural .
This is what we call the ecological pyramid .
If we took all the fish from a coral reef and weighed it , that &apos;s what we would expect .
Most of the biomass is at the bottom of the food chain : the herbivores , the pale fish and the storms that eat algae .
Then you have plankton eaters , little damn fish , all the little fish swimming in the water .
Then we have a smaller biomass of carnivores , and a smaller one at the top , sharks , big dentists and big cernies .
But this is a consequence .
This worldview is a consequence of studying impoverished barriers .
When we went to uncontamated barriers , we realized that the natural world was underlying . This pyramid was inverted .
The top part contains most of the biomass , reaching , in some places , 85 percent : an example is Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
The good news is that , in addition to more predators , there &apos;s more than anything .
The size of these boxes are larger .
There are more sharks , more dental biomass and even more biomass than herbivores , like the pale fish , basically sea goats .
They clean the barrier : everything that grows long enough to be seen , they eat it , they keep the barrier clean and allow the corals to reject .
Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — they host a lot of fish , but they also host other important parts of the ecosystem , like giant shellfish , giant springs of giant shellfish in the lagoon , up to 25 , 25 percent square meter .
They disappeared from every inhabitable barrier in the world , but they filter water ; they keep clean water from microbes and pathogens .
Like if it wasn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s global warming now .
If you don &apos;t fish because these barriers are protected by law or their inaccessibility , it &apos;s a great thing .
But if water warms up too long , the corals die .
What help can these fish and these predators help ?
What we noticed is that , in this particular area in the 1997 and &apos; 98 , years of El Nino , water was too hot for too long , and many corals lost color and many died .
On the island of Christmas , where biomass is extroverted , where large animals have disappeared , the corals haven &apos;t recovered .
Not even on the Fanning island , the corals got caught .
But here you can see a big coral that died and broken .
So the fish have knocked off the algae , and so the algae eat is more rare .
Then let &apos;s move to the Palmyra atol where the herbivores biomass is larger , and we see that corals are clean , and they &apos;re growing again .
When we reach an uncontaminated place — have they never lost color ?
Yes , they also suffered , but they recovered faster .
The more intact , the more complex , the more complex the food chain , the higher the resistance , the more likely the system is to take back faster than the short-term impacts of an area warming .
That &apos;s good news . And we have to recover this structure .
We need to make sure that all the parts of the ecosystem are present so that the system can adapt to the effects of climate change .
We need to reshape the starting point , we need to push the ecosystem to the left of the pattern , and how can we do that ?
Well , there are different ways .
One very clear thing is marine protected reserves , especially reserves with total fishing dividend , which we create to allow the recovery of marine life .
I &apos;d like to go back to the picture of the Mediterranean .
That was my starting point . That was what I saw when I was a kid .
But at the same time I was watching Jaques Cousteau show on TV and seeing all that wealth , that abundance , that diversity .
I thought that wealth was exclusive to tropical seas and that Mediterranean was a normal , poor sea .
Or at least I thought , until I first got into a marine reserve .
That &apos;s what I saw , millions of fish .
After a few years , pretty much after five , seven years , the fish come back , they eat the reins , and so the algae can grow back .
At first , there are only small algae , and in a rectangle of the size of a laptop , you can find more than 100 species of algae , many of which microscopic , and hundreds of fish , of small animals that fish feed on , the ecosystem can recover .
This particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , covers only 94 acres , but it carries six million euros in local locations , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the revenues of tourism .
These places not only help the ecosystem but also help people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
I &apos;d like to summarize what protected reserves can do .
When we really protect these places , when we compare them to unprotected adjacent areas , that &apos;s what happens .
The number of species grows 21 percent , so if we have 1,000 species , we can expect 200 more in a reserve .
It &apos;s very impressive .
The size of organisms grows by a third , so the fish are now big .
The abundance , the number of fish that are in a square meter , grows by almost 170 percent .
And biomass — this is the most spectacular change — it &apos;s 4.5 times larger on average , after only five or seven years .
Sometimes you get to a biomass 10 times larger within protected areas .
So we find all these organisms growing inside the reserve , and what do they do ?
They reproduce . This is biology at the base .
If you don &apos;t kill fish , they live longer , they get bigger and they reproduce more times .
Same talk for invertebrates . Here &apos;s an example .
These are eggs made out of a snail off the coast of Cilena , and that &apos;s how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
Outside the protected area , we can &apos;t find them .
1.3 million eggs per square meter inside the reserve where these snails are abundant .
So organisms breed . The little larvae move , all the organisms move , and so people outside the reserve can benefit from it .
This is in the Bahamas , a striked cernia .
We find lots of grouper in reserves , and the closer we get , the more fish we find .
So fishermen also take more .
You can see where the boundaries of reserves are from the boats aligned along them .
So fish spread . There are benefits beyond the boundaries of reserves that help people living in their neighborhoods , while at the same time reserve protects the whole habitat ; it develops recovery skills .
Basically , what we have now in a world with no reserves is like a current account that we &apos;re always taking away without even making a break .
The reserves are savings bribes .
We need to set ourselves up not to touch them so that they produce social , economic and ecological outcomes .
And if we think about the growth of biomass within reserves , we can think of it as a composite interest .
I &apos;m going to give you two more examples of how reserves take advantage of humans .
This is what fishermen earn every day in Kenya , fishing for a number of years in a place where there &apos;s no protection ; everyone weighs what they want .
When the most harmful fishing gear , the circuit networks , they were put out , the fishermen were taking more fish .
If you weigh less , you actually get more .
But if we add a protected area to all this , fishermen earn even more money from fishing around a protected area .
Another example : Trained cernies in Belize on the MesoAmerican platform .
These are mating cernies , the cernies come together in the full-moon times in December and January for a week .
Once they were gathering in groups of tens of thousands — 300,000 cernies of this size in a hectare , in one group .
The fishermen knew about these clusters ; they fished and ran out of them .
When I first went there in 2000 , there were only 10,000 cernies left .
Furthermore , fishermen were allowed to weigh 30 percent of all new babies every year .
We did a simple analysis , and it &apos;s not very complicated to understand that , if you weigh 30 percent every year your fishing activity will collapse very quickly .
And together with that disappears the entire reproductive capacity of species .
It happened in many different places in the Caribbean .
And there were about 4,000 dollars a year , all over the entire fishing zone , with a lot of boats involved .
Now , if we do an economic analysis and make a projection of what would happen if the fish weren &apos;t getting exterminated , if we just took 20 sub for a month a year , the recipient would be more than 20 times higher , and more importantly it would be sustainable over time .
How many places like this do we have ?
If it &apos;s so beautiful , and if it &apos;s so easy to understand , how many protected areas do we have ?
You &apos;ve heard it already : less than one percent of the ocean is protected .
We &apos;re approaching one percent now because of the protection of the Chagos archipelago , and only a fraction of it is completely overfishing .
Scientific studies indicate that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
The estimated percentage is 20 to 50 percent because they &apos;ve reached a range of biodiversity targets , fish development and recovery capacity .
Now , is this possible ? People ask , how much would this cost ?
Well , let &apos;s think about how much we &apos;re spending right now for fishing subsidies — 35 billion dollars a year .
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing methods .
There are a couple of estimates of what it would cost to create a network of protected areas to cover 20 percent of the ocean , and it &apos;s estimated that it would cost just a fraction of what we spend now , of what governments give to a fish to collapse .
People are losing their jobs because fishing zones collapse .
The creation of a network of protected areas would form directly more than a million people without counting the jobs that are connected and all the secondary benefits .
How can we make this happen ?
If it &apos;s so obvious that these savings bribes are a good idea for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t they cover 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
And how can we get to that outcome ?
Well , there are two ways to get there .
The obvious solution is to create really massive protected areas like the Chagos archipelago .
The problem is that we can create these huge reserves only in places where there are no people , there are no social conflicts , where the political cost is very low and it &apos;s also cheap .
Some of us , some organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on it .
But how do we do for the rest of the world &apos;s shores , where people live and earn a living with fishing ?
There are three main reasons why there are no tens of thousands of small reserves , and the first is that people have no idea what reserves can do , and fishermen tend to be very , very much on defensive when they &apos;re talking about regulating or closing a zone , even though small .
Secondly , management is not adequate because almost all the coastal communities in the world don &apos;t have the authority to deal with the resources to create reserve and to respect it .
It &apos;s a hierarchical structure at the pyramid where people are waiting for government to come , and it &apos;s not an efficient way , and governments don &apos;t have enough resources .
And that brings us to the third reason , and the reason we don &apos;t have much more reserves is that funding models are wrong .
NGOs and governments spend a lot of time , energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
So ocean preservation and protection have become a public and private money discharge , and that &apos;s not sustainable .
The solutions are in solving these three questions .
First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create entirely better protected areas than we have right now .
It &apos;s always the story of the savings leap compared to the current account where we never come .
Secondly , we need to redesign our government systems so that conservation efforts can be decentralized , and they don &apos;t depend on the work of NGOs or government agencies , and that they can be created by local communities as it happens in the Philippines and in some other places .
Third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
Money discharge as a single way to create protected areas is not sustainable .
We really need to develop models , financial models , where coastal conservation is an investment . We already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
I &apos;d like to end with a thought , and say that no organization alone will save the ocean .
There &apos;s been a lot of competition in the past , and we have to develop a new model of really collaborative cooperation , where we go for complementity , not replacement .
The stakes are simply too high to keep on the way we are .
We have to act . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you , Enric .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
Chris Anderson : A really wonderful job of collecting and exposure .
First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid showing 85 percent of the biomass composed of predators , seems really impossible .
How can 85 percent survive 15 percent ?
Enric Sala : Well , imagine you have two dental wheels of a watch , a big one and a small one .
That big one moves very slowly , and the small one moves very fast .
That &apos;s basically it .
The animals in the lower skins of the food chain are breeding very quickly , growing very fast , deposing millions of eggs .
There are sharks up here and the big fish that live 25 , 30 years old .
They breed very slowly . They have slow metabolism . They basically do nothing but keep their biomass .
Eventually , the productive surplus of the organisms at the bottom is enough to maintain this biomass that doesn &apos;t move .
I &apos;m a kind of a condenser for the system .
Chris Anderson : Very fascinating .
So , in fact , our image of the food pyramid is completely — we have to change it completely .
Enric Sala : Sure in the sea .
What we found in coral reefs is that the reverse pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , where there are five lions for every wild animal .
On the ground this scheme can &apos;t work .
But surely coral reefs are a system where there &apos;s a component on the bottom that has a structure .
And we think it &apos;s universal .
But we &apos;ve only begun to study incontacted barriers recently .
Chris Anderson : The numbers you showed us are amazing .
You say we spend 35 billion dollars right now in subsidies .
It would cost only 16 billion to transform 20 percent of the ocean into protected marine reserves that really provide new lifestyle choices to fishermen as well .
If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for less 19 billion dollars .
We would have 19 billion to spend in health or something .
Enric Sala : And we also need to consider the scarce productivity of fishing that costs another 50 billion dollars .
Again , one of the great solutions is to persuade the World Trade Organization to move subsidies to sustainable practices .
Chris Anderson : All right , there are lots of examples that are sort of out there about how to stop this crazy subsidies .
Thank you for those numbers .
One last personal question .
Many of the experiences that people have experienced , who have been through the oceans for a long time , have been able to degrade , places that once were wonderful , slowly have ruined , have died .
Tell me about the feeling that you have to feel when you &apos;ve reached those areas that are uncontamated and you &apos;ve seen things resurrect .
Enric Sala : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We go there trying to understand the ecosystem , trying to measure and count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the ones we know .
But the best feeling is this biofilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , when humans experience this sense of admiration and wonder in front of wild nature , inviolated nature .
And there , just there , you really feel like you &apos;re part of something larger , part of a global ecosystem .
And if it wasn &apos;t for these places full of hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this work .
It would be too depressing .
Chris Anderson : Well , Enric , thank you very much for sharing with us a little bit of that spiritual experience . Thank you .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
It &apos;s 1995 I attend university and with a friend of mine , we take a trip to Providence , Rhode Island in Portland , Oregon .
You know what it looks like , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we take all the secondary streets through regional parks and national forests — basically we take the longest path there is .
And somewhere in the middle of the South Dakota , I turn to my friend and ask her a question that was tormenting me for over 3,000 miles .
&quot; What do you think about the Chinese character that I keep seeing on the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks awkward at me .
Well , there &apos;s a gentleman here in the front row imitating her perfectly .
( Laughter ) And I say to her , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , those signs that we keep seeing with that Chinese character . &quot; &quot; And she looks at me for a few moments , and then she bursts laughing , because she figured out what I &apos;m talking about .
And I &apos;m talking about that .
( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese ideogram indicating a picnic area . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations like this — why we sometimes misinterpret the signs that surround us , how we behave when it happens , and what can tell us all about human nature ?
In other words , as Chris said , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about wrong .
Now , this may sound like a strange choice for my career , but it has a huge advantage in it : there is no competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we are wrong .
We just accept it abstract .
We know that everyone in this room makes mistakes .
In general , human species makes mistakes — OK .
But when it comes to me , all I believe in , now in the present , suddenly this recognition that we &apos;re not infallible ends up outside the window — and I struggle to think about something that I &apos;m wrong about .
The fact is that the present time is what we live in .
In the present time we go to the meetings ; we go on vacation with our families ; in the present time we go to the voting polls .
In fact , we place order by traveling through life , trapped in this bubble that makes us feel right compared to everything .
I think that &apos;s a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us as individuals , in our private and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us from a cultural perspective .
What I want to do today , first of all , is tell you about why we are stuck in this feeling of being in the right place .
And then , because it &apos;s such a problem .
And finally , I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to abandon this attitude and that , if you do , you &apos;ve made the single jump in itself bigger , moral , intellectual and creative that you can do .
So why are we stuck in this attitude of being right ?
One of the reasons has to do with the idea of wrong .
Let me ask you a question — or better , let me ask you a question because you &apos;re here : How do you feel — emotionally — how do you feel when you &apos;re wrong ?
All right . Pollice verse .
It &apos;s embarrassing . Okay , perfect , right .
And yet , the thumb toward it is awkward — thank you , these are perfect answers , but they are answers to a different question .
You &apos;re responding to me : How do you feel that you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) And realizing that torture can make you feel like these and many other ways , right ?
I mean , it can be devastating , or it can be revelatory , or it can be funny , like my stupid mistake on the Chinese ideogram .
But being wrong doesn &apos;t make us feel in any way .
Let me give you an example .
Do you remember that cartoon of Loony Tunes where there &apos;s that pathetic coyote that &apos;s always there that chases and doesn &apos;t capture Beep Beep ?
Basically in every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment when the coyote chases Beep Beep and the bird jumps down from a cliff , which is okay , it &apos;s a bird , it can fly .
The fact is that the coyote is running behind him and he &apos;s going to throw himself down .
The thing that makes you laugh — at least if you &apos;re still six years old — is that even coyote doesn &apos;t bend .
He keeps running — until he looks down and realizes it &apos;s in midair .
It &apos;s only then that it falls .
When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we see it , but first — we &apos;re like that coyote after jumping off the cliff but not looking down .
You know , we &apos;ve already made the mistake , we &apos;re already in the puppies , but we still feel like we &apos;re in an iron bill .
I should actually correct myself on something I said a little bit ago .
You feel something wrong ; you feel right .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s a structural reason why you &apos;re stuck in this attitude of being in the right place .
I call it error blindness .
In most cases , we &apos;re not given any internal clue that allows us to understand when we &apos;re wrong , until it &apos;s too late .
There &apos;s also a second reason why we &apos;re stuck in this attitude — and it &apos;s cultural nature .
Think about it for a moment in elementary years .
You &apos;re sitting there in the classroom , and the teacher gives you the homework , and one looks like this .
That &apos;s not mine , I want to point out .
( Laughter ) So there you are at school , and you know exactly what to think about the child who did that job .
It &apos;s the tuna child , the combine gai , the one that never does homework at home .
So when you reach nine , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that those who are wrong are pitched and irresponsible tuna — and as a second thing , that for success in life you never have to make mistakes .
This lesson we learn about perfection .
And many of us — and I suspect , especially most of us here — are addressing it simply by becoming the first of the class , perfectionists , success .
Right , Mr. Financial , astrophysicist and ultramarathonet ?
( Laughter ) Now it turns out you &apos;re all financial directors , astrophysics , ultramaratonets .
Okay , perfect .
Except that then we go to paranoia to the only chance of being wrong .
Because according to this logic , wrong on something coincides with having something wrong with us .
So we persevered to want to be in the right , because it makes us feel brilliant and responsible and safe .
Let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , a woman came to the hospital Beth Israel Deaconess for an operation .
Beth Israel in Boston .
It &apos;s the Harvard University hospital — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken to the operating room .
They do anesthesia , the surgeon does what he has to — he removes it , he reanimates it .
Everything seems to have gone for the best .
She wakes up , looks at her , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why did they blow me off the wrong side ? &quot; &quot; Well , they fought her the wrong part of the body because the surgeon did an operation with his flames on his left leg rather than on the right .
When the vice president for the quality of hospital health service told this incident , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; Whatever was the reason , the surgeon believed he was on the right side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The core of the story is that trusting too much of being on the right side of anything that can be dangerous .
This profound feeling of being in the right that so often all of us feel is not a reliable guide for everything that happens in the real world .
Common us as if it were , and by pretending to contemplate the possibility that maybe we &apos;re wrong , that &apos;s when we end up doing things like reversing 800 million liters of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or silent the global economy .
This is a huge practical problem .
But also with a social flap .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think what you believe in perfectly respects reality .
And when you feel that way , you have a problem to solve , which is how will you explain why so many people disagree with you ?
So it turns out that we are in many ways giving us the same explanation , relying on a whole series of unfortunate assumptions .
The first thing we do when someone disagrees with us is to assume that they are ignorant people .
People who don &apos;t have access to the same information that we have , and that when we share it generously with them this information , they will see light and they will deploy on our side .
When the assumption doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out they know exactly what we know and continue to disagree with us , then we go to the second assumption , which is , they &apos;re idiots .
( Laughter ) They have all the pieces of the puzzle , but they &apos;re too cretional to put them together correctly .
And if this doesn &apos;t work too , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have the same information about us , and it &apos;s fairly smart people , then we get out the third assumption : that they know the truth , and they distort it deliberately for their own biecko back .
And it &apos;s a catastrophe .
This attachment to feel from the right side doesn &apos;t help us prevent mistakes when we have absolute need and cause us to treat each other harm .
For me , the most staggering and tragic thing about this is that it gives us the ultimate sense of being human .
It &apos;s as if we wanted to believe that our minds are perfectly transparent windows through which we look outside and describe reality as it happens .
And we want everyone to look out of this same window and see exactly the same thing .
That &apos;s not true , and if it were , life would be really boring .
The miracle of our mind is not that it allows us to see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that we can see it for how it &apos;s not .
We can remember the past , we can think about the future , and we can imagine what someone else would be like in some other place .
And every one of us does it differently , and that &apos;s why we all look at the same blue at night and we see this and this one and this one .
And yes , of course , it &apos;s also the reason we &apos;re wrong .
1,200 years before Descartes famously said the famous phrase , &quot; &quot; So I think I &apos;m , &quot; &quot; This guy , Saint Augustine , &quot; &quot; he was thinking and he wrote &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I &apos;m going to cut so I am . &quot;
Augustine understood that our ability to combine trouble , is not one of the many awkward defects of the human system , something that can be eradicated or overcome .
It &apos;s deeply linked to our identity .
Because unlike God , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s really going on out there .
And unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to understand it .
For me , this obsession is the source and root of all our productive and creative ability .
Last year , for various reasons , I found myself following many points of radio transmission from the American Life .
Imagine , I &apos;m listening and listening , and then at some point , I feel that all stories are related to being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I drank my brain .
I became the crazy lady of mistake .
And I see this thing everywhere , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s exactly what happened .
But two months later , I had the opportunity to interview Ira Glass , the conductor of the program .
I present this thing to him , and he says , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s actually true .
In fact , &quot; &quot; go on , &quot; &quot; in colleagues , we always joke that every single dot in the program has the same secret theme .
And the secret theme is , &quot; &quot; I thought something would happen , and something else happened . &quot; &quot; And the fact is , &quot; &quot; Ira Glass says , &quot; &quot; we need it .
We need these moments of surprise , of inversion and inexhaustion because these narratives work . &quot; &quot; And all of us , public generally , that we are listeners or readers for this stuff we &apos;re going crazy .
In stories , we like unintended forestry and surprise finals .
When it comes to telling stories , we like making mistakes .
Of course we know , our tales are like this because our lives are like this .
We think something else will happen , and something else happens .
George Bush thought about attacking Iraq , finding a lot of weapons of mass destruction , liberating a people and bringing democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened .
Hosni Mubarak also thought he was going to be a dictator of Egypt all his life , until he was too old or sick and he would have spent all the powers on his son .
And something else happened .
And maybe you also thought that you would grow up , you would be married with your high school boyfriend and you would be back to your hometown to grow your relatives together .
And something else happened .
And I have to tell you that I also thought about the book that I was writing as a failure on a fear that everybody hates and for an audience that would never be concrete .
And something else happened .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
For better and for worse , we build these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world spins in another direction and amazes us .
Without offense , but this whole conference is an incredible monument to our ability to fail .
We spent a whole week talking about innovation , development and improvement , but you know why we need these developmental and improvement innovations ?
Because only half the stuff is really incredible and it &apos;s going to change the world — TED 1998 — huh .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t really work that way , right ? ( Laughter )
Where my backpack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) There we go .
Things always go like this .
And we respond to another idea .
Let &apos;s tell another story .
Or let &apos;s give another talk .
The theme of this , as you &apos;ve been told all millions of times , is the cover of wonder .
To me , if you really want to marvel to you again , you have to decide to come out of the tiny , terrifying space of being in the right place and look around you and look at the immense complexity , the mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
On November 5 , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and murdered the Rabbine Meir Kahane , the leader of the League of Ebraica .
Nosair was initially declared not guilty , but as he served a penalty for prosecutors , he began to plan attacks , along with other men , at a dozen snowlegic points in New York , including tunnels , synagogue and the central seat of the United Nations .
Fortunately , those plans were dispersed by an FBI informant .
Unfortunately , that wasn &apos;t the case for the World Trade Center in 1993 .
Nosair was convicted of his involvement in the conspiracy .
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , 1983 , by my father , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother , elementary school teacher , who together looked for me in all ways to give me a happy childhood .
It was only at the age of seven that in our family , dynamics began to change .
My father introduced me to a side of Islam that a few people , including most Muslims , can see .
I know from experience that when people take time to interact with each other , they quickly realize that , most of all , in life we look for all the same things .
However , in every religion , in every population , you can find a small percentage of people so fertely attached to their beliefs that they feel in order to use whatever means they need to make others live like them .
A few months before his arrest , he sat down and explained that , in the last weekends , he and some friends had gone to a pulling pole in Long Island to practice .
He told me I would go with him the next morning .
We got to the Calverton typography , which in the unknowns of our group was surveyed by the FBI .
When it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me keep the rifle on my shoulder and explained how to aim the target at about 28 meters away .
That day , the last bullet I shot hit the orange light at the top of the target and surprised everyone , but in particular my own , the target caught fire .
My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic he said , &quot; &quot; ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; That father , that son .
Everybody seemed to laugh at crayons after that comment , but only a few years later I understood what they thought was funny .
They thought they were seeing in me the same destructive that my father was capable of .
Those men were then convicted for putting a van with 700 kilograms of explosive in the basement of a World Trade Center parking lot , causing an explosion that killed six people and killed another 1,000 .
That was the kind of people I faced .
That was the kind of people I called &quot; &quot; adu , &quot; &quot; uncle .
At the age of 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability , during my childhood , gave me the opportunity to make real friends .
Every time I started feeling comfortable with someone , it was time for me to do the suitcase and move .
Being the eternal face of the class , I was often targeted by bullets .
I was secreting my identity from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but apparently , being the new package of the class was already enough .
So I spent my time mostly at home , reading books , watching TV or playing video games .
So I was socially charming , to use euphemism , and growing up in such an intolerant environment , I wasn &apos;t ready for the real world .
I was trained to judge people on the basis of arbitrary parameters , like race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of the first experiences that challenged my way of thinking I lived in the 2000 presidential elections .
Through a university training program , I could be part of the National Radge of Philadelphia .
The focus of my group was about the violence of young people , and having been a victim of bullying for most of my life , I was particularly passionate about this topic .
The members of our group came from different walks of life .
One day , at the end of the convention , I discovered that one of the kids I had friends with was Jewish .
It took several days for that detail to come to light , and I realized there was no natural hostility between us .
I had never had a Jewish friend , and frankly I felt proud that I was able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life led me to believe insurmountable .
Another breakthrough point was when I found a summer job at the Busch Gardens , a divergent park .
There I connected with people from all religion and culture , and that experience turned out to be fundamental in the development of my character .
For most of my life , I was taught that homosexuality was a sin , and that , as a result , all gay people were negative influence .
But notice , I had the opportunity to work with gay artists at a show , and soon I discovered that many of them were among the most good people , and the least critical I had ever known .
Being a child bullying victim created a sense of empathy to other people &apos;s suffering , and now I &apos;m not natural to treat good people differently than I would like to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to counteract the stereotypes that were enchanted as a child with real life experiences and interactions .
I don &apos;t know what it means to be gay , but I know what it means to be judged for something that is outside my control .
Then there was &quot; &quot; Daily Show . &quot; &quot; Every night , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my intolerance and helped me realize that the race of a person , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of their character .
In a way , it was a father for me , when I was desperately searching for one .
Inspiration can often come from unexpected places , and the fact that a Jewish comedian did more , to positively influence the view of the world , of a extremist like my father remained inside .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my view of the world was changing , and she told me something I &apos;m going to take in my heart all my life .
He looked at me with the eyes of those who tried dogmatism to take for a whole life , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy that takes all that hatred .
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to cut bridges with my father and start a new life .
Why , then , should I come out of the closet and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I do it in the hope that maybe someone , one day , forced to use violence , can feel my story and realize that there is a better way to do it , that although I was submitted to this violent , intolerant ideology , I didn &apos;t become a fanatic .
I chose instead of using my experience to counter terrorism , intolerance .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism imposed them .
For the victims of terrorism , I &apos;m going to speak openly against these insensate acts and hide my father &apos;s actions .
With that simple fact , I &apos;m here to prove that violence is not intrinsic to religion or race , and the son is not held to follow the father &apos;s footprints .
I &apos;m not my father .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
I &apos;m honored with the invitation , thank you .
I &apos;d like to talk about interesting things for me , but unfortunately , I &apos;m afraid what interests me is not a lot of others .
First of all , my card says I &apos;m an astronomer .
I &apos;d like to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people interested in radiation transport in non-gray atmospheres and the polarization of light in the high atmosphere of Jupiter corresponds to the number of people who can be under a bus retirement .
So I won &apos;t talk about that .
( Laughter ) And it would be just as funny to talk about things that happened in 1986 or 1987 , when a hacker was infiltrating into our systems at the Lawrence Berkeley Laborators .
I captured the guy , and it turned out he worked for the time , KGB overeign , steal information and sell it .
And I &apos;d like to talk about this — it would be fun — but , 20 years later ...
I find cybersecurity quite a bit boring .
That &apos;s a real tedium .
I — the first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second is engineering .
The third is just being a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do one thing , I do another one .
So I won &apos;t talk about that .
And I &apos;m not even going to talk about the statements that I think are obvious about my first book Silicon Snake Oil , or my second book , I &apos;m going to talk about why I think computers don &apos;t have to go into schools .
I think there &apos;s a curious and widespread belief that we need to bring more computers into schools .
My idea is : No ! No !
Get them out of schools and leave them out .
And I &apos;d like to talk about this , but I think the topic is really obvious to anyone who has gone through a fourth grade and doesn &apos;t have to talk about it yet — I think I may have tortured , and a lot of this and all I just said .
Then don &apos;t go and read my dissertation .
It probably includes lies .
That said , I deligned my talk five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And if you look right here , the most important thing I wrote on my thumb is the future .
I should talk about the future , right ?
All right . My feeling is that it &apos;s strange to ask me to talk about the future , because I have gray hair , then it seems silly to me that I talk about the future .
Actually , if you really want to know what the future is going to look like , if you really want to know something about the future , don &apos;t ask a technician , to a scientist , to a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask anyone who writes programming code .
No , if you want to know what society is going to look like in 20 years , ask the teachers of kindergarten .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask any of the teachers , ask anyone who has experience .
They know what society will look like in the next generation .
I don &apos;t know . And even , I suspect , everyone who talks about what the future will take us .
Of course , anybody can imagine all those beautiful things that are going to be there .
But for me , things are not the future .
What I &apos;m asking myself is what society will look like when today &apos;s children are phenomenal with messaging and they &apos;re standing for very long time in front of a screen , but they &apos;ve never played bowling in the company .
The change is happening , and the change that happens is not what &apos;s happening in software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d like to talk about it , it would be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m currently doing . What am I doing right now ?
Oh — the other thing I &apos;d like to talk about is right here . Right here .
Can you see ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is objects on one surface .
I really want to talk about things that have one surface .
Because I like the rings of Mobius , not only do I love the rings of Mobius , but I &apos;m one of the few , if not the only ones in the world , building Klein bottles .
There you go , I hope you &apos;re all stuck .
This is a bottle of Klein .
For those in the audience who already know , raise your eyes to the sky and say SI , I know everything .
It has one side . It &apos;s a bottle in which it &apos;s its outside .
It &apos;s got zero volume . It &apos;s not orientable .
It has fantastic properties .
If you take two rings of Mobius and you climb the edge that they have in common , you &apos;ll get one of these , and I made them glass .
And I &apos;d like to talk a lot about it , but I don &apos;t have a lot of — you know , because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I have a cold . ) Anyway , &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; TED &quot; &quot; is obviously for design .
Just two weeks ago , I built — you know , I made Klein bottles small , medium and big enough to trade .
But what I built — and I &apos;m pleased to present it here for the first time in public .
This is a bottle of Klein for wine , which , although it has four dimensions and doesn &apos;t have to be able to hold a fluid , is perfectly capable of doing it because our universe has only three dimensions of space .
And because our universe has only three dimensions of space , it &apos;s able to contain fluids .
And most importantly — this is the most beautiful one .
It represents a month of my life .
Even if I really want to talk to you about topology , I won &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to remember my mom , who was missing last summer .
It would collect my pictures , like moms do .
Could anybody turn on this thing ?
I got his album last , and I found a picture of me standing — well , sitting , in 1969 , in front of a group of diamonds .
I looked at it and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my ! This is me when I was working on electronic music studio !
I worked as a technician , fixed and maintened the electronic music studio at SUNY in Buffalo . Wow !
ancient Macachine . And I said , SI !
And it sent me back in time .
Just after that , I found another photograph in his album , a picture of me .
This guy here is clearly me .
This is Robert Moog , the inventor of Moog &apos;s synthesizer , who came to eat last August .
Robert Moog was a generous , gentle man , an extraordinarily competent engineer .
A musician who took his time to teach me , a sophomore in the second year , a new man arrived at the SUNY of Buffalo .
It came from Trumnansburg to teach me not just Moog &apos;s synthesizer , but we were sitting there — I studied physics then . It &apos;s in 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a great thing .
Don &apos;t get you caught by electronic music if you &apos;re studying physics . &quot; &quot; He was mentor . He came in and spent hours with me .
He wrote for me a recommendation letter for college admission .
On the background , my bicycle .
I realize this picture was made in my friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Moog came there with a lot of material just to explain to Greg Flint and to me things like this .
We were talking in the living room about the transformations of Fourier , the functions of Bessel , the transfer function of modulation , things like that .
Bob &apos;s death last summer was a loss for all of us .
There &apos;s no musician who has not been deeply influenced by Robert Moog .
( Applause ) Now I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . What I &apos;m going to do — I hope you can recognize a distorted sinusoidal wave , a nearly triangular wave on this Hewlett-Packard oscillope .
Great . Now I can go all the way up here , right ?
Children . Children are what I &apos;m going to talk about . Right ?
There &apos;s children written here , here &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
I decided that , at least for me , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
So I think locally and I act locally .
I think the best way to hand anything is to do it very locally .
So Ph.D. here , graduate school , and all the escape .
I was talking about it with a bunch of teachers about a year ago .
And one of them , a lot of them turned to me and said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you teach me ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I taught graduate students — I had graduate students , I also taught high school classes . &quot; &quot; &quot; No , they said , if you &apos;re so taken by children , why are you not here in the front line ?
He goes from the words to the facts . &quot; &quot; Right . I go . I teach science to eighth grade students four days a week .
And I don &apos;t just show me every now and then .
No , no , no , no , no . They &apos;re always there .
Even at lunch . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , it &apos;s not for applause .
I &apos;m convinced that this is a very good thing to do for each of you .
You don &apos;t rush into the classroom every now and then .
Teach the week . Okay , I do this for three quarters of the week , but that &apos;s enough .
One of the things I did for my science students was to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to teach you the physics that you teach at college .
No calculation , we skip it .
You don &apos;t need to know trigonometry .
But you &apos;re going to have to know the algebra that &apos;s in third grade , and so we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
Nothing like &quot; &quot; aprite-al-chapole-sect-fat-fat-fat-block-for-profit &quot; &quot; kind of thing .
We &apos;re going to do real physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m going to try to do now .
( Singing ) Oh , before we turn on this device , one of the things we did in the classroom three weeks ago — this is because of the lenses , and one of the things we did with the lens was to measure the velocity of light .
My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a kick of oscilloscope , they measured the velocity of light .
With a 25 percent approximation . How many third-grade students do you know how to measure the speed of light ?
In addition to that , we measured the velocity of sound .
I &apos;d like to measure the speed of light right here .
I organized myself to do this here and I thought , &quot; &quot; Great , &quot; &quot; I was about to impose my presence to the constituted powers , and measure the velocity of light .
I was so organized , organized to actually do it , but then it turns out that to set up the equipment there are only 10 minutes .
And there &apos;s no time to do that .
So next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light .
But meanwhile , we measure the velocity of sound !
Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce the sound on something and measure the echo .
But probably — one of my students , Ariel , asked , &quot; Can we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
And you all know that the wave equation is : the frequency multiplied by wavelengths , of any wave .
It &apos;s a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelengths go down . The wavelengths go up , the frequency goes down . So we have a wave here — there it is , this is interesting — as the amplitude goes up , the waves get closer , the expansion goes down , the waves go away .
Right ? This is just physics .
You all know that from the third grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you about physics — third-grade physics — but they should — and I wish they &apos;d done it — is that if you multiply frequency by the wavelength of sound or light , you get constant .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
So to measure the speed of sound , all you need to know is frequency . It &apos;s simple .
I have a frequency measure here .
Impose it on a third . It &apos;s an La , more or less .
Now I know the frequency .
It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I &apos;m now measuring the wavelength .
All I need is add another signal , this signal down here is me speaking , right ?
All the time I talk , you see it on the screen .
Now I &apos;m going to put it here and how I get out of the source , notice the spiral .
The sinuous movement . We &apos;re going through various nodes of the survey , and we &apos;re going to do this .
For the physicists between you , I hear you &apos;re putting your eyes up to the sky , but take patience . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I have to do is measure the distance from here , an entire wave , all the way to here .
From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
So if I put a meter here , I &apos;m going to step back here .
I moved from here to here about 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here to here , 20 centimeters .
Okay , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
Let &apos;s say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelengths were 0.2 meters long .
Let &apos;s calculate how much it does .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 by 0.2 is 352 meters per second .
If you look at the textbooks , the speed is 343 .
But here with some slippery material and some crap — we were able to measure the speed of sound with a approximation — not bad . Very good .
And that leads to what I wanted to say .
Let &apos;s go back to this picture of a million years ago .
It was 1971 , there was the Vietnam War , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my god ! &quot; &quot; physical study : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
I &apos;m coming home , half-course vacation . There &apos;s a riot on the campus .
There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , we ended up with Elmo . I &apos;m sorry .
There &apos;s a campus riot , and the police are chasing me , right ?
I &apos;m walking the campus . The police arrive and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Get out a rifle . And &quot; &quot; buum &quot; &quot; !
A big tear like a Pepsi can now skip my head . Woosh !
I grow a gas mouths , and I can &apos;t breathe anymore .
The policeman followed me with a rifle .
He wants to put it on his head !
And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to run away from here ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going through the fastest campus I can . I &apos;m going to go into the Hayes Hall .
It &apos;s one of those buildings with the flytower .
The policeman is chasing me .
He follows me to the first plan , then a second , then to the third floor .
He &apos;s following me in this room .
It &apos;s the entrance of the change tower .
I close the door behind me and I start getting up , beyond this place where there &apos;s a pendulum swinging .
And I think , right , the square root of the length is proportional to the time . ( Laughter ) I keep going , I &apos;m going to step back .
I come to this place where a loser jumps .
There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , watch , watch .
Time is going back because they &apos;re inside .
I &apos;m thinking about the contraction of Lorenz and Einstein &apos;s relativeness .
I keep going up , and I get to this place , right at the bottom , where you go up with a wooden scale .
I come up and I find a dome .
A dome , one of those three meters tall .
I look out and I see the policemen who just stick their students on their head , and they disappear tears and I look at the students who brick .
And I ask myself , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? And then I think what my English professor would tell me in high school .
And that is that when you merge the bells , you make encryptions .
So I take the pigeon excrements out of one of the bells and look at them .
I wonder , why am I here ? So now I want to tell you what the words engraved in the Hayes Hall Tower : &quot; &quot; The truth is one .
In this light , they can be science and religion here for the constant evolution of humanity , from tenaces to light , from closing to openness of minds , prejudice to tolerance .
It &apos;s the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
And while I was on the veranda , crashing into my pockets , I found that I had no keys .
In fact , I could see her from the window , on the dining room table , where I had left her .
I went around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were all closed .
I thought I &apos;d call a manufacturer , at least I had a cell phone , but at midnight , it would take a while before it came in , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t go back to Jeff &apos;s house and stay for the night because the next morning I had a flight to Europe and I needed the passport and the suitcase .
It would have cost a lot , but probably not more than a manufacturer in the middle of the night , so I thought , given the circumstances , I would have been there .
I have a background as a neuroscientist , and I know how the brain works when it &apos;s under stress .
It leaves cortisol , which increases your heart rate , regulates your adrenalin levels and anneys reasoning .
So the next morning , when I woke up after too little sleep , worried about the hole in the window , with a mental note that I had to call the hive and the frozen temperature and the meetings that I had in Europe and with all that cortisol in my brain , my mind was annoyed , but I didn &apos;t know it was , because the mind was annoyed .
( Laughter ) And only when I got to the check-in airport , I found I didn &apos;t have the passport . ( Laughter )
So , I went home , with snow and ice , 40 minutes , took the passport and went back to the airport , and I just got there in time , but they had given my place to someone else , so I found myself in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in a non-reclinable seat , on an eight-hour flight .
I had a lot of time to think in those eight hours and without sleep .
( Laughter ) I started to wonder , are there things I can do , methods that I can apply , that prevent things from happening bad ?
Or at least , if bad things happen , to minimize the possibility that they become a total catastrophe .
So , I started thinking about it , but the idea didn &apos;t get clear to me until a month later .
I was at dinner with my colleague , the Nobel Prize Danny Kahneman and a little embarrassed , and I told him that when I broke the window , and I forgot the passport , and Danny told me that he was practicing something called the anticipated homeless .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he took from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written some years earlier , which is also called the pre-mortem .
We all know what a post-mortem is .
When a disaster happens , experts come in and try to figure out what happened , right ?
Well , according to Danny , in pre-mortem , you &apos;re looking forward and trying to figure out what might go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to avoid these things happening , or to minimize the damage .
So , what I want to talk about today is some of the things we can do in pre-mortem .
Some are obvious , some are not so obvious .
I &apos;m going to start with those obvious ones .
In the house , you assign a place to the things that are easily lost .
Now , that sounds good , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science supporting it , based on the way our spatial memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , which has evolved over tens of thousands of years , which is known about the place of important things — where the well is , where you can find the fish , where the fruit trees are , where the tribes and the enemies live .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in the London taxi is expanding .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find the peanuts .
If you asked you , it was an experiment where you took off the squirrels the sense of smell , but they found the food the same .
They didn &apos;t use the smell , they used the hippocampus , that mechanism in the well-developed brain to find things .
It &apos;s very good for the things that don &apos;t move very much , not so good for the things that move .
That &apos;s why we lose the keys of the car , the glasses and the passports .
So , at home , you assigned a place for your keys , a hook next to your door , or a supermobile .
For the passport , a particular drawer .
For glasses , a particular table .
If you assign a place and you &apos;re meticulous , things will always be there when you look for them .
What about the journey ?
With the phone photographed the credit cards , the driver , the passport , send them into an email so they &apos;re on the network .
If these things are lost or stolen , it &apos;s easier to do with new things .
Now , these are pretty obvious things .
Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
Corstisol is toxic and causes brain annebition .
So part of pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not at the best of shape and you should have a method .
And maybe there &apos;s no more stressful situation than when you &apos;re faced with a medical decision to take .
And at some point , we &apos;re all in the situation where we have to make an important decision about our future health care , or those of us who care or help them decide .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a particular medical condition .
But it &apos;s an example for all kinds of medical decisions and also for financial and social decisions and for every decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of facts .
Suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I &apos;ve just had the test results , his cholesterol is a little high . &quot;
We all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease , stroke , stroke .
The numbers needed to treat .
And this , the NNT , what is it ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take a drug or do surgery or medical procedure before a subject benefits .
And you think , what kind of statistic is this ?
It should be one .
The doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it doesn &apos;t help me .
But in fact , medicine doesn &apos;t work that way .
And it &apos;s not the fault of doctors . If it &apos;s somebody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s scientists like me .
We didn &apos;t quite understand the underlying mechanism .
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of drugs only work on 30-50 percent of people .
So the number you need to treat for the most common statina , what do you think it is ?
How many people have to take it before it &apos;s useful ?
300 .
This is from the studies of the Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband , confirmed independently by Bloomberg.com.
I also studied numbers .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they prevent heart failure , stroke or other unpleasant events .
You probably think , OK , a 300 chance of lowering cholesterol .
&quot; &quot; Doc , why not ? I give it the same . &quot; &quot; But at this point you should ask another statistic , which is , &quot; &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
For this particular drug , the side effects occur on five percent of patients .
You &apos;re 15 times at risk that the drug is going to hurt you more than it can help you .
Now , I &apos;m not telling you to take the drug or not .
I just say you should have this conversation with the doctor .
Medical ethics demands this , it &apos;s part of the principle of informed consent .
You have the right to have access to this kind of information , to start saying whether you want to run the risk or not .
Now you might think I &apos;ve invented the number to create effect , but in fact , this number is pretty typical .
For the most common operation in men over 50 years , the removal of prostate cancer , the necessary number is 49 .
Right . 49 operations are done before one person benefits .
And the side effects in this case happen in 50 percent of patients .
They include : impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
And if you &apos;re lucky and you &apos;re one of the 50 that has them , they only last for a year or two .
So the idea of pre-mortem is to think ahead of the questions that you might ask , that they &apos;ll move the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to create this at the moment .
And you want to think of things like the quality of life .
Because often , you have the choice : I want to live less but without pain , or to live more , but perhaps with a lot of pain towards the end ?
That &apos;s what you have to talk about and think now , with your family and loved ones .
You may change your mind at the moment , but at least , you &apos;ve practiced with this kind of thinking .
From a predator , the digestive system you don &apos;t need , you don &apos;t need libid or the immune system , because if the body consumed metabolism for these things , and you don &apos;t react quickly , you could become the lion lunch , and then none of those things will matter .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes away when you &apos;re under stress is logical and rational thought , as Danny Kahneman demonstrated and his colleagues .
We need to teach ourselves to think ahead of these kinds of situations .
I think the important point is to recognize that we are not perfect .
Every once in a while , we all fail .
The idea is to think ahead of what failures might be , have a method that helps minimize damage or prevent bad things happening .
Going back to that nevous night in Montreal , when I came back from the journey , I put a mix tape with openness next to the door , with the key to the door , an easy combination to remember .
And I have to admit , I still have lots of mail that I have to put in place and piles of emails that I still have to read .
So I &apos;m not quite organized , but I see organization as a gradual process and I &apos;m coming to it .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning !
Are you all awake ?
I don &apos;t have the card with my name anymore , but I wanted to ask you — did anybody write their name in Arabic on the billboard ?
Right ? All right , there &apos;s no problem .
Once upon a time , not a long time ago , I was at a restaurant with a friend and we were ordering .
I looked at the waiter and I asked him , &quot; Do you have a menu ? ( Arabic )
He looked bad at me , thinking he felt bad .
He said , &quot; &quot; Excuse me ? ( English ) &quot; &quot; So I repeated , &quot; &quot; The menu , please . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know how you say it ? &quot; &quot; Of course you do . &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in English , or &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; The French pronunciation is correct ?
The waiter said , &quot; Come here ! Just take care of this ! &quot;
It seemed disgusted to talk to me , as if by itself and itself thought , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t even look at it if it was the last girl in the world ! &quot;
But what does it mean to say &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A young Lebanese girl took two words to label a girl as a simple and ignorant .
But how does he talk like this ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
He made me angry .
It just hurt me !
Do I have the right to speak my language in my country ?
But what country do we live in ?
How did we get here ?
While we are here , there are many people like me who at some point in their life , without wanting to , abandon everything that has happened to them in the past , just to say they &apos;re modern and civilized .
Should I forget my whole culture too , my thoughts , my intellect and my memories ?
The stories of when we were small are the best memories we have of war !
Do I have to forget everything I &apos;ve learned in Arabic , just to conform me ?
To become one of them ?
What does that mean ?
But nonetheless , I tried to understand that waiter .
I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he had judged me .
The Arab language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language that &apos;s suitable to science , research , it &apos;s not a language that we &apos;re used to in universities or in jobs , a language that we rely on to conduct cutting-edge research projects , and it &apos;s not even a language that we use at the airport .
If we tried it , they would keep us in our underwear .
So where can we use it ? It &apos;s a question we could ask all of us !
You want us to use Arabic . Where can we use it ?
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another , more important , that we should take into account .
The Arabic is our native speaker .
Research has shown that , in order to master other languages , you have to master your own .
Getting your tongue is a prerequisite to express yourself creatively in another .
But how ?
Jubran Khalil Gibran , when he approached writing , used Arabic .
All of his ideas , his imagination and philosophy have been inspired by this child , in the village where he grew up , breathing certain odors , feeling certain voices , and thinking about certain things .
So when he started writing in English , he already had a big bathroom .
Even when he wrote in English , when we read his works in English , we breathe the the same odor , we feel the same feeling .
We can imagine he &apos;s writing in English , the same kid coming from the mountains , from a village on Monte Lebanon .
This is an example that you can &apos;t beat .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that to eradicate a nation , the only way to eradicate a nation , is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that all developed societies are aware of .
Tedeschi , French , Japan , Chinese : they &apos;re all aware of it .
That &apos;s why there are laws for language preservation .
They do something sacred about it .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
Do we know more about them ?
Okay , we don &apos;t come from the developed world , these innovative visions from us haven &apos;t come yet , and we want to match the civilized world .
Countries that used to be in the same situation , but they decided to engage in development , they dedicate to research and they connect with those countries , countries like Turkey , Malaysia and others , have brought their language into the development race , protected it as a diamond .
They kept it tightly .
Because if you buy a Turkish product , or another country , and the label is not in Turkish , it &apos;s not a local product .
You would never believe it &apos;s a local product .
They would come back to be consumers , simple naive consumers , as we are most of the time .
So , to innovate and to produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence &quot; &quot; what comes to mind ?
Sounds familiar , right ?
Regardless of who , how and why .
A language doesn &apos;t just need to communicate , it &apos;s not just words .
Language represents specific stages in our life , terminology tied to our emotions .
So when I say &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each of us creates a different mental image , which connects specific feelings of a specific day , in a specific historical moment .
Language is not one , two or three words or letters put together .
It &apos;s an inner idea of how we think , how we see others and how others see us .
What is our intellect ?
How do I know if someone &apos;s got it or not ?
So if I say &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your son asks you , &quot; Dad , you were when people were walking around saying &quot; freedom &quot; ?
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see anything strange about it , maybe it &apos;s better for me to go away and stop talking empty .
The point is that these expressions remind us of something specific .
I have a franfond friend who married a French friend .
I once asked her how she went .
He said , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent the whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &quot; &quot; toqi &quot; &quot; because he understood it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That poor man had used &quot; &quot; toqborni &quot; &quot; without thinking about it , and then he spent the night trying to explain it to him .
He didn &apos;t understand , &quot; &quot; How do you get so cruel ?
Will it not want to commit suicide ?
&apos;Serpelliscimi ? &apos; ( In English ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just an example .
But we realized that he can &apos;t use that word with his husband , because he doesn &apos;t understand it , and he &apos;s not wrong ; he has a different way of thinking .
My friend told me , &quot; &quot; Listen Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate it to him , because he could feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; The poor man tried to translate a song that said , &quot; &quot; From them I extended my hand and I stole you ... &quot; ( Laughter ) And here they start the problems : &quot; And because you belong , &quot; ( Laughter )
Traducate it , if you can .
( Applause ) And what have we done to protect the Arab language ?
We turned it into a civil society problem , and we launched a campaign to safeguard the Arabic .
And yet , many people told me , &quot; &quot; What do you care ?
Get out of it and go for fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arab Service campaign uses a slogan that says , &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you &apos;re responding to me from the west . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because otherwise we would have been misunderstood .
And when someone talks like this to me , they hate me the Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and to be convinced in a way that enables our dreams , aspirations and daily lives .
A way that goes like us and think like us .
So &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you &apos;re responding to the west , &quot; &quot; he middle .
It &apos;s very simple , but at the same time creative and compelling .
After that , we launched another campaign with images of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example out there , the image of a letter surrounded by a yellow and black ribbon with the written , &quot; Don &apos;t kill your tongue ! &quot;
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
It &apos;s something we really shouldn &apos;t do .
If we kill our language , we should find another identity .
We should find another life .
We should start again .
It would go far beyond losing the opportunity to become modern and civilized .
We also published pictures of boys and girls with an Arab letter on them .
I &apos;ve been watching kids and girls cool .
We &apos;re very cool !
And everyone who says to me , &quot; &quot; Ah ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I adopted the word &quot; cool . &quot; &quot; Let me show you that protestine , until they give me a more beautiful word and a better word for reality .
I &apos;m going to keep saying &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d never say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the world wide web ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t sound good ! Let &apos;s not get around .
But to get to this point , you have to be all convinced that we shouldn &apos;t afford any bigger than us or that they think they have some power on us when it comes to language , to control or to help us think and feel what they want .
The key is creativity .
Maybe we can &apos;t go into space , build a rocket and so forth , but we can always be creative .
In this particular moment , each of you is a creative project .
What we need to pursue is creativity in our native speaker .
Let &apos;s start right away .
We write a novel or we make a courtyard .
It could only take one novel to make us global again .
to bring Arabic back to the top of the chart .
So it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; the solution is there .
But we need to be aware of it and be convinced that the solution exists that it &apos;s our job to be part of this solution .
To conclude , what can you do today ?
Let &apos;s see , tweet , who &apos;s tweeting ?
Please ask you , I &apos;m asking you to knee , even though my time is already crushed , they &apos;re okay Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write in Arabic with numbers like Latin numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! Not a language .
You &apos;d walk into a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from a place like this and reconnect .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
But we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to point out the reflectors about the need to safeguard this language .
Let me tell you a secret .
An infant recognizes his father through language .
When my daughter is born , I will say , &quot; &quot; Honey , this is your father . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say to her , &quot; &quot; Honey , this is your dad . &quot; &quot; And at the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor that if she says , &quot; &quot; Thank you . ( Arabic ) &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Come on , Maman , &quot; &quot; and I hope nobody &apos;s heard that .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this form of cultural humiliation . ( Applause )
Sustainability is the thing , where and how it &apos;s been taken .
Who and why they are what matters to me .
I want to know the people behind my culinary choices .
I want to know my impact on them .
And I want to know about their impact on me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on what they find in the water for their livelihood .
Understanding all of this allows us to shift our perception of seawater products from looking at them as a commodity to consider them an opportunity to fix our ecosystem .
It also allows us to celebrate the products of the sea that we &apos;re so lucky to eat .
How do we call this all ?
We could call it regenerative fish .
If sustainability is the ability to resist and maintain , regenerativity is the ability to fill and progress .
The regenerative fish supports a dynamic system in evolution and recognizes our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we can make an effort to repopulate the ocean and encourage its resistance .
It &apos;s a way that gives hope , it &apos;s a more human way , it &apos;s a more useful way to understand our environment .
Depliant informative — a standard tool for many in the world of marine protection — are very comfortable , a wonderful tool .
Green , yellow and red are listing species .
The association is very simple : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , on the yellow , think about it twice .
But for me , it &apos;s not enough to eat just what &apos;s in the green list .
We can &apos;t support it without measuring our successes to really change the fate of species in yellow and red lists .
What if we really ate just from the green list ?
There &apos;s a fish tuna with the tuna — it comes from sustainable reserves .
Play with the cann , there &apos;s no bycatch .
Very good for fishermen . A lot of money . The local economies were incentive .
But it &apos;s a sea lion . It &apos;s a fundamental predator .
What is the context of this meal ?
Are I sitting in the restaurant with a half-mile transit ?
Do I do it three times a week ?
I &apos;m probably still on the green list , but I &apos;m not favor myself , for you , or at least in the ocean .
The point is that you have to have a context , a measurement unit for our actions in this field .
Example : I &apos;ve heard red wine is wonderful for health — antioxidants and minerals — great for heart .
Fantastic ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to start getting a lot of it . I &apos;m going to be in perfect health .
So how many bottles do I have to drink before somebody tells me I have a problem ?
Ladies , we have a protein problem .
We &apos;ve lost that capacity of judgment when it comes to our food , and we &apos;re paying for the price .
The problem is that we are hiding that price under the waves .
We are hiding that price behind the social acceptance of expanding waisters .
And we &apos;re hiding that price behind monstrous profits .
The first feature of this idea of regenerative fish is that it really holds our needs .
The regenerative fish could be represented not by Squalo , by Flipper , or by Capitan Findus , but perhaps by the ninth of Valuit advertisements .
The vegetables : they can still save the oceans .
Sylvia says the blue is the new green .
I &apos;d like to respectfully suggest that the green dot is the new blue .
We need to keep eating the best possible fish , if we really need to .
But we also have to eat it with a ton of vegetables .
The best part of the regenerative fish , though , is that it gets to you in its shell with a little bit of Tabasco and a little bit of lemon .
It gets you in portions of two tilapia tilting tables of Digion and scratch , accompanied by a lock with quinoa and nuts and grilled broccoli and crooks , all beautifully delicate , sweet , hustled and smoothed outside with just one tip of heartbeat .
Whooo !
It &apos;s easy to sell .
And the best part is that all of these ingredients are available for every family in the supermarket behind the house .
Jamie Oliver is doing a campaign to save America from the way they eat .
Sylvia is fighting to save the oceans from the way we eat .
You can see the pattern .
Forget nuclear holocaust ; we have to worry about forks .
We sacrifice the land and then use the food that we collected to hurt us more than one way .
I think all the way we eat is wrong .
And I also think it &apos;s time that we change our expectations about food .
Sustainability is complicated , but dinner is a reality that we all understand quite well .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s a lot of recent movement to make our food greener .
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are passionately driving Delicious Revolution .
But vegetables often represent a way for us to transcend our responsibilities as consumers .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with enough in the dish .
There are the eco-compatible shrimp .
We can do it ; we have technology .
But there &apos;s never going to be a buffet that serves that loose-execo-friendly scamp .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
Food healthy for the heart is an important part of the regenerative fish .
While we &apos;re trying to preserve marine populations in decline , the media recommend us to increase our fish consumption .
Studies say that tens of thousands of grandmothers , grandparents , mothers and fathers in America could earn many years of life if we included more fish .
It &apos;s a result that I don &apos;t want to let go .
But it &apos;s not just fish .
It &apos;s also the way we look at our dishes .
As a chef , I realize that the easiest thing to do is to reduce the size of the ports .
A couple of things happened .
I earned more money .
The customers started ordering ancient meals and salads because they knew they wouldn &apos;t just get satiated with the main plate .
People started spending more time on the table , spending more time together during meals .
People basically got more than what they wanted to get , even though they got less protein .
They received more calories over a diversified meal .
They &apos;re healthier . I make more money .
It &apos;s fantastic .
Environmental conservation is served with every plate , but it &apos;s served with a huge amount of protection for human interests at the same time .
Another thing we did was to diversify the species that were used : small , blue fish , leatherbacks , rubber , sardine became common .
Mollusses , coats , oysters , vongles , tilapia , salmon , all very widespread species .
We were addressing gates to higher resistance , to more sustainable options .
That &apos;s what we need to encourage .
This is what the green list says .
But it &apos;s also the way we can begin to regenerate our ecosystem .
But what happens to the big predators ? The sort of fashion ? At that tuna in the green list I talked about before ?
Well , if you really have to , I have a recipe for you .
It works pretty much the same way for any big ocean fish , there it is .
Take your half-kilogram range .
Take a knife and cut it in four parts .
Put them on four dishes .
You fill those four dishes of vegetables , you grab the best bottle of wine you have , you turn off the candles and celebrate that fish .
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat it .
Invest friends and neighbors and do it every year , maybe .
I expect a lot from food .
I expect health , joy , family , community .
I expect that producing ingredients , preparing plates and consuming meals are all parts of the community of human interests .
I was fortunate enough to have a great chef as my father .
He made me realize very early that privilege is being able to eat .
I remember the food of my childhood very well .
There were reasonable proteins , accompanied by large amounts of vegetables and small doses of starch , usually rice .
I still kind of eat the same way .
I feel bad when I walk into a steakhouse .
I get cold sweats .
It &apos;s like a protein sock .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But of all the bad news that you &apos;ll hear and that you &apos;ve heard about the conditions of the ocean , I take the unfortunate burden of having to give you perhaps the worst of all , which is that your mother always was right .
You eat the vegetables .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
What do you look for in a meal ?
For health , I look for complete ingredients that are good for my body .
For joy , I look for butter and salt or other exotic things that take away from my food the flavor of penitence .
For the family , I look for recipes that honor my personal stories .
For the community , we said it from the beginning .
You can &apos;t avoid the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
So try to know as well as possible what this impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
We saw an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
But it &apos;s more than just a resource deposit ; it &apos;s also the global geography of that sharing that we call food .
If we all take what we need , we can start sharing the rest , we can start celebrating , we can start regenerating .
We need to taste vegetables .
We need to taste smaller portions of fish .
And we have to save dinner .
Thank you .

Good morning , I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world that builds buildings with paper , like this cardboard tube , and this shows the first one I did using cardboard tubes .
1986 , very , very long before people started talking about ecological and environmental problems , I started testing the cardboard tube to be able to use it as a building structure .
It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for buildings , but this is much more resilient than I expected , and it &apos;s also permeable . Also , being an industrial material , it &apos;s also resistant to fire .
Then I built a temporary structure in 1990 .
This is the first temporary building of paper .
It &apos;s made of 330 tubes , about five centimeters in diameter , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters .
As you see in the picture , there &apos;s the toilet inside .
If you &apos;ve finished toilet paper , you can turn it off the wall . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s very useful .
In 2000 , there was a big exposure in Germany .
I was asked to design the building , because the theme of exhibition was environmental problems .
So I was chosen to build the pavilion with cardboard tubes , recycled paper .
The goal of my creation was not to complete it .
My goal was to demolish the building , because all countries do a lot of pavilions , but after six months , you create a lot of industrial waste , so my building had to be reused or recycled .
Eventually , the building was recycled .
That was the goal of my project .
Then , I was fortunate enough to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in Metz City .
Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to take my students to Paris to build an office at the top of the Pompidou Center in Paris all by myself .
We took cardboard tubes and wooden joints to complete this 35-foot office .
We stayed there for six years without paying the rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you ! I had a big problem .
We were part of the exhibition , so even though my friends wanted to see me , they should have paid the ticket .
That was the problem .
Then I finished the Pompidou Center in Metz .
Now it &apos;s a very popular museum , and I &apos;ve created a big monument for the government .
But I was deeply disappointed about my architect &apos;s profession , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society . We work for privileged , rich , governments , developers .
They have money and power .
These are things that are invisible .
So they hire us to visualize their power and their money by creating huge architectures .
This is our profession , even historically , is the same , even now we &apos;re doing the same .
So I was very disappointed not to work for society , even though there are so many people who lose their home because of natural disasters .
But I have to say that they &apos;re no longer natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes never kill people , it &apos;s the collapse of buildings killing people .
This is the responsibility of architects .
Then people need temporary housing , but there are no architects working on it because we &apos;re too busy working for the privileged .
So I thought that even as architects , you can be involved in rebuilding temporary housing .
We can make them better .
That &apos;s why I started working in disastrous areas .
In 1994 , there was a huge disaster in Rwanda , in Africa .
Two tribes , the Hutu and the Tutsi , fought .
More than two million people have become refugee .
But I was surprised to see the refugee camp organized by the United Nations .
They &apos;re so poor , people frozen under the covers in the rains season , and in the refugee built by the U.N. , they only provided a plastic canvas , and the refugees had to cut the trees .
But more than two million people cut trees .
It turned into a huge deforestation and an environmental problem .
That &apos;s why they started providing pipes , &#91; unclear &#93; , &#91; unclear &#93; .
Very expensive , money thrown , and they cut other trees .
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using recycled cardboard tubes because they &apos;re cheap and resilient , but my budget is only 50 dollars per unit .
We built 50 units to do a moisture resistance test and termites and so on .
Then , a year later , in 1995 in Kobe in Japan , there was a big earthquake .
More than 7,000 people were killed , and in cities like this Nagata district , the whole city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
I also found that many Vietnamese suffering refugees gathered in a Catholic church — the building was completely destroyed .
So I went there and proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church with cardboard pipes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , are you nuts ?
After a fire , what do you propose to me ? &quot; &quot; He never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t resign myself .
I started traveling back and forth in Kobe , and I met the Vietnamese community .
They lived in this way under very poor plastic canvas in the park .
So I proposed to rebuild . I collected money .
I created a cardboard shelter for them , and I made it easy to build for students and even easy to demolish , I used beer helmets for the foundations .
I asked the manufacturer of the Kirin beer , because at the time , the manufacturer of Asashi beer made the red beer boxes , which doesn &apos;t fit into the color of cardboard pipes .
Color matching is very important .
I still remember we were expecting beer in plastic bags , but they got empty . ( Laughter ) I remember I was disappointed .
During the summer with my students , we built over 50 shelters .
At the end of the priest , he finally trusted me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you raise money on your own , you bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; We spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
He should have stood up for three years , actually stayed up for 10 years because people liked it .
And then in Taiwan there was a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate the church , so we dismantled it , sent it to make it voluntary .
It &apos;s in Taiwan now as a permanent church .
This building became a permanent building .
So I ask myself , what distinguishes a permanent building from a temporary building ?
Even a paper building can be permanent until people like it .
Even a building in concrete can be temporary if it &apos;s made to make money .
In 1999 , in Turkey , the great earthquake , I went there to use local materials to build a shelter .
2001 , Western India , I also built a bomb shelter there .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and the tsunami , I reconstructed the villages of Islamic fishermen .
And in 2008 , in Chengdu , in the Sichuan area in China , more than 70,000 people were killed , and in particular , many schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authorities and the contractors .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with Chinese students .
In a month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
It &apos;s still in use , even after the recent earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Aquila , there was also a big earthquake in Italy .
This is a very interesting picture : the former Prime Minister Berlusconi and the former , former , former Japanese Prime Minister Mr Aso — you know , we have to change the prime minister every year .
They &apos;re gentle motion to support my model .
I proposed a great reconstruction , a temporary concert hall , because the Aquila is very famous for music and all concert halls were destroyed , so the musicians moved .
So I proposed to the mayor to rebuild a temporary auditorium .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you put money on it , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was lucky .
Berlusconi brought G8 , and our former prime minister came , and they helped us raise money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
In 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly . So I went to Santo Domingo , the next country , and I drove six hours to get to Haiti with the students of Santo Domingo , to build 50 shelters with local cardboard tubes .
This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in Northern Japan .
After the earthquake and the shrubs , people had been evacuated in a big hall , a gym .
But look here . There &apos;s no privacy .
People are suffering mentally and physically .
So we went there to build dividend with all the volunteer students , with cardboard tubes , a simple shelter from a tube structure and tents .
However , some authorities didn &apos;t want us to intervene , because according to them , they become difficult to control .
But we really need to do that .
They don &apos;t have enough planning areas to build regulatory housing on a plan like this .
Look here . The government also makes temporary housing so poor , so dense and so chaotic because there &apos;s no room , there &apos;s no water loss , so I thought we had to make buildings more plans because there &apos;s no ground and it &apos;s not even very convenient .
So I proposed it to the mayor while I was making the dividers .
I finally met this very nice mayor in the village of Onagawa in Miyagi .
He asked me to build a three-story housing on a baseball field .
I used containers , and also the students helped us do housing to make them comfortable , and I joined the government budget and using exactly the same area , but in a much more convenient way .
A lot of people want to stay here forever .
I &apos;m glad I know .
I &apos;m now working in New Zealand in Christchurch .
About a dozen days before the earthquake in Japan , they also had an earthquake , and many Japanese students were killed . The most important cathedral in the city , the Christchurch symbol , was completely destroyed .
I was asked to rebuild a temporary cathedral .
This is under construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that people love .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What happens in this child &apos;s mind ?
If you had asked this question 30 years ago , many , including psychologists , would have said that this child was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t see with the eyes of another person or understand the mechanisms of cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , behavioral science has shocked this image .
Somehow , we believe that the thoughts of this child are like the thoughts of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you an example .
One thing that might think of this child , that might pass through his mind , is to try to understand what &apos;s going on in another child &apos;s mind .
After all , one of the hardest things for us is to understand what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the most difficult thing about all is to understand that what they think and feel others is actually not exactly what we think and feel .
Anyone who has followed policy can report how difficult it is for some people to get there .
We wanted to know whether babies and small children can understand this profound thing about other people .
The question is , how can we ask them ?
Babies , after all , don &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what they think , what you get is a conscious monologue that &apos;s stuck on bridges and birthday and things like that .
So how do you ask the question ?
It turns out the secret is broccoli .
What did we do — Betty Rapacholi , a student of mine , and I — we gave the kids two dishes of food : a plate of simple broccoli and a plate of delicious cookies shaped like fish .
All the children , even in Berkley , love cookies and hate broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was taste some food from every dish .
And he pretends to love him or to hate him .
Half the time , it did as if the cookies liked it and didn &apos;t like broccoli — like a child or any normal person .
But the other half of the time , he &apos;d take some broccoli and he &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Mmmm , broccoli .
I tasted broccoli . Mmmm . &quot; &quot; And then he &apos;d take some biscuits , and he &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Puah , cookies .
I tasted the cookies . Puah . &quot; &quot; It was like he wanted the exact opposite of what the kids want .
We did it with 15 and 18 months old .
And then he just put his hand out and said , &quot; Do you give me some ? &quot;
The question is , what will the baby give her , what she likes to him or what she likes ?
And the amazing thing is that 18 months old , who barely walk and talk , give them cookies if they like cookies , but give them broccoli if they like broccoli .
On the other hand , 15-month-old kids stared at it long if it was acting as if they liked broccoli , as if they couldn &apos;t figure out why .
But after staring at her for a long time , they gave her the cookies , what they thought she would like everyone to enjoy .
There are two really remarkable things .
The first is that these 18-month-old children have already discovered this very profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same things .
And also , they felt they had to do something to help others get what they want .
And even more remarkable , the fact that a 15-month-old child did not make it suggests that these 18-month-old children have learned this profound fact about human nature in those three months from 15 to 18 months .
So kids know more and learn more than we can think .
And this is just one of the hundreds and hundreds of studies done in the last 20 years that demonstrate this .
The question you might ask is , why do children learn so much ?
And how do they learn so much in so short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at kids in a superficial way , they look pretty useless .
And in fact , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put time and energy just to keep them alive .
But looking at evolution looking for an answer to this mystery of why we spend so much time caring for useless children , it turns out that actually there &apos;s an answer .
And when you look at many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but you include other mammals , birds , even marsupials like cancers and vombatids , you find that there &apos;s a relationship between the length of childhood of a species and the size of their brain compared to the body and how smart and adaptable they are .
And for this idea , these birds are representative .
On the one hand , there &apos;s a rope from New Caledonia .
And the ropes and other bruises , ropes , cornacks and so on , are incredibly intelligent birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some cases .
And this is a bird on the cover of Science who learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our domestic chicken friends .
And the chickens , the ducks , the geese and the heels are essentially stupid .
So they &apos;re very , very good at catching the seeds , and they &apos;re not very good at doing anything else .
And it turns out that the puppets , the little baby in the New Caledonia rope , are birds .
They depend on their mom who drops their worms in the open beak for two years , which represents a very long time in a bird &apos;s life .
And the chickens are actually mature in a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason that the corals end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
What kind of explanation could we have ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem to be suitable to do one very good thing .
So they seem to be absolutely suitable to catch the feed in one environment .
Other creatures , like ropes , are not very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning the laws that govern different environments .
And of course , we humans are at the end of the distribution curve like chores .
We have bigger brains in proportion to the bodies much bigger than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more adaptable , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated around the world , and we &apos;ve also gone into space .
And our babies and children depend on us for a lot more time than any other species .
My son is 23 years old .
( Laughter ) And at least up to 23 years , we still lay the maggots in those little open mouths .
Why do we see this correlation ?
One idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is extremely powerful , great strategy to move forward in the world , but has a huge disadvantage .
And the great disadvantage is that , until you finish all that learning , you &apos;re impotent .
So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon that charges you as you say to yourself , &quot; A catapult or maybe a lanet might work . What &apos;s the best solution ? &quot;
You want to know everything before the mastodon shows up .
And the way evolution seems to have solved the problem is with a kind of task division .
The idea is that in this first time when we &apos;re totally protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all of these things that we &apos;ve learned from babies and children and put them working to go out there in the world .
One way to see it is that babies and small children are like division and development of the human species .
They are the protected scientists who only need to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we are the production and marketing .
We need to take all these ideas that we &apos;ve learned from children and implement them .
Another way of looking at it is , instead of thinking about babies and children as defective adults , we should look at them as human beings of the same species in a different phase of development — like with bruises and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the wonderful butterflies that go out in the garden and explore , and we are the bruises that slowly slowly raise the narrow path of adults .
If this is true , if these children are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story tells us that children are designed to learn , are made for this — we might expect them to have powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the children &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful computer that can learn on Earth .
But real computers are getting better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution recently in our understanding of machine learning .
And it depends on the ideas of this man , the Reverby Thomas Bayes , a statistic and mathematician of the 18th century .
And basically what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical method that uses probability theory to characterize and describe the way scientists discover the world .
What scientists do is they start with a hypothesis that they think is a starting point .
They test it .
The evidence gives them a change in hypotheses .
Then they test these new hypotheses and so on .
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical tool to do all this .
And that mathematics is at the heart of the best machine learning programs we have today .
And about a decade ago , I suggested that children could do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on behind those beautiful beavans , I think it looks like something like this .
These are the notes of the Revering Bayes .
I think these kids are actually doing complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that are going through to understand how the world works .
Well , it might seem even more difficult to prove .
Because after all , even if you ask adults about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How can children be good at statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine called Rilevator Blicket .
It &apos;s a box that &apos;s illuminating and it &apos;s playing by putting some things on it and not other things on it .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done a dozen studies showing how good kids are to learn about the world .
I &apos;ll just tell you one that we did with Tumar Kushner , a student of mine .
If I showed you this detector , it &apos;s likely that you would think , to start with , that the way to do it would be to put a block at the top of the detector .
But actually , this detector works a little bit odd .
Because if you pass a blockage at the top of the detector , something you would never have thought of starting with , actually the detector will be two times in three .
Whereas if you do the same thing , put the block on the detector , it will only live twice on six .
So the most unlikely hypothesis actually has more evidence for it .
It seems that shaking the object is a more effective strategy than the other .
We just did this : we gave a four-year-old this series of evidence , and we asked him to make it work .
And in fact , the four-year-old has used the evidence to act the object on the detector .
There are two very interesting things about this .
The first , again , remember , these are four-year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these rather complicated calculations that will give them a measure of the likelihood that they have .
And the other interesting thing is that they use the evidence to get an idea , to get to a hypothesis about the world , which seems to be very unlikely .
And in the studies that we &apos;ve just done in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve shown that four-year-olds are more good at coming up with an unlikely hypothesis than adults that we do exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , children use statistics to discover the world , but after all , scientists do experiments , and we wanted to see if children do experiments .
When kids do experiments , we call it &quot; &quot; try everything , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And recently there was a series of interesting studies that showed that play is really a kind of experimental research program .
This is one from the lab at Legare Christine .
What Christine did was use the Blicket Rilever .
And what he did was he showed the kids that the yellow would let him go and the red didn &apos;t , and then he showed an anomaly .
And what you &apos;re going to see is that this kid will experience five hypotheses within two minutes .
( Video ) Child : What do you think about this ?
Like on the other hand .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , his first hypothesis was contradicted .
Child : Nothing ( Laughter ) Child : This one &apos;s on , and this one &apos;s not .
AG : Okay , he took out the block of experiments .
Child : What is it that makes it light ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : All scientists recognize that expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , that &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
AG : Okay , second hypothesis .
Child : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG : So here &apos;s the next idea .
He told the experimenter to do that , to try to put it in the other place .
It doesn &apos;t even work that way .
Child : Oh , because light is just here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electric current , this one doesn &apos;t have it .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Child : You turn on .
So it &apos;s when you put four of them .
So you put four on this to make it light and two on this to make it light .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s the fifth guess .
This is a child — it &apos;s a particularly lovely , eloquent kid , but what Christine discovered is that it &apos;s actually quite characteristic .
If you look at how kids play , when you ask them to explain something , what they actually do is a series of experiments .
It &apos;s pretty typical of four-year-olds .
Well , what does this kind of creature mean ?
What does it mean to be one of these brilliant butterflies that can experience five hypotheses in two minutes ?
If you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , many of them said that babies and children are barely conscious if not entirely unconscious .
And I think it &apos;s all the other way around .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we as adults .
Here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And the attention and the consciousness of adults is a little bit like a reflector .
What happens in adults is that if we decide that something is relevant or important , we should be paying attention .
Our consciousness of that thing that we witness becomes extremely vivid and brilliant , and everything else is dark .
And we also know something about how the brain works this way .
What happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the part that goes out in our brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain a little bit more flexible , more plastic , more adapted to learning , and spends the activity throughout the rest of our brain .
So we have a very focused , focused attention driven by purpose .
If we look at babies and baby babies , we see something very different .
I believe that babies and small children have more of a lantern of consciousness than a reflector of consciousness .
So baby babies and baby babies are really bad at focusing on one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at collecting so much information from so many different sources at once .
If you look inside their brain , you can see that they &apos;re invaded by these neurotransmitters that are great for inducing learning and plasticity , and the parts that inhibit them are still not there .
So when we say that babies and baby children are not good at paying attention , what we actually mean is they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
They &apos;re not able to get rid of all the interesting things that might mean something to them and just look at what &apos;s important .
It &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies that are designed to learn .
Well , if we want to think about a way to have an idea of consciousness of an adult child , I think the best thing to do is to think of cases where we &apos;re in a new situation we &apos;ve never seen before — when we fall in love with somebody , when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , in fact it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem much more full of awareness and experience of all the months I spent walking , talking , resigning meetings like zombie and coming home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you drink at the bottom floor , actually simulates the effect of the neurotransmitters of the children .
So what does it mean to be a child ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after drinking three dopamine expressions .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it doesn &apos;t usually make you stand up at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s nice to be adults .
I don &apos;t mean too much about how wonderful kids are .
It &apos;s nice to be adults .
We can do things like chasing shoes and crossing the street alone .
And it makes a lot of effort to make kids think like adults .
But if what we want is to be like these butterflies , having open-minded mentality , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe sometimes we should push adults to start thinking about how babies are .

I &apos;m going to share with you the story of how I became an activist for the fight against HIV / AIDS .
This is the name of my campaign , SING .
In November 2003 , I was invited to participate in the opening of the 4664 Foundation by Nelson Mandela , and that &apos;s his foundation for HIV / AIDS struggle .
Whereas 4664 is Mandela &apos;s number of identifications during his prison in Robben Island .
That &apos;s me , with Youssou NDour on stage , having a lot of fun to die .
The next day , all artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he would give a world press conference in front of the cell where he was held .
You see the bars in the window .
It was for all an epocal moment .
At that moment , Mandela told the world press that a virtual genocide was going on in his country , in that Rainbow Nation of the after apartheid . He said that they were dying a thousand people a day , and that the victims on the front lines , the most vulnerable , were women and children .
The impact on me was huge , because I &apos;m a woman and a mother , and I didn &apos;t realize that HIV / AIDS pandemic affected women in such a way .
That &apos;s when I got busy — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; This is a topic I have to talk about .
I have to give my contribution . &quot; &quot; And since then , I &apos;ve been part of each of the events of 4664 that I could participate in , I &apos;ve given press conferences , I &apos;ve been releasing interviews , talking and using my music space , with my commitment to Mandela , which is held by respect for the amazing , incredible work that he did .
Everybody in the world respects Nelson Mandela . Everybody admires Nelson Mandela .
But are they all aware of what &apos;s happening in South Africa , in its country , the country that has had one of the highest transmission rates of the virus ?
If I went to the streets , now , telling people what was going on there , they would all be shocked .
I think I &apos;m very lucky to have met , a couple of years later , Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an activist and an incredible campaigner .
I met him at a 4664 event .
He wore a t-shirt like I have now .
This is a tool . It tells you that I am sympathetic with people with HIV , living with HIV .
In that way , despite the stigma , wearing this t-shirt , I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about it .
It doesn &apos;t have to be a taboo . &quot; &quot; I became a member of the Treatment Action Campaign , and I &apos;m very proud to be part of that beautiful organization .
It &apos;s a popular movement , and 80 percent of the members are women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
These women work in the fields .
And they have the great opportunity to reach people who are directly suffering from the effects of the virus .
They have education programs .
They controlled the stigma question .
What they do is extraordinary .
And yes , my SING Campaign supported the Treatment Action Campaign trying to increase awareness and also try to raise money .
Many of the funds I &apos;ve been able to raise have gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work they do , and they continue to do in South Africa .
So , this is my SING Campaign .
Basically SING Campaign is me and about three or four wonderful people supporting me .
I &apos;ve been traveling around the world for the last two and a half years , and I &apos;ve been visiting about 12 different countries .
Here I &apos;m in Norway , Oslo , getting a beautiful , substantial check . This is singing in Hong Kong , to support fundraising .
In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play for a mainly white audience in South African middle class who found themselves in tears because I showed them videos that touched their heart , and the real nature of this terrible tragedy that &apos;s happening , that people tend to avoid because they &apos;re tired , and they don &apos;t know what the solutions are .
Aaron Motsoaledi , the minister of current health , participated in the concert , and I met him , and he confirmed me the total commitment to try to bring change , which is absolutely necessary .
This is in Scottish Parliament .
And then I became an invitation for Scotland and HIV .
And I told them my experiences , looking for , again , to raise them .
And again , in Edinburgh , with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir , which I love .
And it &apos;s children like them , many who are left orphans because of the families affected by the AIDS virus .
Here I am in New York with Michael Sidibe , the director of UNAIDS .
I &apos;m very honored that Michel invited me , just a few months ago , to become the UNAIDS ambassador .
So I strengthened my platform and expanded my boundaries .
The message that UNAIDS is currently sending to the world says we want to see the potential elimination of mother &apos;s transmission to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we believe it &apos;s achievable with political will .
It can be done .
Here I am with a pregnant , HIV-positive woman , and we &apos;re both smiling because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is getting the care that she needs to extend her life so that she can take care of the child she &apos;s going to be born .
And her baby will get PMTCT , and that means that that child will not be born with the virus .
It &apos;s about prevention from the beginning of life .
And it &apos;s a way to start interacting with the pandemic of AIDS .
Now I &apos;d like to conclude by telling you the short story of Avelile .
This is Avelile . It &apos;s with me everywhere I go .
I tell all of her story because she represents one of the millions of orphans of HIV / AIDS .
Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV viron , and she died of AIDS related diseases .
Avelile was infected with the virus . She was born with the virus .
Here we see it at age seven . It doesn &apos;t weigh more than a year-olds .
At this point in his life , he &apos;s infected with AIDS conclamed , and he has pneumonia .
We met her at the Eastern Cape hospital and spent the whole afternoon this lovely little girl .
Doctors and nurses have been phenomenal .
They put it on a very particular nutrition diet , and they took care of her .
And when we left the hospital — because we filmed his story — we didn &apos;t know if he would survive .
Obviously — it was a huge emotional meeting , and it was very touched by us , because of the direct experience with this little girl , you know , with her story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
And I feel — I have brivids — I don &apos;t know if you can see my goosebumps .
I have goosebumps because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transformation that happened .
Isn &apos;t that amazing ?
( Applause ) These applause really are for doctors and nurses at the hospital who took care of Avenile .
And I think you can understand that you will pass this transformation .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , every single one of you in the audience , if you believe that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good health care , and if you believe that the Millennium Development Goals in particular five and six , they absolutely must have the commitment to all the governments in the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa , you might stand up .
I think it &apos;s fair to say that they &apos;re almost all in the room .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago , in the former Soviet Union , a team of engineers stepped a large object through a desolate campaign .
With that object , they hoped to capture the world &apos;s attention by conquering space for first .
The rocket was huge .
And slammed into his nose was a silver ball with two radio antennae , and stuck in his nose a silver ball with two radio antennae .
On October 4th of 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote , at that time , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to create a new planet , which we &apos;re going to call Sputnik . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to create a new planet , which we &apos;re going to call Sputnik .
In the past , explorers like Vasco de Gama or Colombo Cristophorus in the past , explorers like Vasco de Gama or Colombo Cristophus were fortunate enough to discover the Earth &apos;s globe .
Now we are lucky enough to conquer space , and in the future they will send us .
Now we have the fortune to conquer space , and in the future they will send us . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re seeing pictures of Sputnik , my fifth documentary , which is basically completed . It tells the story of &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; and what I &apos;m going to get out of it .
It &apos;s almost completed . It tells the story of &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; and what you think of it , which is basically completed . It tells the story of &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; and what I &apos;m going to get .
For days and days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity . For days and days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
A artificial moon , visible by ordinary citizens , inspired pride and fear for the fact that humans had finally launched an object in space .
But only three days later , one day called The Lunesday Red , the media and politicians told us , and we believed it , that Sputnik was the demonstration of the media and politicians told us , and we believed it , that Sputnik was the demonstration that our enemy had beat us in science and technology that our enemies beat us in science and technology and that they could now attack us on fire on a planet of the planet Earth .
It was a moment of general panic .
Sputnik soon became one of the three great shocks that hit America — historians compare it to Pearl Harbor and 9 / 11 .
He stimulated the production of missiles , the race to space , and arms .
He stimulated the production of missiles , the race to space , and arms .
He stimulated the production of missiles , the race to space , and arms .
Within a year , Congress greatly increased gun funding and went from 1200 to 20,000 nuclear weapons , and we went from 1200 to 20,000 nuclear weapons .
But Sputnik reactions went much further .
For example , some of you may remember this day , June 1958 , for example , some of you may remember this day , June 1958 , the day of the Civil Desert , when tens of millions of people , in 78 cities , fell underground .
Or the Gallup poll that showed that seven out of 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and at least 50 percent of our population would have been killed , and at least 50 percent of our population would have been killed .
But Sputnik also promised a lot of positive changes .
Some of us got an education through Sputnik , some of us got an education through Sputnik .
The support of engineering , mathematics and science , and education in general , exploded .
Vint Cerf makes it clear how Sputnik directly led to ARPA , and the Internet , and of course NASA directly led to ARPA , and the Internet , and of course NASA .
My documentary shows how media agreements can instillate fear in a free society , my documentary shows how media recognition can instillate fear in a free society .
But it also shows how we can transform what seems like a negative start into something that was overall positive for America .
Sputnik will come out soon .
In closing , I &apos;d like to take advantage of it to thank one of my investors , in closing , I &apos;d like to take advantage of this to thank one of my investors , the long-standing TEDster Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank all of you .

Thank you , Chris .
Good morning . Magic is a wonderful way to stand above the curve of reality , to make possible today what science will transform tomorrow .
As a cyber magician , they combine elements of illusion and science to give us a sense of what future technologies will do to us .
You &apos;ve probably all heard of the glasses of the Google Glass project .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look at it through and the world that you see is integrated by data : names of places , monuments , buildings , someday even the names of the strangers you meet on the street .
These are my illusions glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . It &apos;s a prototype .
When you look through it , look into the mind of a cyberillusionist .
Let me show you what I mean .
We just need a play card . Any card is fine .
Like this . I teach it so that we can recognize it when we see it again .
All right . A very visible sign .
We put it in the deck , somewhere , and we start .
( Music ) Voice : The system is ready . Imagination is going on .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made of four seeds : hearts , flowers , paintings and spades .
These cards are among the oldest symbols , and they &apos;ve been played in many different ways .
Some people say the four seeds represent the four seasons .
There &apos;s the spring , the summer , the fall and — Voice : My favorite season is winter . MT : Well , yes , my own .
The winter is magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when the heat gets cold , the water turns into snow , and then everything goes away .
There are 13 cards for each seed . ( Music ) Voice : Every card represents one of the 13 stages of the lunar cycle .
MT : Here we have the low sea , and here &apos;s the high tide , and in the middle there &apos;s the moon .
Voice : The moon is one of the strongest symbols of magic .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
There &apos;s the red color and the black color that represent constant change from day to night .
Voice : Marco , I didn &apos;t know I could do something like this . ( Laughter ) MT : And it &apos;s a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just like there are 52 weeks in a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you add all the points in a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in one year , the number of days in one birthday and another .
Spread a wish . ( Sound noises ) Voice : Don &apos;t unveil it otherwise , it doesn &apos;t happen .
MT : Well , actually , I got my first card deck the day of my sixth birthday , and from that day , I traveled around the world doing magies for children and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even king and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , a rule . Look .
Wake up .
Jolly : Oau . MT : Are you ready for the party ?
Jolly : Hello ! MT : Let &apos;s see what you can do .
Jolly : I &apos;ll introduce you to my stick . MT : Ah . Listen .
Jolly : Uah , uah , uah , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I &apos;m performing myself for a different kind of audience .
I &apos;m performing for you .
Voice : Chapter being detected . MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how you get magician . Is it a full-time job ?
Absolutely not ! You have to practice 24 hours , seven days .
I don &apos;t mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
It &apos;s a little exaggeration , but it takes practice . Somebody will say magic must be a job for some diabolic , over-natural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Uah .
Well , to that , I say no , no .
In fact , in Germany , it &apos;s called nein , nein . ( Laughter ) Magic is not that challenging . I have to warn you , but if you play cards with someone who manages cards like this , don &apos;t play money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a good hand .
The likelihood of having it is 4165 to one .
MT : Yeah , but I think my hand is better . We estimate the odds .
Voice : I think you &apos;ve made your wish . MT : And that leaves me the last and most important paper : that with this very significant sign .
And contrary to everything we just saw , virtual or less . Voice : identified Charter .
Digital MT : This is definitely true .
MT : Hi , hi . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I worked at MIT for 44 years . I attended the first TED edition .
The third question is a little less obvious .
All right ? No , not entirely .
I buy . I have a lot of that money .
I have so much money that it would take me forever to spend them .
I grew up in Bihar , the poorest state in India , and I remember when I was six years old , coming home one day and finding a cart on the door filled with delicious sweetlands .
My brother and I were thrown away , and then my father came home .
It was furious , I still remember how crying we cried when the cart with sweetlands for half eaten was taken away .
I later realized why my father was angry .
Those sweetlands were a bribe from a contractor trying to push my father to give him a statistical contract .
My father was building roads in Bihar , and he was firmly opposed to corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
It was a solitary battle , because Bihar was also the state of India that was most corrupt , where official public got rich , instead of serving the poor who had no means to express their angst if their children had no food or education .
I &apos;ve lived it viscerally , traveling to remote villages to study poverty .
When I went to village , I remember one day , I was hungry and exhausted , I was almost collapsing under a tree in a hot torrido , and right at that moment , one of the poorest men in the village invited me to his shack and kindly gave me to eat .
Only after that , I realized that what he gave me was food for two days for his whole family .
This profound generosity challenged me and changed the purpose of my life .
I decided to give back .
Later , I joined the World Bank , trying to fight this poverty by transferring aid from rich countries to poor countries .
I first worked in Uganda , where I focused on reform negotiation with the Minister of Finance in Uganda because they could access our loans .
But after giving loans , I remember a trip to Uganda where he found newly constructed schools without textbooks and teachers , new clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without voice or aid .
It was again like Bihar .
Bihar is the development challenge : miserable poverty surrounded by corruption .
On a global level , 1.3 billion people live with less than 1.25 dollars a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that had been implemented since 1944 , when the winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and a single , founding mother , came together in New Hampshire , the United States , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
And that traditional approach to development had three key elements : First , the transfer of resources from the rich North countries to the poorest countries in the South , accompanied by reform indications .
Secondly , the development institutions that convey these transfer were opaque , untransparent about what they funded or what they achieved .
And third , engagement in developing countries was established with a government recipe with little interaction with citizens , which are the final beneficiaries of development assistance .
Today , each of these elements is opening up because of radical change in the global environment .
Open knowledge , open aid , open authority , and together , represent the key changes that are transforming development and giving great hope to the problems I &apos;ve seen in Uganda and Bihar .
The first key change is open knowledge .
The developing world today will not just accept second-hand solutions from the United States , Europe or the World Bank .
They take inspiration , hope , and practical skills , from the emerging economies of South Africa .
They want to know how China has evoked from poverty 500 million people in 30 years , like the Oportunidades program in Mexico has improved schooling and nutrition of millions of children .
This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows , not just transfer from North to South , but from South to South , even from South to North , with the Mexican Oportunidades program that now inspires the city of New York .
And just like these transfer from North to South are opening up , the same is the development institutions that convey these transfer .
This is the second change : open aid .
Recently , the World Bank opened its public usage bank , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators of 200 countries over 50 years and launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative applications using this data .
The development institutions are also opening public exam to the projects that fund .
Take GeoMapping . In this map of Kenya , the red dots show the position of schools funded by donors , and the more the green area is , the more the children who finished school .
This simple combination reveals that donors have not funded schools in areas with the most unequal number of children in school , generating new questions . Development assistance is addressed to those who need help ?
In this way , the World Bank has now mapped 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and donors use a common platform to map their projects .
This is a tremendous step forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
From my perspective , this leads to the third and most significant change in development : open authorities . Today governments are opening up as citizens demand listening and accountability .
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , they use mobile phones and social media not just for political reasons but also for development responsibility .
Are governments providing services to citizens ?
For example , different governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening up their budget to the public .
But there &apos;s a big difference between a public budget and an affordable budget .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) As you can see , it &apos;s not really affordable or understandable for a normal citizen who &apos;s trying to figure out how the government spends its resources .
To deal with this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget more understandable to the public .
In this map of Moldovia , green color shows those regions that have limited expenditure in schools but good educational outcomes and red color shows the opposite .
Odds like this help transform a shelf full of unintelligible documents into a publicly understandable view , what &apos;s great is that with this openness , there are now new opportunities for citizens to resist government and engage with it .
Today in the Philippines , parents and students can give real time feedback on the site Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , if at school they &apos;re in textbooks and professors , the same problems that I saw in Uganda and Bihar .
Government is receptive . For example , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repair had stopped because of corruption , the Department of the Philippines Education instantly .
And you know what &apos;s wonderful about this : this innovation is spreading from South to South , from Philippines to Indonesia to Kenya , Moldovia and beyond .
In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even a very poor community has been able to use these tools to voice their desires .
This is the map of Tandal in August 2011 , but within a few weeks , college students were able to use cell phones and an open platform to completely map the entire infrastructure of the community .
What &apos;s amazing is that citizens were then able to reshape the points of water or health that didn &apos;t work , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provide a graphic visualization of the collective voices of poverty .
Today , Bihar is changing and is opening up with a dedicated leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and reactive to the poor .
But in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or serving the poor , and it &apos;s a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are solitary warriors like my father and many others , and a key frontier of the work on development is to help these solitary warriors unite efforts so that they can overcome adversity .
For example , today in Ghana of the brave civil society reformers , parliament and government , have created a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil industry and galvanized by this , the parliament reformers are now investigating suspicious contracts .
These examples give a new hope , new possibilities to the problems that I witnessed in Uganda or my father confronted in Bihar .
Two years ago , on April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was late at night , and at 80 , he was writing a reverse public interest of 70 pages against corruption on a road project .
Even though he was not a lawyer , he supported the case alone in court the next day , the judge was right , but that same night , he fell and died .
He reached the end , increasingly convinced that in order to fight corruption and poverty , not only did government have to be honest , but citizens had to come together to make their voices heard .
These became the two columns of his life , and the journey he took in the middle reflected the change of the landscape of development .
Today , I &apos;m enlightened by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank we &apos;re taking these new directions , a significant distinction from my work in Uganda in 20 years .
We need to radically open development so that knowledge flows in different directions , whether it &apos;s inspiration for professionals , so that aid will become transparent , accountable and effective , so that governments open up and citizens are involved and responsible for reformers in governments .
We need to accelerate these changes .
In doing that , we will discover that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , Uganda and beyond .
We will find that the textbooks and teachers will be present in school for their children .
We &apos;ll find that these children also have a real chance to get out of poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Imagine an airplane that &apos;s about to crash with 250 kids and children , and if you knew how to stop it , would you do that ?
Imagine 60 planes full of children under five years crashing every day .
It &apos;s the number of children who don &apos;t get to the fifth birthday .
Sixty-six million children don &apos;t get to five .
Most of these deaths are preventable , and that &apos;s not only makes me sad , it makes me angry and it makes me determined .
Diarrhea and pneumonia are the two main causes of death of children under the age of five , and we can avoid these diseases not by some new intelligent technology .
But through one of the oldest inventions : soap .
Working with soap , a granted habit , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by a third .
Working with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , tracome , SARS , and recently in the case of cholera and the Ebola epidemic , one of the key interventions is washing your hands with soap .
Working with soap holds kids in school .
It teaches kids to die .
Working with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways to save children &apos;s lives .
It can save more than 2,000 children a year .
It &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo a day full of kids crashing .
I guess you &apos;ll agree that this is a useful public health care intervention .
Take a minute .
I think you have to know the person next to you .
Because you don &apos;t shake your hand .
Stringle your hand .
Well , know .
It &apos;s really cute .
All right .
And if I told you that the person you just shredded your hand didn &apos;t wash your hands after you went to the bathroom ? ( Laughter ) That &apos;s no more cute , right ?
That suck , you &apos;ll agree with me .
The statistics show that four out of five people don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the bathroom , globally .
In the same way , we don &apos;t do it in good bathrooms , with current water , knowing at the disposal , is the same in countries where child mortality is very high .
What is it ? Is there no soap ?
The soap is actually there .
In 90 percent of homes in India , 94 percent of homes in Kenya , you &apos;ll find soap .
Even in countries where there &apos;s little soap , like Ethiopia , we &apos;re 50 percent .
So why ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
Why Mayank , the guy I met in India , don &apos;t you wash your hands ?
In the Mayank family , the soap is used to bathe , to make the laundry , the soap is used to wash the dishes .
Parents sometimes think it &apos;s a precious asset , so they keep it in the closet .
They keep it out of their scale because it &apos;s not going to be wasted .
On average , in Mayank &apos;s family , they use soap to wash their hands once a day in the best guess , and sometimes even once a week .
What are the consequences ?
Children take diseases in the place where more should be loved and protected , at home .
Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn in school ?
I think behavior experts will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change acquired habits .
However , we all copy what other people do , and local cultural norms affect our behavior , and that &apos;s where the private sector comes in .
In Asia and Africa , every second 111 mothers buy this soap to protect their family .
Many women in India will tell you that they learned everything about hygiene , disease , from this soap of Lifebuoy brand .
representative brands have the responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
It &apos;s this belief , plus the Unilever dimension , that allows us to continue talking about washing our hands with soap and hygiene for these mothers .
Big companies and brands can change , change these social norms and make a difference for these very resistant habits .
Think about it : marketing is constantly trying to get us from one brand to another .
And it knows how to transform science and facts into convincing messages .
Just for a minute , imagine when they take out the force behind a powerful message about washing their hands with soap .
The profit movement transforms health into this world .
It &apos;s been happening for centuries : the March Lifebuoy was launched in 1894 during Victorian England to counter the cholera .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the Minister of Health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s an epidemic of cholera in Ghana right now .
118 years later , the solution is exactly the same : it &apos;s about making sure they have access to this soap and they use it , because it &apos;s the first solution to stop the spread of cholera .
I think the profit movement is very strong , sometimes stronger than the most challenging charity or the government .
Government does what can , especially for pandemics and epidemics like cholera , or Ebola right now , but with conflicting priorities .
The budget isn &apos;t always there .
Think about what it takes to wash your hands into a daily habit , you need continuous funds to deal with behavior .
In short , those who fight for public health depend on soap companies to continue promoting their hands with soap .
We have friends like USAID , Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing in Soap , London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , Plan , WaterAid , who all believe in a winning collaboration for everyone .
Vincent for the public sector , because we help them achieve goals .
Vincent for the private sector , because we build new generations of clean hands .
And most of all , winning for the most vulnerable .
On October 15th , we will celebrate the national day of clean hands .
Scubicles , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — and on that day also our competitors — we &apos;ll all join in celebrating the most important public health intervention in the world .
What it takes , and again , where the private sector can make a huge difference , is to come up with the creative thought that leads to support .
If you take our Help campaign in Child Reach 5 , we &apos;ve made great videos that bring the message of washing your hands with soap to the common people intuitively .
We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
Most of the arguments are still going on .
I urge you to spend five minutes watching these videos .
I come from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
I grew up in a family where every conversation at the table was about social justice .
I grew up in primary European schools for public health .
I think I &apos;m one of the few women in my country with this qualification and the only one with a Ph.D. in washing their hands with soap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , with a public health career in training , I decided that I could have a significant impact , selling and promoting the best invention of the world for public health : soap .
Today we run the washing program of the world &apos;s largest hands according to any standard of public health .
We &apos;ve reached 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambition to reach a billion by 2020 .
Over the last four years , the industry has grown to double digits , whereas child mortality has reduced to all the places where soap use has increased .
It might sound bad for some people to feel the growth of the industry and lives saved in the same sentence , but it &apos;s that growth that allows us to do more .
Without it , and without talking about it , we can &apos;t make the changes necessary .
Last week , my team and I went to visit mothers who all lived the same thing : the death of a baby .
I &apos;m a mom , I can &apos;t imagine anything stronger and more painful .
This is from Myanmar .
He had the best smile , the smile , I think , of life when he gives you a second chance .
His son , Myo , is his second son .
She had a three-week old daughter , and we know that most children dying , die during the first month of life , and we know that by giving a soap to every ostetric , and if the soap is used before we touch children , we can reduce those numbers .
This is what inspires me , and it forces me to continue on this mission , to know that I can bring them with the need for them to do the most beautiful work in the world : to grow a baby .
The next time you think about a gift for a baby and her family , don &apos;t look away : buy a soap .
It &apos;s the best invention of public health .
I hope you &apos;ll join us because washing your hands becomes part of your daily life and our daily life and you &apos;ll help other kids like Myo reach five .
Thank you .

These are simple objects : orologists , keys , bribes , glass .
These are things that the victims of the genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
We all know these mundane everyday objects well .
The fact that some victims brought personal objects like toothpaste and toothbrush is a clear signal that they had no idea what was going to happen to them .
Usually , they were told they would be exchanged with prisoners of war .
These objects have been reclaimed by numerous were common throughout the territory , and at this moment , forensic physicians are exhuming bodies that have just been discovered , 20 years after the war .
And it &apos;s probably the biggest one that &apos;s ever been discovered .
During the four years of the conflict that devastated Bosnia in the early 1990s , about 30,000 citizens , mostly civilians , disappeared , were supposed to be killed , and other 100,000 were killed during combat .
Most of them were killed in the early days of war or at the end of hostility , when the secure parts of the United Nations like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serbian army .
The international criminal court emitted many sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
genocide is the systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
Genocide means killing .
as much as it means to destroy property , cultural heritage , and basically the proof of their existence .
Genocide is not just about killing ; it &apos;s about denying identity .
There are always traces , perfect crime doesn &apos;t exist .
There are always remains of the dead that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and evanescent memory .
These objects are recovered by numerous were common , and the main goal of this collection of objects is a unique process of identifying those who have disappeared in those homicides , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust time .
All bodies need to be discovered and identified .
Once they recover , these things that the victims carry with them on the way of execution are carefully repulsed , analyzed , catalyzed and stored .
Thousands of waste are replaced in plastic bags like the ones you see in CSI .
These objects are used as punctuated tools for visual detection of victims , but they &apos;re also used as precious forestry in the process of war crimes going on .
The survivors are occasionally called to try to physically identify objects , but physical research is an extremely difficult , ineffective and painful process .
Once the legal doctors and lawyers ended up with these things , they become the storyteller orphans .
Most people are destroyed , believe it or not , or they &apos;re just archived , far from the eyes , far from the heart .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single object that was reversed to create a visual archive that survivors could easily consult .
As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
I like to go beyond consciousness .
In this case , someone could recognize these objects or at least photographs will remain as permanent , unbiased and accurate as what happened .
Photography is empathy , and the familiarity of these objects guarantees empathy .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a forensic physician , if you will , and the result is a photograph as close as possible to a document .
Once you identify all the disappeared people , they will only remain the bodies in decomposition in their grave and these everyday objects .
In their simplicity , these objects are the ultimate testament of victims &apos; identity , the last permanent memory that these people have existed .
Thank you very much .

It can &apos;t do well .
I prefer chocolate chambers .
So I &apos;d like to show you something that I &apos;m working on .
There are some things that I learned as I tried these 30-day challenges .
This is part of the goal of taking a picture a day for a month .
I would never have been so adventurous to do such a business .
It &apos;s bad .
In fact , I &apos;m a big deal of life .
( Applause )
Hi . I &apos;d like to talk to you today about some work that we carry on .
Because I &apos;m still working , we &apos;re still moving in the limits of intuition and mystery .
I &apos;m going to try to explain to you some of the experiences that we &apos;d like to do through every work .
The first job is called the Imperial Monocromes .
A viewer enters almost unexpectedly in the room , and he sees these panels displaced in a disorderly way on the wall .
After a few seconds , as if the panels had noticed the presence of the visitor , they seem to act and try to compose a perfect symmetry .
( Laughter ) This is the draft of the two situations .
One is complete chaos . The other is perfect order .
And we were interested in how a small change could lead from one state to another .
This also reminds us of two very different pictographic traditions .
On the one hand , the altitude pale of the 20th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , the abstract compositions of Malevich .
I &apos;d like to show you a video .
To give you an idea of scale , the largest panel is about two meters .
It &apos;s about that big . And the smallest one is like an A4 sheet .
The visitor gets to that area , and they &apos;re on the watch .
And after a while , if the visitor continues to stay in the area , the panels become more or less immune to the presence of the visitor and become again independent and disactive , until they perceive a presence in the room or a movement , coming back to the attention .
( Laughter ) It seems to be the visitor to submit the impression of order between the panels , but it might also be the opposite , which is that the panels are trapped in their executed behavior and attributed to the viewer the role of tyrant .
This brings me to a quieter , smaller job called Handled .
The viewer sees a piece of paper stared at a wall at the bottom , but when you approach it , you find that it &apos;s a white A4 sheet of paper , or a letter , which is smiled on either side of two small hands that seem to be sculpted by a strain of wood with a lot of caring and precision .
The visitor also notices that the entire sculpture has been moving very slowly , as if these two hands were trying to hold the paper up a long time , and somehow they &apos;re not succeeding .
So this prediction in motion looks a lot like the unstable nature of images seen through a camera by hand .
I &apos;m going to show you two videos in parallel .
One through a fixed camera and the other through a hand-held camera .
You &apos;ll notice immediately how unstable nature of the video involves the presence of a viewer and a subjective perspective .
So we removed the car and transferred the movement to the panel .
This is the video .
You have to imagine the other hand . There &apos;s not yet .
As far as we are , we &apos;re trying to reproduce an attitude of self-exclusion , as if there was a small person with their arms held behind this huge piece of paper .
It &apos;s as if we compared it to the amount of effort to the viewer &apos;s service and delicately presented this piece of paper to the visitor , in front of him .
The next job is Decoy .
It &apos;s a cardboard model , so the object is as high as I am .
It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very high antennas as a head , and its only purpose is to attract attention to itself .
When a visitor walks in front of him , he taps himself on one side to the other , and he shakes his hands faster and faster as the person gets closer .
Here &apos;s the first environment to test it .
You see the two integrated movements , and the object seems to use all its being to express despair .
But the idea is that once it attracted attention , it &apos;s no longer interested and it &apos;s already looking for the attention of another person .
( Laughter ) This is the final structure of Decoy .
It seems to be produced in series as if it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
Because we always work within a very personal space , we like the way the consumer aesthetics customize the object by giving us , at least apparently , a little bit away .
So for us , this is kind of a threat that tries to distract you from the things that you should really focus on , but it can also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
The next work is an object , which is also a kind of musical instrument .
In the form of anphitheater , it &apos;s reduced to the size that the audience is seen by the people on the stage .
Where I &apos;m from , each of you looks this big , and the audience somehow occupies all of my visual field .
Sitting in the audience is 996 little sagabs .
They &apos;re designed to mechanically applaud according to their will .
It means that each one of them can decide whether and when they apply , the intensity , the duration , how much to influence others or how to influence each other at once and their eventual contribution to innovation .
When the viewer is in front of the audience , there will be a reaction .
They can be slippery applause or fires , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and there &apos;s going to be a reaction from the audience again .
It could be anything , like a weak applause of some members of the audience , or even a crushing ovation .
As far as we &apos;re concerned , we &apos;re facing an audience as an object or an organism that also has qualities of musical type , like a tool .
The viewer can process , through a complex production , sound models or evanescent music models , but it can &apos;t submit into the audience a real , kind of reaction .
We find a sense of judgment , of unpredictability and agitation .
It also has an attractive , almost deceptive quality .
As you can see , we &apos;re all excited in front of these heads separating in two parts , forming hands .
Here &apos;s a little visual animation , as if the two parts of the brain coded against each other to create the sense of duality and tension .
Here &apos;s the prototype .
We can &apos;t wait to be invited by 96 animals .
This is the last job . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
It comes from the idea of window .
This is a real window in our office , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different wooden sections .
We used the same vocabulary of the window to build our canvas or reticole that &apos;s suspended in the room and can be seen from both sides .
This canvas is inhabited by a small figure tribe .
These are three different measures to give the idea of perspective or landscape on one plane .
Every figure can go back and forth along the binary and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
Unlike this weak , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and funny sense , as if he moved a puppeteer that physically guides them along the way .
We like the idea of these figures that bounce like they were unaware and susceptible and happy , until they don &apos;t understand a movement of the viewer and hide behind the nearest wall .
So this work for us also has a contradiction .
These figures appear trapped inside this rigid canvas , which looks like a prison , but also a fortress because it allows them to be unaware , ephemeral , enslaved and isolated from the outside world .
All of these qualities of real life that I &apos;m talking about are transferred to a particular technical configuration , and we were lucky to be able to collaborate with the ETH of Zurich to develop the first prototype .
As you can see , they extracted the moving gear from our animations and created a movement that integrated the head movement up and down and back and forth .
It &apos;s really small .
You can see it can be in the palm of my hand .
Imagine our joy when we actually saw it in the studio , and there it is .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
And I wanted to work this way .
This was the plan .
I had everything ready , but then , actually , the deadline came up and I did this .
( Laughter ) And it happened every single time .
And then , the time of the 90 page thesis , which you should work on one year .
I knew that for my thesis , my usual rhythm wasn &apos;t right .
The project was too long .
The year would have gone like this .
How hard can it be to scale ?
Those first months ?
So , I made a beautiful new plan .
( Laughter ) But then — ( Laughter ) Even those middle months went by , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and so I found myself here .
Then , two months became one , which became two weeks .
I thought that was it .
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , we &apos;ve got to talk about his thesis . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; That &apos;s the best we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s not true . ( Laughter )
The thesis was really bad . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy that moment when you all thought , &quot; This guy is great ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was really bad .
Anyway , I &apos;m a writer and blogger today .
I blog &quot; &quot; Wait and Why &quot; &quot; blog .
And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
My theory was that procrastinators &apos; brains were actually different than other people &apos;s brains .
To test it , I found a lab at RM that let me examine both my brain , whether it &apos;s a real non-procrastinator , so I could compare it to it .
I &apos;ve taken them here to show you today .
I &apos;m asking you to look at them carefully to see if you notice the difference .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both have a rational decision , but the procrastinator brain also has a monkey for immediate gratification .
What does this mean for a procrastinator ?
It means that everything is fine , until this happens .
&#91; Now it &apos;s the best time to work a little bit . &#93; &#91; No . &#93; So the decision is going to make a rational decision to make something productive , but the monkey doesn &apos;t like it , so he takes control and he says , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s run the whole page of Wikipedia on the scandal Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding , just because I &apos;ve just remembered it .
( Laughter ) &quot; It &apos;s going to take a while , &quot; &quot; so , there &apos;s really no time to work today .
Except . &quot; &quot; ( Screaming ) What &apos;s going on ?
The monkey doesn &apos;t seem to be the kind you want to have a rudder .
She lives entirely in the present .
She has no memory of the past and no conception of the future , and she only care about two things : the easy and the fun .
In the animal world , that &apos;s fine .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend all your life doing just easy and fun things , you &apos;re a success .
( Laughter ) And for Scimmy , humans are just an animal species .
You have to feed you , sleep and reproduce yourself in a new generation . That could be good at the time of tribes .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed that , we &apos;re not in tribes .
We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , but the monkey doesn &apos;t know what it is .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s someone else in the brain : rational decision , where we do things that other animals can &apos;t do .
We can imagine the future .
We can see the big picture .
We need to do long-term plans .
And he wants to be aware of this .
And it just wants us to do what makes sense to do right now .
Sometimes , it makes sense to do something easy and fun , like when you &apos;re at dinner or you go to sleep , or enjoy your free time deserve .
And there &apos;s a superposition .
Sometimes the two agree .
But other times , it makes a lot more sense to do things that are harder and less pleasant , because of the overall picture .
And that &apos;s where we have conflict .
And for the procrastinator , that conflict always ends in a certain way , allowing them to spend a lot of time in this orange zone , an easy and fun place outside the circle of what makes sense .
I call it the dark playground .
( Laughter ) The dark playground is a place that all of you procrastinators know very well .
It &apos;s where you do the entertainment business in those moments when you shouldn &apos;t .
The fun in the dark playground is not just fun , because it &apos;s not earned . In the air there &apos;s a sense of guilt , fear , anxiety , hatred for themselves — all feelings of good procrastinator .
And the question is , in this situation , with the monkey at the rudder , how does the procrastinator move here , in the blue area , a much less pleasant place , but where do you do the important things ?
Well , you have to know that the procrastinator has a janitor angel , someone who looks at it from the top and protects it in the hardest moments — somebody called the panic monster .
( Laughter ) For most of the time , the monster of the panic sleeping , but he wakes up all of a sudden , every time a deadline approaches , or there is danger of a public embarrassment , a workshake or some frightening consequence .
In my life , the monster showed up , quite recently , because about six months ago , TED staff contacted me and invited me to give a presentation .
( Laughter ) Of course I said yes .
I &apos;ve always dreamed of doing a TEDTalk before .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of the frenzy , the decision seemed to think about something else .
He said , &quot; &quot; Are we sure what we accepted ?
Do we understand what &apos;s going to happen someday in the future ?
We need to sit down and work on it now . And the monkey says , &quot; &quot; Completely agreed , but we open Google Earth , and we zoom in south of India , 60 meters above the surface , and we roll the page for two and a half hours until we get to the top of the country and we get an idea of India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
Six months became four , then two and then one , and the TED staff decided to post the names of the speakers .
I opened the site and there , there was my face looking at me .
And guess who woke up ?
( Laughter ) The panic monster begins to lose its head , and a few seconds later , all the system is in chaos . ( Laughter )
And the monkey — remember , he &apos;s afraid of the monster — go to the tree !
And finally , finally , the decision takes the command and and I can start working .
Now , the monster explains all kinds of strange behaviors of the procrastinator , like , how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to write the initial sentence of a relationship , and then miraculously finds the incredible work ethic to spend the night in white writing eight pages .
And all of this with the three characters — this is the procrastinator system .
It &apos;s not nice , but it works .
That &apos;s what I wanted to write about the blog a couple of years ago .
When I did , I was surprised by the reaction .
I literally got thousands of emails from all kinds of people , from all over the world , doing different things .
What struck me was the contrast between the allies of the article and the serious email .
I thought about it and I said , well , if the system works , then , where &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all unhappy ?
The fact is , there are two types of procrastrination .
All the examples I &apos;ve done today , they have deadlines , and if there are any deadlines .
If you want a career , where you &apos;re enterprising , for example in the arts , or being an entrepreneur , at first , there &apos;s no deadline , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve moved to start things .
Now , if for the procrastinator , the only way to do things is the monster , then there &apos;s a problem , because in all these situations without deadline , the monster doesn &apos;t show up .
And it &apos;s this kind of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and much less argued about the funniest , short-term , related to deadlines .
Generally it &apos;s suffering silently and privately .
And it can be the source of a great long-term granted , and regret .
And I thought , that &apos;s why all these people write me and that &apos;s why they &apos;re unhappy .
It &apos;s not that I &apos;m late with projects .
It &apos;s that long-term procrastination makes them feel like viewers , their lives , sometimes .
They were not frustrated because they didn &apos;t realize their dreams , but because they weren &apos;t even able to follow them .
So , I read the email and I had a little lighting — I mean , I don &apos;t think procrastinators exist .
Right . I think all of you are procrastinators .
You may not all be messed up , as some of us are , ( Laughter ) and some of you may even have a healthy relationship with deadlines , but remember , the most subtle joke in the monkey happens when there are no deadlines .
I want to show you one last thing .
I call it the calendar of life .
A box for every week of a life of 90 years .
It &apos;s not that many boxes , especially because we &apos;ve already used several of them .
I think we have to look carefully and long at this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastination about , because in life , each one of us is about something .
This is a task for all of us .
And because there aren &apos;t so many boxes , it &apos;s a task that maybe it should start today .
Well , maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) But ...
Soon .
Thank you .

There &apos;s a man named Captain William Swenson who was recently joined by the Library of Congress for his conduct on September 8 , 2009 .
That day , a column of American and Afghan troops were going through a region of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials who were supposed to meet with some elders in the village .
The column had a watermelon , and it was surrounded on three sides , and among other things , Captain Swenson was awarded for running in the open fire to save the wounds and recover the cadavers .
And the amazing thing about that day is that , for pure coincidence , one of the two doctors on the helicopter had a GoPro camera on the helmet and took the whole scene .
It shows Captain Swenson and his commiliton to carry a wounded soldier who had shot his neck .
They put it on the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bending forward and give it a kiss before you turn around and save other lives .
I saw the film , and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; Where do people come from ?
Why do they do that ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very , very deep emotion that drives one person to act like this .
There &apos;s love , and I wanted to know why people I work with are not made like this .
You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice for the good of others .
In the company , you give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others to benefit from them .
It works the opposite . Right ?
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial conclusion was that .
These people are attracted to the notion of service .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
What I &apos;ve learned is that it depends on the environment , and if you find the right environment , each of us has the ability to do these remarkable things , and most importantly , other people have it .
I had the great honor of knowing some of these people that we call heroes , who have endangered themselves and their lives to save other people &apos;s lives , and I asked them , &quot; Why would you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And everybody answered the same thing : &quot; Why would they do it for me ? &quot;
It &apos;s the deep sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are really important .
The problem with the concepts of trust and collaboration is that they are sensations , not instructions .
I can &apos;t just tell you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
I can &apos;t teach two people to cooperate , and they &apos;ll do it .
That &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic age , until the early years of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was full of dangers , the whole nature would put it all together to kill us .
Nothing personal .
Whether it was time , lack of resources , maybe a saber-tiger , all these natural elements were there to reduce the duration of our lives .
And so we evolved in social animals , living together and working together in what I call the safety circle , in the tribe , where we felt good .
And when we felt safe among our peers , the natural reaction was trust and collaboration .
These are benefits that characterize this condition .
It means that I can fall asleep at night and trust that some of my tribe will guard me .
If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , it means you &apos;re not going to be guard .
We had a survival system .
The modern age works exactly the same way .
The world is full of dangers , things that are trying to obstacle us and stop us from succeeding , reducing our possibilities to succeed .
They can be the highs and lows of the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
It can be a new technology that makes your business model obsolete from day to day .
Or it could be the competition that sometimes tries to kill you .
Sometimes it tries to exclude you from the business world , but as a minimum it tries to instantaneously stop you from growing and trying to steal your business .
We can &apos;t control those forces .
They &apos;re a constant and they &apos;re never going to disappear .
The only variable is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where leadership finds its importance because it &apos;s the leader who decides .
When a leader makes a choice to set out how to prioritize safety and life of people in the organization to sacrifice their own convenience in favor of tangible outcomes , so that people stay and feel secure and accepted , remarkable things happen .
I had to travel in an airplane , and I witnessed a scene where a passenger had tried to embarrass himself before his number was called , and I looked at the gate agent who treated that man as if he had broken the law , as a criminal .
He was blamed for trying to embark on a group before his own .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you treat us as animals ?
Why don &apos;t you treat us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And the agent responded to me exactly that .
He said , &quot; &quot; Lord , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could end up in trouble or lose the work . &quot; &quot; All he was communicating was that he didn &apos;t feel secure . Everything he was communicating to me .
It &apos;s that he doesn &apos;t trust his leaders .
The reason we fly with Southwest Airlines is not because they hire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
You see , if conditions are wrong , we are forced to expand our time and our energy to protect ourselves from others , and that makes the organization weak .
When we feel safe in the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our forces and work instantly to face the dangers outside and celebrate the opportunities .
The most pertinent analogy that comes to mind for a great leader , is a parent .
If you think about what it means to be a good parent , what do you want ? What does a parent do to a good parent ?
Our children want to provide opportunities , education , shout them if they need , all to grow them up and achieve important trips of what we &apos;ve achieved .
Great leaders want exactly the same things .
They want to give opportunities , education , test if necessary , claim self-esteem , give the opportunity to try and fail , all to get better outcomes than the ones they imagined themselves .
Charlie Kim , CEO of the Next Jump company in New York , a technology company , argues that if you were spending difficult moments in your family , would you ever consider the idea of licking one of your children ?
You would never do that .
So why do we consider the idea of licensing the staff into the company ?
Charlie has implemented a politics of employment for life .
If you &apos;re hired in Next Jump , you can &apos;t be fired for return issues .
In fact , if you have problems , they will teach you and give you support , just like we would do if one of our children leads home a bad school vote .
It &apos;s the exact opposite .
That &apos;s why so many people experience visceral hatred , anger , towards bankers who have salaries and bonus disproportionate .
It &apos;s not numbers .
It &apos;s the fact that we have violated the definition of leadership itself .
They have violated this deep-rooted contract in society .
We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so that they protect their interests , or worse , they sacrifice their people to protect their interests .
That &apos;s what offers us so much , not numbers .
Would someone offend if we gave a $ 150 million prize in Gandhi ?
And one of 250 million to Mother Teresa ?
Do we have any problems ? Nothing at all . Nothing at all .
Big leaders would never sacrifice .
People to save numbers .
They prefer to sacrifice numbers to save people .
Bob Chapman , who runs a great manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , 2008 was hit hard by the recession , and the company lost 30 percent of the orders from day to day .
Now , in a big manufacturing company , it &apos;s a tough hit , and they couldn &apos;t afford their employees anymore .
They had to save 10 million dollars , like so many other companies today , the advice came together and talked about fires .
And Bob refused .
You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in the number of people .
Bob believes in the number of hearts , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce the number of hearts .
And so they came up with a license program .
Every employee , from the secretary to the CEO , had to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
They could take them when they wanted , and they didn &apos;t have to take all four together .
But it was like Bob announced the program that matters .
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s better that all of us suffer a little bit rather than allowing some of us to suffer a lot , &quot; &quot; and the moral has displaced .
They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you would expect , when people feel secure and protected by leadership in society , the natural reaction is to trust and collaborate .
And almost spontaneously , no one would have said that , people started to agree with each other .
People who could afford more would trade with those who could afford less .
Some of them took five weeks so someone else could get three of them .
Leadership is a choice . It &apos;s not a rango .
I know a lot of people in the squares of companies who are not for any leader .
They are authority , and we do what they say because they have an authority on us , but we would never follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are at the lowest corporate levels that have no authority but are leaders all over the world , because they chose to take care of the person on their left , and they chose to take care of the person on their right .
That &apos;s who a leader is .
I heard a story about some Marines who were in theater and how he wants the Marines consumerism , the officer ate ate for the last , and he let his men eat for the first time , and when they finished , he wasn &apos;t advanced food for him .
And when they came back to the battlefield , his men took their food so that he could eat , because that &apos;s how things go .
We call them leaders because they go first .
We call them leaders because they take risks before anybody else .
They will give us blood , sweat and tears to see their vision of leaders become reality , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why do you get blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; And everyone said to me like , &quot; Why would they do the same thing for me ? &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the kind of company that we all want to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The most complex problems of our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we can dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to going from dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee who stood in the heart of the Andes .
I grew up like this : encouraged to see beyond any limit .
Part of my education included helping her in remote indigenous communities .
I love those memories because they helped me understand life out of the city ; a life with many possibilities , without barriers , like language or culture .
In those trips , my grandmother used to recite a poem by Kipling : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
He goes and looks beyond the mountains .
Something lost beyond mountains .
Lost wait for you . Okay ! &quot; &quot; Over the years I became a medical student .
One in a hundred children in the world are born with some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem that I think I can solve — the part of the problem that I worked on for a life .
The problem begins with pregnancy .
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
survival depends on communication between systemic blood and lung blood .
At the moment of birth , this communication has to break .
If you don &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
It &apos;s caused by genetic conditions and prematurities .
But what we know today is that one of the causes is also the lack of oxygen .
As you can see in the table , the frequency of this kind of hole increases dramatically with altitude .
Video : ( A child cries ) When you look at patients with this disease , it looks like they &apos;re desperately trying to breathe .
To close the hole , the only solution was high surgery .
One night , my friend Malte and I were camping in the Amazon .
The only thing that didn &apos;t burn in fire was a green branch of avocado .
Then , an inspiration came .
We used branch as a model for our first invention .
The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with that .
The spiral is a piece of wire wrapped up on itself .
It may not sound like a big deal right now , but that was our first attempt to create a device for this massive problem .
In this video , we can see how a very small catheter carries the spiral to the heart .
Then the spiral closes the hole .
After the moment of inspiration , it was a very long time of trial to develop a prototype .
The study in vitro and alive took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
The spiral , if it works , can save lives .
I went back to Bolivia from Germany , thinking , everywhere we go we have the opportunity to make a difference .
After successfully using our spiral on patients , we were really excited .
But we live in a place at 3,600 meters high .
And patients need a special device to solve their condition .
A hole in patients on the top is different , because the orphal between arteries is larger .
Many patients don &apos;t get treated in time and die .
The first spiral was able to solve the problem only half the patients in Bolivia .
The research began again .
We were point and boss .
After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends on the mountains , we got a new device .
We took this traditional textbook method and created a design made of a special material that memorizes the form .
This time it seems like tearing allows us to create a device without joints that doesn &apos;t ruin because it &apos;s made of one piece .
You can change it alone in very complex structures through a procedure that &apos;s been developed for decades .
As you can see , the device enters the body through natural channels .
Doctors just need to put the catheter through the hole .
Our device expands , it locks and closes the hole .
We have this very simple delivery system to use because it works alone .
You didn &apos;t need to open and operate .
( Applause ) We doctors fight disease that takes time and effort to heal — if they heal .
This is the first child , after the procedure .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is embedded , the patient is 100 percent healed .
At the beginning of the end , the whole process only takes 30 minutes .
It &apos;s very appealing from a medical and human perspective .
We are so proud that some of our old patients are part of our team — a team , because of the narrow interaction with the patients that work with us .
We all have the same idea : the solution has to be simple .
We &apos;ve lost the fear of creating something new .
The road is not easy .
Many obstacles are constantly emerging .
But we get the strength from our patients .
Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not for cost or for remoteness .
So we need to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
We &apos;re going to give a free device to ensure that every child is treated .
We are now in many countries , but we need to be everywhere .
All of this started with an impossible idea and it will continue , keep sure . No child will be left behind .
Muchas gracias .

I grew up in the Limpope , on the border between the Limpope and Mpumalanga , a small country called Motetema .
The supplies of water and electricity are unpredictable like time , and growing up in this difficult situation , at 17 years old , I was relaxing with a couple of friends in the winter , and we were taking the sun .
The Limpope sun is very hot in the winter .
As we were taking the sun , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t someone invent something to put on their skin so that they shouldn &apos;t have to wash ? &quot; &quot; I was sitting there and I said , &quot; &quot; I would buy it , you know ? &quot; &quot; I went back home , I did some research , and I found some staggering statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people around the world don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
450 million are in Africa , and five million are in South Africa .
Several diseases proliferate in this environment , the most drastic one is called tracome .
The tracome is an infection of the eye due to the dirt that goes into the eye . Ripetute tracome infections can make you blind .
These diseases permanently make eight million people every year , and the shocking thing is that in order to avoid being infected with traces , you just wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injection .
So , after seeing these disturbing statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I don &apos;t do that for me and for the fact that I don &apos;t want to get my toilet , I should at least try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , with my right desktop , my Nokia 6234 — I didn &apos;t have a computer and I didn &apos;t have the Internet , I only had a $ 20 café at the time — I did a piece of a graphic paper , and I did a lot of fusion press .
It looked like the secret spices of KFC , you know ?
I said , okay , the formula is ready .
Now you have to practice it .
Fast-forward four years , after writing a 40-page business plan on my cellphone , after writing my patent on my cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent owner in the country , and — ( No more toilet ) — I can &apos;t tell you more . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first prescription to the bathroom .
Literally , you put it on your skin and you don &apos;t need to bathe anymore .
( Laughter ) So after I tried to make it work at high school with limited resources , I went to college , I met a bunch of people , we did some evidence , and we have a product that &apos;s perfectly functional to put on the market . Now it &apos;s available on the market .
We learned a few lessons in commercialization , in making DryBath available .
One of the things we &apos;ve learned is that poor communities don &apos;t buy in large amounts .
They buy products on the basis of the question : A person like Alex doesn &apos;t buy a cigarette box . He buys a cigarette a day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged DryBath into these little , innovative little packets .
They bend in two , they crush .
And the nice thing is that a bag replaces a toilet for five rors .
By creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of product implementation .
We realized that even the rich kids in the peripheral neighborhoods wanted DryBath absolutely . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
However , we realized we could save 80 million gallons of water on average every time they replace a bathroom , and for a rural kid , they were saving two hours more to go to school , two hours more to devote their homework , two hours to just be a kid .
After seeing the global impact , we reduced it all to the main value proposition , which is cleaning and convenience .
DryBath is a convenience for rich men and saves their lives to poor people .
By experimenting with the product , we &apos;re now on the verge of selling it to multinational companies to bring it to detail , and one question I &apos;d like to ask the public today is , on the streets of the Limpopo , with a 50-rent paycheck a week , I discovered a way to avoid the world of bathroom .
And you ? What keeps you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not finished yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
Another key thing that I learned in all this process : last year Google selected me among the brightest young minds in the world .
I &apos;m also the best entrepreneur in the world right now , the first African to get that honorship , and the thing that makes me perplexed is that I did everything because I didn &apos;t want to go to the bathroom . Thank you .

Five years ago , I went to sabbatical geek , and I went back to medical school where I studied .
I visited patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , actually , since I became a corporate consultant .
Two things surprised me in that month .
The first was that the common theme of discussions were hospital budgets and cost cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , was that many colleagues I met , former medical colleges , who I knew were one of the smartest , most motivated , involved and passionate people I &apos;d never met , had become pregnant , welcome , and had taken the distances from the hospital administration .
With this attention to the cost cut , I wondered if we were not forgetting the patient .
Many of the countries that are represented and where I come from are struggling with health costs .
They represent a big piece of national budget .
And many different reforms among them are sometimes limiting this increase .
In some countries , there &apos;s a long time of waiting for surgery .
In other countries , new drugs are not repaid , and therefore they don &apos;t get to patients .
In many countries , doctors and nurses are , in a sense , the target of governments .
After all , health care decisions are taken by doctors and nurses .
You choose an expensive test , you choose to operate a fragile and old patient .
So limiting the degree of freedom of doctors is a way to contain cost .
Finally , today some doctors will say that they don &apos;t have full freedom of choice about what &apos;s best for their patients .
So it &apos;s not surprising that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
At Boston Consulting Group , we looked at this situation , and we said that it couldn &apos;t be the right way to manage health .
So we took a step back and we said , &quot; What are we trying to achieve ? &quot;
Eventually , in the healthcare system , we aim to improve patient health , and we need to do that at a limited or sustainable cost .
We call it value healthcare .
On the screen behind me , you can see what we mean by value : results that matter to patients in relation to spent money .
This concept was well explained in a book by 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
In this image , you see my mother-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
When we started our research at the BCG , we decided not to look at the costs too much , and to look at the quality , and in research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variations we saw .
Comparing hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find that some of them are good , but there are many who are far worse .
The difference was marked .
Erik , my mother-in-law , suffers from prostate cancer , and probably needs surgery .
Living in Europe , it can choose to go to Germany where the health care system is very high .
If it goes to Germany and chooses a hospital on average , it &apos;s going to take a 50 percent risk of becoming incontinent , so it should start using pannolone .
You release a coin . 50 percent risk . That &apos;s a lot .
If instead he went to Hamburg , in a clinic called Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only 20 percent .
Or you &apos;re launching a coin , or you &apos;re going to run 20 percent risk .
There &apos;s a big difference , seven times as much .
When you look at lots of hospitals for different diseases , you see huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
Often , the data doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
Going to the hospital is a lottery .
But it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
At the end of the 1970s , a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons gathered for the usual annual meeting , to discuss several procedures that were using in hip surgery .
On the left of this slide , you see an assortment of metal , even artificial , used for people who need a new hip .
Each one realized it had its own way to operate .
Everybody argued that their technique was the best , but actually no one was sure , and they loved it .
So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so that we know and learn from the best . &quot; &quot; So they spent two years discussing , &quot; What is the quality of hip surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
And eventually they agreed .
Once they agreed , they started measuring and sharing data .
Very quickly , they found that by putting concrete in the patient &apos;s bone before they put the head of the metal femur , that would last longer , and many patients would never have to be re-operated in their lives .
They published the data , and that really turned surgical practice into the country .
Everybody saw it made a lot of sense .
Since then , they have been publishing a year .
Once a year , they post the classic : who &apos;s the best , who &apos;s the worst ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , so it &apos;s a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , Swedish surgeons had the best results in the world , at least those who measured them , and many didn &apos;t .
I found this very passionate principle .
Surgeons come together , agree on what the quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they discover who &apos;s the best , and from that they learn .
I keep getting better and better .
This is not the only exciting part .
It &apos;s exciting for itself .
But if you put the costs back into the equation , and you look at them , it turns out that those who focused on quality also had the lowest costs , even though initially the goal wasn &apos;t that .
If we look again at the history of hip surgery , a study was done a couple of years ago in which the United States and Sweden were established .
They tested how many patients needed to be reoperated seven years after the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than Sweden .
So many unnecessary interventions , and a lot of unnecessary suffering for all the patients that had been operated over the course of those seven years .
You can imagine how many savings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
The OECD , every once in a while , analyzes the quality of care where it can find data about the members of the country .
The United States , for many diseases , actually has a quality under the average of the OECD countries .
If the U.S. health care system focused more on quality measurements , and increased quality at the OECD average , it would save Americans 500 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the country &apos;s health care budget .
Some people will say these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it doable ?
It would be a paradigm shift for health , and I &apos;m convinced not only that you can do it , but you have to do it .
Change agents are doctors and nurses in the health care system .
During my consultancy work , I meet maybe a hundred or more doctors and nurses and other health professionals every year .
The only thing they have in common is that they have a lot of heart what they do in terms of quality for their patients .
Like many of you in the audience , doctors are very competitive .
They were always the best of the class .
We were always the best of the class .
And if someone can show them that the outcome they reach for their patients is not better than others , they will do everything they need to improve .
Many of them don &apos;t know .
But doctors have another feature .
They make progress because of their peer recognition .
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist from a competitor hospital and discuss why the other hospital has better outcomes , it &apos;s about sharing .
They &apos;re going to share information about how to improve .
So , it &apos;s measuring and creating transparency , which is a continuous cycle of improvement , which is what this slide shows .
You might say it &apos;s a good idea , but that &apos;s not just an idea .
It actually happens .
We are creating a global community , a great global community , where we will be able to measure and compare what we do .
Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has given rise to what we call ICHOM .
The name sounds like a sneezer , but it &apos;s not . It &apos;s an acronym .
It &apos;s for the International Consorice for Sanitary Revolution .
We bring together the best physicians and patients to discuss , disease for disease , what really is the quality , what should we measure , to create global standards .
They &apos;ve been working — four working groups have been operated this last year : cataracts , back pain , coronaropathy , which is , for example , heart attack , prostate cancer .
The four groups will publish data in November this year .
It &apos;s the first time we &apos;re going to compare apples with apples , not just within a country , but in different countries .
Next year , we &apos;re predicting to look at eight diseases , the next year , 16 .
In three years , we expect to cover 40 percent of the disease .
Compare the apple with the apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why ?
Five months ago , I gave a workshop in the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , which has a vision : incentrate my grand institution much more about quality , about the results that matter to patients .
That particular day , we got together in a workshop with doctors , nurses and the rest of the staff , discussing leukemia in children .
The group talked about how to measure quality today .
Can we measure it better than how we do it ?
We &apos;ve talked about how we treat these children , what are important improvements ?
We &apos;ve talked about what the costs of these patients are , can we treat them more effectively ?
There was a huge amount of energy in the room .
There have been so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the president of the ward stood up .
He looked at the group and he said — I forgot , first he lifted his hand — he raised his hand , closed hand , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . We &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital is doing right now . &quot; &quot; By measuring the value in health , which is not just the costs but the important results for patients , hospital staff and the rest of the health care system are no longer going to be a problem but a big part of the solution .
I think measuring health value is going to lead to a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , Greek Ippocrates , which always puts the patient in the center , would smile from the grave .
Thank you .

I &apos;m excited to share with you some discoveries that really surprised me about what makes companies succeed better , what are the most important factors for the success of a startup .
You get them to do incredible things .
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what matters most to the success .
And I wanted to be systematic in my attempt to avoid some of my instincts and perceptions distorted by the many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
I wanted to know this because it &apos;s since I &apos;m 12 years old that I &apos;ve opened businesses , I sold sweet at the bus stop at high school , solar power devices at university , when I was making speakers .
And after graduation .
We learned a lot from failures .
And I followed these five .
The first , the idea .
I thought the idea was everything .
My company is called Idealab as much as I love the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; where you get the idea .
And yet , then I began to think that maybe the team , the execution , adaptability even counted more than the idea .
The customer is the tough reality .
And so I thought maybe the team is the most important thing .
And then I started looking at the business model .
Does the company have a clear path to generate customers &apos; revenue ?
It started to take over my thoughts as an element that determines success .
Then I looked at the funding .
Sometimes companies get big funding .
Is that the most important thing ?
And then , of course , the temple .
It &apos;s too early for an idea and the world isn &apos;t ready ?
Then , for the non-Idealab companies , I looked at the big successes , like Airbnb , Instagram and Uber , YouTube and LinkedIn .
That company came to the cliff of the recession when people needed money , and that maybe pushed people to overcome the fear of rent home to strangers .
But the timing was so perfect for their need of drivers .
The drivers were looking for extra money ; it was very important .
Go.To.com that we announced at TED in 1998 , was at the time when companies were trying to find profits to make traffic .
It was hard to watch online videos , you had to put codec in the browser and a lot of things and eventually the company closed in 2003 .
And yet , YouTube didn &apos;t have a business model at the beginning .
They were not sure it would work .
So , I would say , execution matters a lot .
The idea matters a lot .
But the timing matters even more .
And the best way to evaluate time is to look at if consumers are ready for what you have to offer .
Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a fantastic audience .

I would go to school . My expectations were high , I would gather in my student vision made of classes , parties and tricky counts .
Under that , I was deeply unhappy , insecure and substantially terrified — terrified by other people , from the future , from failure and void inside me .
I was leaving a seminar when it started , and I was dying and smuggled with the bag as I &apos;d done hundreds of times , when I suddenly heard a voice looking quietly , &quot; It &apos;s leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around me , and there was no one , but the clarity and the half of the comment was unambiguous .
&quot; He &apos;s opening the door . &quot;
It was just the beginning . The voice had arrived .
And the voice persisted , days and weeks later , continued to tell everything I did in third person .
&quot; He &apos;s going to class . &quot;
It was neutral , dough , and after a while , even strangely friendly and reassuring , although I noticed that sometimes she escaped her external calm and occasionally reflected my inexpressed emotions .
For example , if I was angry and I had to hide it , which I often did , as an expert in hiding my feelings , then the voice seemed frustrated .
A subdulous process of conditioning had begun : the implication that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I felt them meant something was not good at all .
For a while , I told the medical doctor at university .
To be honest , I was desperately looking for interest and help , and I started telling my strange commenter .
For example , I was part of a student television broadcast who was carrying news on campus , and during a sitting that she was doing late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I have to go .
At this point , events began to take over .
He followed a recipient in the hospital , the first of many , followed the diagnosis of schizophrenia , and then , the worst thing , a relentless sense of mistrust , humiliation and despair for myself and my perspectives .
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience , but as a symptom , fear and resistance intensified .
Basically , it meant having a aggressive attitude towards my mind , a kind of psychological civil war , and that caused an increase in the number of voices that progressively became hostile and threatening .
Do you see that glass of water ?
It had established a vicious circle of fear , elusion , mistrust and incomprehension , and it &apos;s a battle where I let myself engage , impotent and unable to establish any kind of peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , deterioration was dramatic .
At that point I had all the repertoire of the delusion : terrifying voices , gray visions , bizarre , uncurable illusions .
When you think about the disaster and the desperation of those years , it &apos;s as if someone had died in that place , and somebody else saved .
A weak and spectral person started that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would become the person I was destined to be .
A lot of people have injured me in life , and I remember them all , but the memories become held and blurry compared to the people who helped me .
I think Eleanor can overcome this .
Sometimes it snows until the month of May , but the summer before and then it always comes . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes are not enough to express recognition of all those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and waited to see me coming back from that lonely and agony place .
It was hard to believe at first , not least because voices seemed so hostile and threatening , so in this sense , a first life step was to learn how to separate a metaphorical meaning from what I had previously interpreted as truth in a literal sense .
So for example , the voices that threatened to attack my house , I learned to interpret them as my sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than being real , danger .
At first , I believed it .
I remember , for example , sitting one night guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a real threat of voices .
I used to say things like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give me a shot .
I have a plastic fork , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; &quot; Extraordinary .
It was armed with this awareness that I eventually reconstructed my being fragmented , every fragment represented by a different voice , I gradually removed all the drugs , and I went back to the psychiatrist , but this time on the other side .
Now I &apos;m proud to be part of Intervoice , the organizing body of the International Committee of Geneva an initiative inspired at the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , who identifies voices as a survival strategy , a healthy reaction to crazy circumstances ; not as a synthetic anorphony of schizophrenia to bear but a meaningful experience to explore .
This kind of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already being implemented .
To paraphrase Chavez , once we started , social change is not reversible .
You can &apos;t humiliate people who feel proud .
You can &apos;t oppress people who are no longer afraid .
Over the last 20 years , the Movement of the Genes Committees has introduced a network of auditors of voices in 26 countries of five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity , and legitimacy for individuals with mental problems , to create a new language and to convey hope , which , in the deep , has a tremendous faith in the power of individuals .
As Peter Levine says , the human animal is a unique , instinctive capacity to cure and spirit of exploitation of this innate ability .
In this sense , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege of facilitating this healing process of someone , to testify , to reach out , to share the weight of someone &apos;s suffering , and to keep the hope of recovery alive .
We &apos;re unique . We &apos;re unreplaceable .
What we have in it can never be really colonized , contacted , or taken away .
Light never turns off .
As a wonderful doctor once said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people say about you .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photograph .
But is it photography ?
I ask him why , of course , it &apos;s not a photograph that you can do with a camera .
My interest in photography was born with my first digital machine , at the age of 15 .
He crossed my previous passion for the drawing , but it was a little different because using the camera the key process was in planning .
And when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the shot button .
It made me feel like photography was more a matter of being in the right place at the right time .
It seemed to me that anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process started at the moment of the shot .
Show like this : you work in a busy street .
But it has something unexpected .
And yet , it keeps a dose of realism .
Or pictures like this , both dark and colorful , but all with the common goal of keeping a dose of realism .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually photograph , but I always want them to feel like they &apos;re kind of the real boxes .
Show where you take a few moments to understand the trick .
So it &apos;s more like a way of capturing an idea than capturing a moment .
But what is the trick that makes them look realistic ?
Is it something in the details or in colors ?
Something about light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the illusion is perspective .
But ultimately , everything depends on how we interpret the world and how we can represent it on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what &apos;s realistic , but what we think it sounds realistic .
I think the basics are pretty simple .
For me , it &apos;s just like a puzzle of reality from which to take different texts and combine them to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something that we can all associate with a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a way , they can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
But at the same time we know it can &apos;t .
So we decode our brain because this simply can &apos;t accept that the object doesn &apos;t make any sense .
I see the same process in combining photographs .
It &apos;s always about combining different realities .
The things that give the picture a realistic aspect , I think , are the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things that are around us every day .
But when you combine photographs , it &apos;s very important to keep in mind , because otherwise it looks like something doesn &apos;t square .
I would say there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic result .
As you can see , these pictures are nothing special .
But combine can create something like this .
The first rule is that the pictures that we can combine should have the same perspective .
The second , photos should have the same kind of light .
And these two pictures have these two requirements , taken from the same height and with the same light .
The third rule is to make it impossible to tell where the different images start and end up , making it all fluid .
It makes it impossible to understand how the image was made .
By organizing color , contrast and brightness there where different images come together , adding photographic flaws as depth of field , colored colors and noise , we can erase the edges between different images and make them look like one , despite the fact that an image can hold hundreds of levels in practice .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) You might think it &apos;s just a picture of a landscape and that manipulation is the lower part .
But this picture is actually made out of different places .
And I personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place that can flourish it , so you don &apos;t need to go down to compromise with the ideas that we have in mind .
But you need accurate planning .
When I had this idea in the winter , I knew I had many months to organize myself , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was photographed as I was fishing .
Rives come from different locations .
The underwater part was photographed in a stone hole .
And yes , I even colored the house on the red island to look more Swedish .
So to get a realistic result , it &apos;s all about planning .
It always starts with a drawing , an idea .
And then it &apos;s about combining the different pictures .
And here every piece is very well-planned .
If you do a good job by taking pictures , the result can be very beautiful and also remarkably realistic .
The tools of the craft are available , the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

&#91; April 3 , 2016 was the largest news escape of history &#93; &#91; The Panama Papers showed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; hiding large assets on offshore &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness &#93; This week , there was a real , huge amount of stories unleashed by a flight of 11 million documents from a Panama &apos;s office called Fox .
The spread of these documents reveals only a small piece of the secret world of offshore accounts .
We can see how private customers , banks and lawyers go to studies like Mossack Fonseca and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we want an anonymous company , can you give them one ? &quot; &quot; You can actually read email , text exchanges , the mechanics behind this , like all of this works .
Now , there have been some pretty immediate repercussions already .
The Icelandic Prime Minister gave dimissions .
We &apos;ve come to know that even an allies of the brutal dictator Syrian Bashar Al-Assad has offshore societies .
It was mentioned by a two-billion-dollar track that goes to the Russian Vladimir Putin through his dear childhood friend , which is also a famous violonist .
And out there will be a lot of rich individuals and others who will be upset by thinking about the next set of stories and the next flight of documents .
Well , it looks like the plot of a spying thriller or a novel by John Grisham .
It looks very far from normal people like you and me .
Why should we care ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful characters can hide their money overseas , without paying the taxes they show , it means there will be less money for basic public services like health care , education , road maintenance .
And this is about all of us .
Now , for my organization Global Witness , this revelation has been phenomenal .
We hear global media and political leaders talk about how some individuals can use offshore accounts to hide and mask their goods , a problem we &apos;ve been talking about and we &apos;ve been showing for 10 years .
It seems to me that a lot of people consider this disconcerting world and cannot understand how this kind of offshore world works .
I like to describe it as a kind of matrioska .
So you can imagine a closed society within another closed society within another society again , so it becomes almost impossible to understand who &apos;s behind these structures .
It can be very difficult for the storage , or the whistle , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
It also seems interesting to me that there has been less media coverage in the United States .
And maybe it &apos;s because there &apos;s not a lot of American personalities in these revelations , in this scandal .
Now , that doesn &apos;t mean that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their goods abroad .
Rather , because of how the offshore system works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers .
If it was a news escape from the Cayman Islands , or even from Delaware , from Wyoming or Nevada , you would hear a lot more cases and examples related to Americans .
In fact , in many states in America , they require less information , you need to provide less information to build a company that to make a card in the library .
This reservation in the United States allowed employees to derubate their pupils .
It allowed fraudsters to derubate vulnerable investors .
This kind of practice affects all of us .
And here at Global Witness , we wanted to see how this happens in reality .
How does it work ?
What we did was we sent an investigator from 13 legal studies in Manhattan .
Our investigator ended up with an African minister who wanted to transfer suspicious funds to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
Now , the really shocking thing is that all those lawyers except one have given advice to our investigator to transfer those suspicious funds .
They were all preliminary meetings , we didn &apos;t hired any of those lawyers , and of course there was no money involved , but already from here you see the problem of this system .
It &apos;s also important not to look at these as isolated cases .
It &apos;s not about a single lawyer who spoke to our investigator by giving them suggestions .
It &apos;s not about a political leader in particular at the center of a scandal .
It &apos;s about how a system works , which strengthen corruption , tax evasion , poverty , instability .
And to counter that , we have to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make these practices harder .
This may sound hopeless to you because there &apos;s nothing you can do , because nothing has changed , because there will always be rich and powerful characters .
But I &apos;m optimistic , and I see there &apos;s some change going on .
In the last two years , we &apos;ve seen a real push to greater transparency in the constitution of society .
The issue was added to the political agenda by the first British minister David Cameron at a G8 summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union has decided to create central registries at the national level of those who own and control societies in Europe .
What &apos;s sad is the United States has stayed behind .
There &apos;s a bipartisan law , which was introduced to the House and the Senate , but it &apos;s not giving the results that we were hoping for .
And we really want the Panama Papers , this great beer inside the offshore world , to be used to step forward in the United States and around the world .
For us at Global Witness , this is the moment of change .
We need normal people to break down the way people can hide their identity behind secret societies .
We need entrepreneurs to stand up and say , &quot; This reservation is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and engage in changing the law to break this reservation .
Together , we can change the recklessness that is allowing the fiscal evasion to corruption , to the money laundering to thrive .
Chris Anderson : Welcome Julian .
It &apos;s said that Wikileaks , your creature , has — in the last few years made more media records classified all over the world put together .
Is it possible that this corresponds to the real ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , how does it be true ?
It &apos;s worrying — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the media around the world is working so bad that a small group of activists can publish more information than the rest of the world &apos;s press put together .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people distribute documents ?
And how do you ensure privacy ?
JA : These are — for what we understand — classic &quot; &quot; blow . &quot; &quot; And we have various ways for information to get there .
We use cutting-edge cryptographs to bounce the material on the Internet , cover the traces , pass through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to attach these legal protections .
We get the information through the ordinary mail , cryptographic or not , we test them how the regional information agencies do , we train them what is sometimes very difficult to do , when it comes to gigantic databases of information — we distribute them to the public and then we defend against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
CA : So you try to ensure that documents are legitimate , but you don &apos;t really know the identity of the source .
JA : Yeah , yeah . Very rarely we know , and if we get to know that , we destroy that information as soon as possible .
( Ringing the phone ) Maledition .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the CIA that asks what the code is to associate with TED . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s take a real example .
This is something you drilled a few years ago .
If we can have the document on the screen ...
This was a story a few years ago in Kenya .
Can you tell us what you revealed and what happened ?
JA : It &apos;s the Kroll report .
A secret services report on the request of the Kenyan government after the 2004 election .
Before 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for 18 years .
He was a blando dictator in Kenya .
And when Kibaki went to power — mediating a coalition of forces trying to clean Kenya out of corruption — ordered this inquiry , spesert two million pounds on this and on other related strings .
And then the government put it aside and used it to influence Moi politically , which was the richest man — and it &apos;s still — in Kenya .
It &apos;s the Sacro Grail of Kenyan journalism .
So I went to Kenya in 2007 , and I was able to get the documents just before the election — the national elections of December 28 .
When we published the inquiry , we did it three days after President Kibaki decided to become a man &apos;s friend who was about to epurate , Daniel arap Moi . So this inquest became a mortal burden for President Kibaki .
CA : And to cut a long story short — the news of the inchiesta drove into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly . And , you know , it actually pushed the electorate .
JA : Yes , it was the first page of the Guardian and then it was published in the surrounding countries of Kenya , from the press in Tanzania and South Africa .
And so it came from the outside .
And this , after a few days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
And he talked about Kenyan TV for 20 straight hours , and he moved the vote of 10 percent , according to a Kenyan service ratio , which changed the election result .
CA : Wow , so your breath has really changed the world ?
Ja : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : So here — let me show you a little excerpt from this video of an airborne cursion on Baghdad .
The video is longer . But here &apos;s a little excerpt .
It &apos;s — I warn you — very strong material .
Radio : ... very fancy , when you &apos;re up there , you &apos;re out there .
I see your element , ah , I have four Humvees , ah , along the way .
Go . All right . Fire .
Let me know when you caught them . Fire .
Out of all of them .
Come on , fire !
( Brew sounds ) Keep shooting . Keep shooting . ( Breaking ends ) Keep shooting .
Hotel — Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six .
We have to move now !
Well , we just ingested all eight individuals .
Yes , you see two of them , and we &apos;re still shooting .
Recognize . I got it .
Two-Six , here Two- Six , we &apos;re moving .
Oops , sorry . What happened ?
Maledition , Kyle . Well , hahaha . I hit them .
CA : How did that impact ?
JA : The impact on people that worked on it was heavy .
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to do more research on this story .
This is just the first of three attacks that happened on this scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right ? I got two Reuters employees ?
JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two small children were hurt .
There were between 18 and 26 people killed in total .
CA : And the publication of this movie caused a lot of outrage .
What was the key element that actually caused the outrage , in your opinion ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I imagine people are able to see the enormous inequality of forces .
There are people walking peacefully on the street , and then an Apache helicopter hiding in a corner that shoots 30 millimeter projectors on everyone — looking for a excuse for anything to do it — and killing people who watch wounds .
And there were two journalists involved that obviously weren &apos;t the insurgency , because that &apos;s a full-time job .
CA : I mean , there was this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , who was arrested , and he said he confessed in a &quot; &quot; chat &quot; &quot; net that he had drilled this video to Wikileaks along with 280,000 pieces of US Embassy communication .
I mean , did he do that ?
JA : So we denied getting those messages .
It was accused , about five days ago , of getting 150,000 communications and posted 50 .
Now , we had published in the beginning of the year a US Embassy communication in Reykjavik , but there &apos;s not necessarily a link .
I mean , I was a visitor who was known about that embassy .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of diplomatic communications from the U.S. Embassy ...
JA : We would make it public . ( CA : Really ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) JA : Well , because these things reveal the reality of , let &apos;s say , what are the Arab governments , and the real abuse of human rights in this government ?
If you look at communications declassified , this is the kind of material that they have .
CA : Let &apos;s talk more generally about that .
That is , in general , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it fair to encourage people to suffer on secret information ?
JA : Well , the question is what kind of information is important for the world what kind of information is capable of delivering reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So the information that organizations make financial efforts to keep them hidden is very clear that when that information comes out there is hope that it does well , because organizations who know it , who know it all are spending to keep it secret .
And this is what we found in practice , and this is the story of journalism .
CA : But is there no risk that , for the direct interested or even for society in its together , the sufferings can really have unintended consequences ?
JA : Never seen anything like this with the material that we published .
That is , we have a badly immunization policy .
We have a way of treating information that has something personal — information that can identify one person .
But there are legitimate secrets — let &apos;s say , personal data , this is a legitimate secret , but we deal with those who pass the bars that are really motivated .
CA : So they &apos;re very motivated .
And what would you say , for example , to a parent — whose son is serving in the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you published something that has a second end .
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing in front of people who die .
That &apos;s from the impression that — it &apos;s given the impression to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are disuitous people .
But it &apos;s not . My son is not like that . How boring ? &quot; &quot; What would you say ?
JA : Yeah , we have a lot of these examples .
But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So the video won &apos;t change their opinion , it won &apos;t change their perception .
This is what they see every day .
It &apos;s going to change the perception and the opinion of the people who are paying for all this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you &apos;ve found a way to shine light into what you see as all of these unconfessable secrets in companies and governments .
Light is good .
But don &apos;t you see the irony that , in order to get that light to shine , should you be creating secrecy on your sources ?
JA : Not really . I mean , we haven &apos;t had dissidents in Wikileaks yet .
We don &apos;t have sources that are dissident about other sources .
If this happened , it would be a very complicated situation for us , but , presumably , we act in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue the mission , not compromise it .
CA : I would actually be interested , based only on what I &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious to have the TED audience &apos;s opinion .
You know , there can be a couple of views on Wikileaks and Julian .
You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — leading this important light .
Periculous fomentator , agitator .
Who sees it as a hero ?
Who is a dangerous agitator ?
JA : Come on . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a mite audience , Julian , a mite audience .
We need to try it better . Let &apos;s put it in front of another example .
This is something you haven &apos;t published yet , but you &apos;re about to publish for TED .
I mean , it &apos;s an intriguing story that just happened , right ?
What is this about ?
JA : This is an example of what we do , almost every day .
At the end of last year — last November — there were a series of wells explosions in Albania like the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , but not that big .
And we got an inquest — sort of a technical analysis of what happened — that said that the jurred guards of rival oil companies and competitors actually had parked trucks and had them jump .
And that part of the Albanese government was implicated , etc .
And the technical relationship had no title or intestation , and it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t test it because we didn &apos;t know who was going to make it and what it was .
So we were skeptical , and we thought maybe a rival oil company was making his games .
With this assumption , we made it public and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , the feeling is that it &apos;s good , but we can &apos;t test it . &quot; &quot; And so we got a letter just this week from the company that breathed it , that wants to go back to the source of the ceiling — ( Laughter ) that says , &quot; &quot; Hei , we want to track the source . &quot; &quot; And so we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is that ?
Can you show that you have legal authority on that document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screenshot with the author and identity to Microsoft Word .
Yeah .
( Applause ) There &apos;s a lot of things going on .
This is one of our ways of identifying — to test what material is , let &apos;s try to make them write a letter .
CA : Yeah . Have you had information from the inside of the BP ?
JA : Yeah , a lot , but , let &apos;s say , at the moment , we &apos;re doing some kind of fundraising effort and technology .
So the publication rate over the last few months has been said to be reduced to the minimum as we rebuild our appliance computer systems because of the phenomenal interest in the public .
It &apos;s a problem .
That is , like every organization at the exorse that &apos;s growing , we &apos;re like being overwhelmed by our own growth , and that means that there are huge amounts of soft and revelations of very high calibro , but we don &apos;t have enough personal enough to examine and flash this information .
CA : So here &apos;s the main bottleneck in poor words : voluntary journalists and / or the funding for journalists ?
JA : Yeah . Of course , and trust people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s not easy to grow up fast for the kind of material that we treat , so we have to restructure ourselves so that we have people who manage the high-level national security stuff , and then the low-security cases .
CA : Help us understand something about you , about your person and how you got to this .
And I think I &apos;ve read that you as a child have been in 37 different schools .
Is it possible ?
JA : So my parents were working in the cinema and then they were on the way out of a joke , and so the whole of the two things ...
( Laughter ) CA : A psychologist might say it &apos;s a paranoid formula .
JA : What , the movie industry ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you &apos;ve also been — you &apos;ve also been a young hacker , and you &apos;ve had to deal with the authorities as a young man .
JA : I was a journalist .
You know , I was a young activist journalist at a very early age .
I wrote a magazine , I was processed for that magazine when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with the word &quot; &quot; hackers &quot; &quot; expression .
I mean , it &apos;s a method — there &apos;s a method that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately at the moment , it &apos;s mainly used by Russian mafia to steal the bank of their grandmothers .
So expression is not — it &apos;s not as pleasant as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing from the bank account of any grandchild , but what about your fundamental values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe even an episode of your life that has contributed to determining them ?
JA : I can &apos;t point to a specific event .
But the fundamental values , the capable , generous men don &apos;t create victims ; they occupy victims .
And this is something that comes to me from my father and other capable and generous men who have been part of my life .
CA : Happy , generous men don &apos;t create victims ; do they care about victims ?
JA : Yeah . And , you know , I &apos;m a fighter person , so I &apos;m not very good when it comes to cousing , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to cook victims , which is to stand on the accountants of crime .
And so this is something that &apos;s been part of my personality for a long time .
CA : Now tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story of what happened in Iceland ?
Basically you published something there , there were problems with a bank , and then information services there had the junction of not publishing .
On the contrary , they gave visibility to your side .
This made you a spicy character in Iceland , and then ?
JA : Yeah , it &apos;s a big case , you know .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
It &apos;s been struck harder than any other country in the world .
The banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
So , we publish this inch in July last year .
And national television comes the injection five minutes before the transmission , as in a movie , the joint came to the desk of the editorship , and the journalist says something like , &quot; Has nothing happened . What to do ? &quot;
Well , let &apos;s show the picture of the website , instead of the news all the time , as filling , and so we became very famous in Iceland , we went to Iceland and and talked about the issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that these things never had to happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and other international lawsuits , we assembled a kind of legislative package for Iceland that became a kind of sentimental port for free press with the most powerful journalists in the world , with a Nobel Prize for press freedom .
Iceland is a Northern country and so , like Norway , is able to access the system .
And just a month ago , it was approved by the Icelandic parliament to unanimity .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) One last question , Julian .
When you think about the future , then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be the advent of a Big Brother that has more control , more secrecy , or are we on the Great Brother , or is it all to play ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure how it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there are huge pressures to harmonize legislation in fact of freedom of expression and legislation on transparency around the world — within the European Union , between China and the United States .
Where are you going to go ? It &apos;s hard to understand .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s very interesting to live right now , because if we strive a little bit , we can move things from one side or another .
CA : Well , I think you &apos;re interpreting the public &apos;s opinion by saying , Julian , you &apos;re careful and you can do it .
JA : Thank you Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel incredibly lucky to belong to a country that is generally considered as the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven , women in Iceland did a strike .
They didn &apos;t work that day , whether they were a professional or a homemaker .
They marched all the way to the center of Reykjavik , and he Partecuted 90 percent of women , peacefully and spirit of solidarity closed equality .
Everything stopped that day in Iceland , because nothing works when women are not at work .
( Applause ) Five years later , Icelandians had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratize a woman as president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , in which President Vigdess &apos;s as we know her with her name of the joke , she grabbed from her home balcony , single mother with a daughter next to her as an election winner .
( Applause ) This woman was a role model for me and for everyone who grew up at that time , including males .
She often tells the story of when she was approached by a young boy after a couple of emails and asked her , &quot; &quot; Can kids really grow up to be presidents ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Behavioral models are really important , but despite these very strong models that I am grateful for , when I was encouraged to run as president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I going to run as president ?
Who am I to be president ? Turns out , women are less likely than men to run .
An American research that was conducted in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men thought they were going into politics against 45 percent of women .
This is a 16-percentile divide , and it &apos;s the same gap that existed a decade before .
And it &apos;s really a shame , because I &apos;m really convinced that the world needs women and more leadership based on principles in general .
So my decision to run for me is fundamentally derived from having felt that I had to give my contribution despite having no political experience , to move forward and be part of the creation of a world that made sense and was sustainable for our children , a world where we can allow our kids and girls to be anything they can be .
And this was the journey of my life .
It was amazing .
The journey started with more or less 20 candidates .
He went down to nine qualified candidates , and eventually we ran for four , three men and I .
( Applause ) But the drama doesn &apos;t stop there .
You think the real drama is in America , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we &apos;ve had our drama in Iceland .
The time the president in charge for 20 years announced initially that he wouldn &apos;t be restored , which perhaps started many candidates .
Later he changed his mind , when our prime minister gave dimissions because of the case &quot; &quot; Panama Papers &quot; &quot; in which he and his family were involved .
There was a popular protest in Iceland , and the president in charge thought that there needed a reliable candidate .
A few days later , relationships on his wife and the companies of his family came out in the Panama Papers and so he decided to retreat his candidates again .
Before he did that , he said he would do it because now there were two qualified men candidates who stimulated as possible successors to his charge .
So on May nine , 45 days before the election , there was no good prospect for me .
I didn &apos;t even appear on the newspaper chart .
The polls gave me to one percent , but this was the best that any female candidate ever got .
So it &apos;s a statement under tone to say that I had to work really hard to find my place and have access to television , because the network had decided to only include those with 2.5 percent or more in polls in the first TV debate .
I found in the afternoon of the first TV debate that I was going to attend myself with three men , and I found it on TV show that I had reached 2.5 percent the day of the TV debate .
( Applause ) So , the challenges .
The biggest challenges that I faced and overcome on this journey have been to do with media , muscles and money .
Let &apos;s start with media .
Some people say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I don &apos;t think I agree .
I &apos;ve had more difficulty getting access and time available in the media .
There is evidence that the leader candidate appeared in transmissions 87 times in the next few months in the election , while I appeared 31 times .
And I &apos;m not saying that media consciously does this .
I think it &apos;s often an unconscious bias , because in the media , like elsewhere , you can find conscious and unconscious bias , and we have to find the courage to talk about it if we want to change it .
When I finally got access to TV , the first question they asked me was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to leave ? &quot; &quot; It was a difficult question .
But of course , with polls from one percent to 2.5 percent , maybe it &apos;s understandable .
But the media is important , and every time I was on TV , we saw our consensus go up in the polls , so I know from direct experience how important it is and why we have to talk about it .
I was the only one in the four candidates who hadn &apos;t had an interview on the front page .
Sometimes they jumped on questions made for all the other candidates and out of the media attention .
I &apos;ve tackled this , but I still have to make compliments to the Icelandic media .
I had almost no comment on my packaging and clothing .
( Applause ) So glory to them .
But there &apos;s another experience that &apos;s just as important .
I ran for myself as independent , without any political party or political force on my side .
This lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably had its own weight on our campaign , but it allowed us to innovate and to do politics differently .
We did a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of elections for others .
One possible reason I had less space on television , because I wanted to show the respect for other candidates .
After realizing how hard the access to the media was , we used our own .
I made live sessions on Facebook where I got questions about every issue and I responded directly to .
We put all the questions and answers on Facebook because we thought transparency was important if you want to create trust .
And when it turned out to be very difficult to get to the younger voters , I became a Snapchatter .
I got young people who taught me , and I used all Snapchat filters during the last part of the campaign .
And I had to use a lot of humor and humility , because I was really bad .
And because of that , we &apos;ve grown consensus among young people .
So you can run a different election campaign .
But unfortunately , we can &apos;t talk about politics without mention the money .
I &apos;m sorry that &apos;s the case , but it &apos;s the truth , and we &apos;ve had less economic resources than other candidates .
This is probably partly because I think I &apos;ve had more difficulty in requesting financial support .
And maybe even because I had the ambition that I could do more with less .
Somebody will say it &apos;s my typical female thing .
But even with a third of the media , a third of the financial resources , and a team of just entrepreneurial but wonderful , we were able to surprise all the night of the election , when the first data came .
I surprised myself , as you can see from the picture .
( Laughter ) Here are the first numbers . I was head head with the main candidate .
( Cheers ) Well , too soon , but I didn &apos;t do that . I came second . We had come a long way from that one percent down to about a third of the votes , and we defeated the polls with an unprecedented margin : 10 percentage points compared to the latest polls .
So some people called me the real elections winner , and many people encouraged me to run again .
The thing that makes me more proud is to know that I &apos;ve obtained a percentage of greater consensus from young people and many people have asked my daughter to present in 2040 .
( Applause ) She &apos;s 13 years old , and she &apos;s never been on TV before .
The day of the election , I watched it on TV repeatedly . She was awake and confident of herself , sincere and support for her mother .
This was perhaps the culmination of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
Audience : Oh !
This image was basically a victory for me .
What we see is what we can be .
It educates fear and challenge .
( Applause ) It &apos;s important that women are willing to do and run for a trona that is Amministrator Delegate or the presidential office .
I &apos;ve also managed to leave a sign on your &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve earned a new title , &quot; &quot; a living emoji of sincerity . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) It &apos;s probably the title I &apos;m most proud of right now , and the reason is that women too often get penalized because they use what I call their emotional capital , but I know for experience that we really become good when we use it .
( Applause ) And we need more .
We celebrated as if we won the election night , because that &apos;s how we felt .
So you don &apos;t necessarily have to get to that office .
But you have to try to conquer it . And you , your family , your friends , and anyone who works with you , if you do that seriously , you will grow well beyond any other past experience .
We &apos;ve had fun , I &apos;ve learned a lot from this journey , maybe a lot more lessons than I can share with you here in the time that we have .
But make sure , it was a tough job .
I lost so many hours of sleep in these months .
It took resilience and perseverance to not quit , but I learned something that I learned earlier , in the day of one percent , which is that things can only go well when you listen real and authentic your inner voice and work in sync with it .
As a good sister often says , you can cheat your intuition , but your intuition will never cheat you .
I think it &apos;s also very important , and all of you know , on any journey you &apos;re on , the team you &apos;re going to bring with you .
Cyrus of people who share your values , vision , but are different about the rest .
This to me is the formula of success , and I &apos;m fortunate enough to have a wonderful husband , who is here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena , and we came up with something that everybody thought was impossible .
In fact , the Pubblic Relations expert told me before I made my decision that I was going to be okay , I was going to get seven percent .
I appreciated his perspective because he probably was right , it was based on his precious experience .
But the day of one percent right now , I decided to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s very important to mention it , because I lost a lot of hours of sleep , and I worked hard , as well as others with me .
We can &apos;t go far if we fail to take care of ourselves .
And I think there are two very important things in the process , that of surrounding ourselves with people and habits that feed us , but it &apos;s still important , and maybe even more to have the courage to get rid of people and habits that take us out energy , including wonderful bloggers and commentators .
I got a lot of support from others on this issue , and I decided to point out when others were pointing down , and that &apos;s partly the way I maintained energy in the way .
And when I lost my energy for a while — and it happened sometimes , it wasn &apos;t easy — I came back to thinking about the reasons I decided to run and how I decided to compete .
I called it the 4 G campaign , where the G represent some Icelandic words .
The first one is &quot; &quot; Gagn . &quot; &quot; I ran for good , to be in service , and I wanted a service leadership to be at the center of how I worked with everybody else in the campaign .
The second is &quot; &quot; Glexi &quot; &quot; or joy .
I decided to enjoy my journey .
There was so much to learn on the journey , no matter whether the destination was achieved or not .
And I gave the best to inspire others in the same way .
The third is &quot; &quot; Spanish . &quot; &quot; I was open to every question .
I had no secrets , everything transparent about Facebook and websites .
Because I think as you choose your president , you deserve answers to your questions .
Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain it to this room , we ran for the &quot; &quot; Girl Power &quot; &quot; principle .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m really happy to have the courage to run , risking to fail , but successful on so many plans .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I also believe that all my team is from the same kind , which is worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I don &apos;t let you go again . Hal Tódóttir : What a wonderful audience . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying .
And maybe everybody in here is ready to move to Iceland and vote .
It &apos;s certainly not going to be possible to vote for you , but one thing we can take from Iceland and that we &apos;ve always taken is inspiration .
And that , maybe you don &apos;t know this , because our American media didn &apos;t bring it back , Icelandic women went back to Monday Square . Right ?
HT : Yeah , that &apos;s it . PM : Can you tell us something about it ?
HT : Yeah , 41 years after the initial strike , we could consider ourselves the best place in the world to be women , but the work is not over .
So at 14 and 38 on Monday , women quit their job , because it was the exact time they earned their day .
( Applause ) What was really exciting is that young women and men have been involved with more numbers than the past , because it &apos;s time to close the retributive divide .
PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask Hal to engage immediately in what he &apos;s going to do next , but I &apos;m saying you would have a huge army of volunteers if I had to decide to do it again .
Thank you Hal .
HT : Thank you all .
( Applause )
There &apos;s a child looking at his father and saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , as a great man , I want to be the former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve had a great fortune as a former president , because I &apos;ve had the opportunity that very few other people around the world have had , to meet so many people around the world .
I don &apos;t just know the 50 states of the United States , but my wife and I visited over 145 countries , and the Carter Center supported full-time programs in well 80 countries .
Our global commitment to the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I know it , I can tell you without any evidence that the number one violation of human rights , which strangely don &apos;t talk about , is the abuse of women and girls .
( Applause ) This happens for some reasons I want to talk about , in openness .
First of all , misinterpretation of the Bible , the Old Testament , the New Testament , the Koran , etc . These were misinterpreted in synagogues , churches and mosques .
They interpret these rules to make women regularly relegate in a secondary position than men in the eyes of God .
It &apos;s a very serious problem that is regularly ignored .
Why should I pay them a pay for the same kind of work ?
The other very serious point that causes this problem is overuse of violence , which is growing in a strange way around the world .
In the United States of America , for example , we &apos;ve had an enormous increase in abuse on poor people , mostly black and minorities , being locked in prison .
When I was a governor in Georgia , one in 1,000 Americans was in prison .
Today , 7.3 people in 1,000 are in prison .
The number went up seven times .
We are also one of the few civil world countries that still has death penalty .
Now we &apos;re in California , the other day I learned that California spent four billion dollars on the 13-person death sentence .
In fact , in California , the expenditure to execute a death sentence at 307 million dollars .
One is genital mutilation .
Genital mutilation is horrible and unknown to American women , but in some countries , in many countries , when a female is born , rather early in her life , her genitals are completely reviewed with a kind of cut that has a blade of rasoe , which is not sterilized . They remove the external parts of female genitalia .
Then , when you get married , the same cutter opens up the orphanal so it can have sex .
It &apos;s not a rare practice , although it &apos;s illegal in many countries .
In Egypt , for example , 91 percent of the females who live in Egypt &apos;s day were sexually mutilated in that way .
In some countries , more than 98 percent of women are mutilated that way before they achieve maturity .
It &apos;s a terrible struggle for all the women who live in those countries .
This is committed by members of his own family , so the family become murderers when the girl brings to the family the so-called ungrace .
Another problem that we have in the world that is linked to women is slavery today is called human trafficking .
Today there are 30 million people living in slavery .
The U.S. State Department had Congress sent out an annual report , and the State Department reported that 800,000 people sold as slaves across international borders every year and that 80 percent of them are women , sold as slaves of sex .
Right now in the United States , 60,000 people live in slavery .
In Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center sits and I teach at Emory University 200-300 women are sold as slaves every month .
It &apos;s the main location in which this happens .
If the owner of a brothel wants to buy a brown or black carnage girl , she can do it for 1,000 dollars .
A white girl is worth a lot more , the curutary of a common stock in Atlanta and the United States can earn about 35,000 dollars a slave .
This is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there is no brothel in America that is not known by local officials , by local police , by police chief or by the mayor and so on .
Sweden had a good approach .
About 15 / 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted because they &apos;re in the state of sexual slavery , they &apos;re pursuing the curutary of the edges , protectors and customers , ( Applause ) and prostitution has fallen .
In the United States , for every man who is arrested for illegal sexual transaction , 25 women are arrested .
And this is another thing that you could do .
In the military , they &apos;re looking at how many sexual aggression they have .
In the last report I received was about 26,000 sexual aggressions that took place in the military , 26,000 .
Only 3,000 , not more than one percent , are actually pursued , and the reason is that the official in command of every organization like my submarine , or a battalion of the Army or a Marine company , the command officer has the right to decide whether to pursue a violator or not , and of course , the last thing they want is somebody to know what they &apos;re doing under their sexual assault , so they &apos;re not .
The law has to be changed .
One out of four women entering American universities will suffer sexual assault before graduation , and this is now news , partly because of my book among other things , and so 89 universities in America have been sentenced by the Department of Education according to the Title IX because college officials don &apos;t care about women protecting them from sexual aggression .
The Justice Department says that more than half of the violence on college campus is perpetrated by serial rapers , because outside the university system , if they raped someone would be lost , but when they get to the college campus .
They &apos;re not prosecuted .
This is the kind of thing that happens in our society .
When I became president , it was 39 percent .
We &apos;ve made some progress , partly because I &apos;ve been president — ( Applause ) — ( Laughter ) but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress , so the difference is still 23 to 24 percent in the last 15 years .
This is the kind of thing that happens .
If you take the first 500 companies according to Fortune only 23 have a CEO of 500 women , and those CEOs , I &apos;ll tell you , they earn less than the other CEOs .
This is what happens in our country .
Another problem in the United States is that we are the most warrior nation in the world .
We &apos;ve been in war with 25 countries since World War II .
Some times we had soldiers fighting on the ground .
Other times , of course , today we have .
There have been four years , I &apos;m not going to tell you which , where we haven &apos;t been , ( Applause ) we haven &apos;t shot bullets .
However , these kinds of things , the recourse to violence and bad interpretation of the sacred scripts are the causes , the fundamental causes .
But there &apos;s another primary cause , and you don &apos;t need to tell you , and that &apos;s that , in general , men give up .
( Applause ) It &apos;s true .
Race discrimination , has been legally for 100 years , since 1865 at the end of the war between states , the Civil War , until the 1960s , when Lyndon Johnson passed the law for equal rights .
During this period , there were many white people who didn &apos;t think racial discrimination was right , but they were shut down , because they were enjoying the privileges of better jobs , the access to exclusive jobs to legal places , to better schools , and all the rest of it , and that &apos;s the same thing that happens today , because the average man doesn &apos;t really care .
Even if he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against female discrimination , &quot; &quot; he enjoys the position of privilege .
So what &apos;s the most important thing to do today ?
I would argue that the best thing we can do today is that women of powerful countries like this , and the ones that you come from , Europe and so on , who have influence , have to take responsibility for asking more strongly the end of racial discrimination to women and girls all over the world .
The average woman in Egypt has no voice on her daughters who are mutilated or anything .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
&quot; What I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to dance to the sound of your war drums .
I &apos;m not going to give them my soul or my bones .
I &apos;m not going to dance at their pace .
I know that rhythm .
It has no life .
I know intimately the skin that you hit .
He was alive once , hunted , stolen , stunned .
I &apos;m not going to dance to the sound of the drums of your war .
I &apos;m not going to skip , I &apos;m not going to rotate , I &apos;m not going to be toughts for you .
I &apos;m not going to hate you , and I &apos;m not going to hate you either .
I &apos;m not going to kill you .
I &apos;m not going to die for you at all .
I &apos;m not going to celebrate the fruit by killing or killing me .
I &apos;m not going to come with you and dance for bombs just because everyone dance .
Everybody can be wrong .
Life is a right , not side or random .
I will not forget where I come from .
I &apos;m going to build my drum out of me .
I &apos;m going to ask my loved ones next to me , and we &apos;re going to get up with dance .
Our whispers will be our drums .
I &apos;m not going to present to their game .
I &apos;m not going to name my name and my rhythm to your music .
I &apos;m going to dance , I &apos;m going to resist , dance , I &apos;m going to persist and dance .
The heart rate is stronger than death .
Your war drum is no longer a sound of my breath . Haaa .
What happens to TED people ? Let me hear a little bit of a laugh .
( Applause ) A pack of pacifists .
Pacifists confused , with aspirations .
I understand you .
I &apos;ve made a lot of mistakes recently .
Just a lot .
So I wasn &apos;t sure what I was going to read to you today .
I mean , I said I was preparing .
I mean , preparing what I would wear , ( Laughter ) setting up my options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m chasing and what I &apos;m preceding .
It &apos;s poetry to do that .
Poetry prepares you , it &apos;s about you .
Now I &apos;m going to read a poem that I picked right now .
But I need you to sit down for 10 minutes and hug a woman who &apos;s not there .
Take it away now .
You don &apos;t need to call it by name , just embrace it .
Are you doing that ?
The title is &quot; &quot; Pause from the cluster . &quot; &quot; The whole sacred story bandita .
The unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
But my mind opens up on what seems limitless , the creative violence of man .
Who will that son be ?
What male child will die today ?
The death of our children is galvanizing us .
There are cute those cadavers .
We women bring the fruit , complicated .
They were beaten every day .
Indone profits , ignored profits .
War and unhappy teeth salted to lemon taste .
A color cart , none of us solid .
Don &apos;t look for the shadow behind me . It &apos;s inside me .
I live light and shadow cycles .
The rhythm is a half-silence .
Now I understand , I &apos;ve never been one and not the other .
Maltia , health , held violence .
Now I think I &apos;ve never been pure .
Before the form I was storm , blind , ignorant — I am still .
Human is by blind , malignant choice .
I &apos;ve never been .
Sacked before it matured .
Language can &apos;t mess me .
I hope exponentially .
Everything is everything .
A woman loses 15 , maybe 20 family members .
One loses six .
A woman loses her head .
One is looking for the rubble , one of the waste .
One shoots in her face . A woman shoots her husband .
One hit with cinghia .
A woman gives birth to a child .
One causes borders to emerge .
One no longer believes that love can rain it .
A woman never believed us .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
Dismissed , unrespected , sent where they don &apos;t belong , they don &apos;t want to be abandoned .
They have to face absence .
We plant each other , or we don &apos;t mean anything .
My spinal cord folds spirally .
We &apos;re throwing into a precipice , escaping from humans .
Bombs cluster behind us .
Nine-man .
Once it burns slowly .
Tobacco necks contaminated .
Back of bombs .
Make tooth with milk .
Stop with palm , smoke .
Top witnesses , smoke .
Outions , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Rediting , smoking .
It breathes .
Don &apos;t fear what &apos;s already exploded .
Rather , it exploded me .
Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was studying here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was theoretical .
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
An epidemic of cancer caused by chemicals in the environment would decrease our lives .
The acid rain fell on our forests .
The desert was about two or three kilometers a day .
The oil was about to run out , and a nuclear winter would give us a grace strike .
Nothing about that happened . ( Laughter ) Incredibly , if you look at what actually happened in my life , average per capita income on the average person on the planet in real terms , updated for inflation is tripled .
The lifespan has extended 30 percent over my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
The per capita food production has gone up by a third .
And in an age where the population has doubled .
How did we get this — it looks pretty good to you .
How did we get this ?
How did we become the only species that gets richer when it gets more populous ?
The bandwidth here represents the size of the population , and the scale of the graph represents GDP per capita .
I think to answer that question , we need to first understand how humans can unite their brains so that their ideas combine more times to meet and , even , to mate .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we got to do things like this .
They &apos;re both real objects .
One is a hand axe half a million years ago a typical maneuverage of Homo erectus .
The other is , of course , a computer mouse .
The size and shape are incredibly similar .
I tried to figure out what &apos;s bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
They &apos;re both modeled on the shape of the human hand .
They &apos;re both technologies , but the similarity we &apos;re interested in very little .
It just tells us that they &apos;re both made for the human hand .
What I &apos;m interested in is differences . The one on the left was the same for about a million years — from a million and a half years ago until half a million years ago .
Homo erectus used the same tool for 30,000 generations .
There were some modifications , of course , but then utensils changed slowly than skeletons .
There was no progress and no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
But the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
There &apos;s another difference , the object on the left is made of one substance .
The one on the right is made of a series of different materials , including silicon , metal , plastic and so on .
And most importantly , it &apos;s a product of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of laser , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;re combined with this technology .
It &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , which intrigues me . I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also a accumulation of ideas , the idea of epidermal cellular , brain , liver .
They got together .
How does evolution accumulate and combine things ?
Let &apos;s say it uses sexual reproduction .
In a species that has two mutations in different creatures , a red and a green , they have to be better than the other .
One extends and the other survives .
But in a sexualized species , it &apos;s possible that an individual inherited both mutations from different inherited lines .
So sex allows the individual to take care of the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not limited to an inherited line alone .
What is the process that has the same effect in cultural evolution of what has sex in biological evolution ?
The answer is exchange , the habit of trading one thing for another .
Humans only do it .
No other animal does that .
We can teach them in the lab to make little exchanges , and in others there &apos;s a reciprocity , but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s ever seen a dog exchanging a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There can be culture even without exchanges .
You can have a culture that is asexual .
The chimps , the horses , these creatures have their culture .
They teach each other traditions that have then passed to the offspring .
Here we see chimps teaching others how to open the beds with stones .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , they don &apos;t grow up , they don &apos;t accumulate , they don &apos;t combine with each other . The reason is that , you know , there &apos;s no sex , there &apos;s no exchange of ideas .
Every branch of chimpanzees has a different culture .
There are no ideas exchanges between the different branches .
Why would the exchange increase the quality of life ?
One answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
Here &apos;s a Pietra-Age version of it , although he put it in terms of economic exchanges .
Adam takes four hours to make a rocket and three to reach an ax .
Oz takes an hour to do a launch and two hours for an ax .
So , Oz is better than Adam is to make spears than he asks .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
It can have spears and leaves on its own .
Well , actually , no , because if you think about it if Oz does two strokes and Adame does two strands , and then they trade each of them , they &apos;ll save an hour of work .
And the more they do it this way , the more it will be true , because the more Adam will do that , and the more Adam will improve in making spears and Oz in making langes .
The benefits of trade can only increase .
And one of the great things about exchanges is that one of them creates the impulse for a greater specialization , which creates the impulse for other exchanges and so on .
Adam and Oz both spare an hour of time .
Privity is time saving to satisfy their needs .
Ask yourself how much you should work to get an hour of light to read a book this evening .
If you start from scratch , you go to the country for example .
Find a sheep . You kill it . You take the fat .
You work it . You make a candle , etc .
How long does it take ? A lot .
How long do you have to work to buy an hour of light for your readers if you earn a median wage in Britain ?
The answer is : half a second .
In the 1950s , you had to work eight seconds , with an average paycheck to buy the same light .
You &apos;ve gained seven and a half seconds of prosperity from 1950 , so to say , it &apos;s seven and a half seconds to do something else , or buy other goods or services .
In 1880 , it would take 15 minutes to earn , on average , that light .
In 1800 , you had to work six hours to earn a candle for an hour of light .
The average person with an average paycheck in 1800 couldn &apos;t afford a candle .
Let &apos;s go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who made them and who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by a person for themselves .
It &apos;s a case of self-sufficiency .
Today we call it poverty .
But the object on the right was done for me by other people .
How many of these other people were ?
Decine ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
Millions , actually .
It needs to be included by the people who grew the coffee ready for the man on the oil platform , and the people who drilled out looking for the oil from which you make the plastic , etc .
They all worked for me to make a mouse for me .
Companies work like this .
This is what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
In the old days , if you were rich , you had people working for you .
That &apos;s how they got rich ; they gave jobs to others .
Luigi XIV had a lot of people working for him .
They were singing for him these dumb completions , like this . ( Laughter ) And they were preparing his stupid concoctions or anything .
He had 498 people who were cooking dinner every night .
Even a tourist today who visited Versailles &apos;s building and looks at the paintings of Ray XIV will have 498 people ready to serve him for dinner .
They &apos;re in bistrot , coffee and restaurants and all over Paris stores , and they &apos;re ready to serve you an excellent dinner with a high-quality warning ear probably better than the ones that ate XIV .
That &apos;s because everyone works for others .
We specialize and exchanges and so we elevate the quality of other people &apos;s lives .
Even animals sometimes work for other animals .
Ants are a classic example : workers work for queens and vice versa .
But the big difference is that this only happens within a colony .
Ants don &apos;t cooperate between one colony and the other .
The reason for that is reproductive division of work .
They specialize in reproductive camp .
The queen does everything .
We don &apos;t like that in our species .
The thing we insist on doing on our own is reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England . We don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
( Applause ) When did this habit start ?
How long has that been ? What does that mean ?
I think the oldest version of this is the division of work for sexes .
But I don &apos;t have the evidence .
It seems to me that the first thing we decided was to get men to work for the woman and the woman to the man .
In hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a division of the work between men hunting and women gathering .
It &apos;s not always that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that both sides benefit from it .
The woman knows this , in the case of the Hadzas that we see here — they extract roots to exchange for meat — she knows that in order to have protein she just has to extract some root and exchange it for meat .
She doesn &apos;t have to be an aesuating hunt and try to kill a wild pig .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to dig in order to get roots .
It just has to make sure that when it kills a pig it &apos;s big enough to be shared .
The two sides elevated the quality of life on the other through the labor score for success .
When did that happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals did differently .
They were a very collaborative species .
Very clever species .
Their brain was bigger than mine and yours , than anyone in this room today .
They were imaginative . They were buried their dead .
They probably spoke a language we know that they had the FOX P2 gene , like us . It was discovered here in Oxford .
It turns out they had language skills .
They were brilliant people . I don &apos;t want to talk about Neanderthals .
But there are no traces of their division of work for sexes .
There &apos;s no evidence that women worked on crops .
It turns out they were participating with men .
And then there &apos;s no evidence that there were tradeoffs between different groups , because the objects that we find between the remains of Neanderthals , the tools that they built were always made out of local materials .
For example , in Caucasus , there &apos;s a dig where there are Neanderthals utensils .
They &apos;re always made of local silicon .
In the valley there are also modern human remains of the same time , 30,000 years ago . Some of these are local silicon stone , but many other utensils are made of dioxide that was very far away .
When humans begin to transport objects this way , it &apos;s clear that they were sharing products between groups .
Both are 10 times larger than agriculture .
People forget and think that commerce is a modern thing .
Both of these groups have been around for 100,000 years .
The first traces are between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa when we see dioxide and diaspora and everything else moves for long distances in Ethiopia .
We also find shells — and the thing was discovered by researchers in Oxford — who moved 125 miles into the air from the Mediterranean coast in Algeria .
And this shows that people had started exchanges between different groups .
And that led to specialization .
How do you know that movements on long distances indicate exchanges and non-migration ?
We look at modern hunter-gatherers , aborigens taking stones to make faces in a place called Monte Isa , which was a mine from the Kalkadoon tribe .
They would trade them with their neighbors for other things , like the Pastinaca arrows . The consequence was that the stone arrows ended a little bit in Australia .
The displacement of tools over long distances is a sign of trade , not migration .
What happens if you stop a people from exchanges , and you can specialize ?
And the answer is , not only do you slow down technological advances , but you trigger the reverse .
One example : Tasmanian .
The sea level stood up 10,000 years ago Tasmanian became an island , and that people not only had the experience of progressing more slowly than people on land , but they even found themselves backwards .
They lost the ability to produce bone utensils and fisheries and dressing materials because the population of about 4,000 people simply wasn &apos;t enough to maintain these specialized techniques necessary to keep technologies that they already had .
If people in this room were put on a desert island .
How many objects in your pockets would we still know that we could produce in 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen in the Earth of Fuoco — a similar island , a similar population .
Why ? Fuoco Earth is separated from South America from a much more subtle stroke . There were always tradeoffs of trade across the road for 10,000 years .
The Tasmanian people were isolated .
Let &apos;s go back to this image and ask yourself not only who did it and who did it , but also : who knew how to build it ?
The stone band . The man who built it knew how to do it .
But who knows how you build a computer mouse ?
No one , really .
No one on this planet can make a computer mouse .
I mean , seriously .
The president of the company who does the mouse doesn &apos;t know how to do one .
It just knows how to make the company work .
The person at the assembly line doesn &apos;t sail it , because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill a pool of oil to find oil and make plastic , etc .
Every one of us knows a little bit about things , but nobody knows everything .
I &apos;m quoting a famous essay by Leonard Reed , who was an economist in the 1950s called &quot; &quot; Me , Matita , &quot; &quot; in which he talked about how a pencil is produced , and how no one knows how to make a pencil , because the assembly cannot extract the graphite cannot cut the trees and so on .
What we &apos;ve done in human society through exchange and specialization has been creating the ability to produce things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the way the spoken language is .
With language , we have to transfer ideas that we understand .
But with technology , we can build things far beyond our ability .
We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary level .
By the way , that &apos;s why I don &apos;t care about the Quient Intelligence debate , which group has more than others .
I find that utterly irrelevant .
The thing that I recommend for society is how people can communicate their ideas , and how much they can cooperate , not how smart they are as individuals .
We created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just nodes in this network .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the exchange of ideas the meeting and the mating of ideas among them that is causing technological progress incrementally , a piece at a time .
It can also happen ugly things .
And in the future , as we move forward , we will have certainly terrible experiences .
There will be wars and depressions ; there will be natural disaster .
Things will happen in this century , I &apos;m sure .
But it &apos;s also this , because of the contacts that people create with each other because of the ability of ideas to meet and mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will make great progress , and therefore the quality of life .
Because of this cloud , external collaborations , this underlying world that we &apos;ve created , where not only elites , but everybody can have their ideas and meet and mate and accelerate the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

Good afternoon .
My name is Uldus .
I &apos;m a Russian photographer .
I started my career six years ago with ironical self-portraits at the end of revealing all kinds of stereotypes about nationality , about gender , and on social issues , &#91; I &apos;m streams . I &apos;m selling drugs , guns , pore with children ! &#93; &#91; Vodka = water . I love vodka ! &#93; ( Laughter ) using photography to send a message . &#91; Sposami , I need to see a Wonder and I still look at Wonder cameras .
I focus on addressing a meaningful , aesthetic message , beauty , composition , a little bit of irony and artifacts .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about my project , which is called Desperate Romantics .
These are my artifacts , or paintings of England of preraffaelites , half the 19th century .
I took the paintings and enriched them with a new , contemporary meaning , talking about issues surrounding me in Russia , imposing people who are not models but have an interesting story .
This guy is a professional dancer , he &apos;s only 12 years old , but at school , he &apos;s hiding his passion and wearing the mask of brutality , trying to stay united with the rest of his classmates just like a tall soldier who has no personality .
But this kid has goals and dreams that hide to be accepted by society , because being different is not easy , especially in Russia .
The next interpretation of the painting is metaphorical .
This is Nikita , a legal guard of a pub in St. Petersburg .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t like you when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting a Hulk joke , but I never saw him angry .
He shares his sensitivity and his romantic side , because in Russia , among kids , it &apos;s not good to be romantic , while it &apos;s being surrounded by women and seem like a aggressive Hulk .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I take the painting and I give it a new meaning and a new insider .
Sometimes , they compare facial features and play with words : irony , Iron Man , man stirring .
( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues , which surround me in Russia &apos;s conversations .
One interesting thing about the Russian marriage is that most 18-19 girls are already ready , dream of married .
They teach us from childhood that a successful marriage is equal to a successful life , so many girls struggle to have a good husband .
What about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
For Russian society , I &apos;m an old joke that has no hope to marry .
That &apos;s why you see me with a Mexican struggling mask , in a wedding suit , desperate in my garden .
But remember , the key is irony , and it &apos;s made to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and to change stereotypes .
Be brave . Be ironic , it helps .
Be creative and create magic .

My name is Amit .
18 months ago , I had another job at Google , but I launched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s here in the room , and she gave me permission to do it .
It took 18 months .
Many negotiations and funny stories , I assure you , with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries .
But I want to focus on demo .
There are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve created this .
I think my personal story is explained in a simple way in the slide , and it &apos;s access .
I grew up in India .
I got a wonderful education — I didn &apos;t slow down — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these works of art .
So when I started traveling and visiting these museums , I began to learn a lot .
And during my work at Google , I tried to bring technology together this desire to make them more accessible .
So we formed a team , a team of great people , and we started doing it .
It &apos;s better to start the presentation and then tell you a couple of interesting events that happened after the launch .
So , simple : go on googleartproject.com.
Take a look at all the museums there .
Find the Uffizers , find MoMA , Hermitage , Rijks , Van Gogh .
Now I &apos;m going to enter one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
There are two ways to go in — very simple .
Click and , boom , you &apos;re in the museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
Go around and have fun .
Do you want to move to the museum halls ?
Open the map , and , on a click , jump .
You &apos;re here , you want to go to the other end of the corridor .
Keep going . Be happy .
Explorate .
( Applause ) Thank you . But I haven &apos;t come to the best part yet .
( Laughter ) Now I stand in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Mietors &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
I see this sign more .
If the museum gave us the image , you can click on it .
Here &apos;s one of the images .
Here &apos;s all the supplementary information .
Those who are really passionate about art can click here , but for the moment I make it disappear .
This is one of the images we made with a technology called gigapixel .
This image , for example , is comprised of about 10 billion pixels .
And many people ask me , &quot; What do you do about 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
I want to try and show you what you can do with 10 billion pixels .
You can zoom in very easily .
As you can see , funny things happen .
I love this guy ; his expression is unpaid .
But I really want to go deep .
I started playing a little bit , and I found something on this side .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Wait . Looks interesting . &quot; &quot; And I got bigger , and I realized that actually these kids are just running something .
I did some research , I spoke to a couple of people at the Met , and I finally found that this is a game called &quot; &quot; Squail , &quot; &quot; which was practicing by taking a drink in the day of Tuesday Grace .
It looks like it was very popular .
I have no idea why it was , but I learned something about it .
Now we really zoom in , we can actually get to the cracks .
Now , to give you a little perspective , I &apos;m going to go away and really show you what this is .
This is where we were before , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) But the best one still has to come , give me a second .
Now let &apos;s fast-forward to MoMA , again in New York .
Another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; Stelled Night . &quot; &quot; The example I just showed you was all focused on detail .
But what if you wanted to see the paintbrushes ?
What if someone wanted to see how Van Gogh actually created his masterpiece ?
Zoom . You really go deep .
Now I get to one of my favorite points in the painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks in the paint .
This is Stelled Night , I think , as you &apos;ve never seen .
I want to show you my other favorite function .
There are many other functions , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the really cool part . It &apos;s called Collessons .
Any of you , any of you , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , if you have a bad home — it doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your museum online , create your collection with all these images .
Very simply , you enter — I created this called the Zoom Power — and you can look around .
This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; at the National Gallery .
You can write notes , send them to your friends and start talking about what you &apos;re thinking about as you get around these masterpieces .
I think , in closing , the most important thing for me is that all these wonderful things don &apos;t all come from Google .
They don &apos;t come , in my opinion , even from museums .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t say that .
They come from artists .
This was my enlightening experience .
I mean , I hope that with this digital medium , we can actually make justice to their artwork and represent them online as they deserve .
The most important question I &apos;m asked about these days is , &quot; &quot; Did you do all this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to expand that experience .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a storyteller .
This is what I do , I tell stories about history , writing fiction , and today I want to tell you a little bit about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called djinni .
But before we get there , let me share some strips of my personal history .
I &apos;m going to do it with the help of words , of course , but also with a geometric shape : the circle . So during this talk , you &apos;re going to go through some circles .
I was born in Strasburgh in France by Turkish parents .
Shortly after that , my parents separated , and I moved to Turkey with my mom .
From then on , I was raised as a single mother &apos;s only daughter .
In the early 1970s , in Ankara , this was a little unusual .
In our neighborhood there were a lot of great families , where fathers were family hair , so I grew up seeing my mother being divorced in a patriarchal environment .
In fact , I grew up looking at two ways of being a woman .
On the one hand , there was my mother , an educated , secular , modern , Western woman .
On the other hand , there was my grandmother , who was also involved with me , and she was more spiritual , less educated and much less rational .
She was a woman reading the coffee funds to predict the future and she founded the lead in mysterious forms to keep the evil looks away .
A lot of people were visiting my grandmother , people with heavy facial acne or rustles on their hands .
Every time , my grandmother would whisper a few words in Arabic , take a red apple and she would ruin it with a lot of rose spines how many of the vegetables she wanted to remove .
Then one by one , he would look for the shoulders with the dark ink .
After a week , the patient would come back for a little bit of control .
I &apos;m aware that I shouldn &apos;t talk about this kind of thing in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is that among all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin diseases , I never saw anybody go for granted or not recovered .
I asked her how she did . Was she the power of the prayer ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Yes , prayer is effective . But you are also conscious of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; And from her , I learned in other things , a really precious lesson , that if you want to destroy something in this life , whether it &apos;s acne , an imperfection or human soul , the only thing to do is to surround it with thick walls .
It &apos;s going to dry out of the inside .
We all live in a kind of social and cultural circle .
We all do that .
We leave in a family detergation , nation , class .
But if we don &apos;t have any kind of connection with worlds beyond the world that we take for granted , then we also run the risk of secreting from the inside .
Our imagination could shrink . Our hearts could get smaller , and our humanity would aspire if we &apos;re too long in our cultural cocoons .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family , if all the people in our inner circle look like us , means we &apos;re surrounded by our specular image .
Another thing that women like my grandmother do in Turkey is to cover the mirrors with poisoners or hang them on the wall with the side behind them .
It &apos;s an ancient Eastern tradition based on consciousness that it &apos;s not healthy for a human to spend too much time staring at their image .
Ironically , living in communities of people who think about it as we are one of the greatest threats in the global world today .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere , between liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , both in the West and the East .
We tend to form groups based on similarities , and we create stereotypes on other groups of people .
For me , a way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
Stories can &apos;t break down borders , but they can holes in our mental walls .
And through these holes , we can see each other , and sometimes what we see we also like .
I started writing fiction for eight years .
My mother came home one day with a turchese cousin and asked me if I would be interested in keeping a personal dictionary .
And when I think about it , I think it was slightly concerned about my mental health .
I was always telling stories at home , which was fine , except I told my imaginary friends , which wasn &apos;t fine .
I was an introverted child at the point I talked to colored pencils and apologize to the objects I screamed for wrong , so my mother thought it would make me feel good to write about my everyday experiences and emotions .
What he didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was write about me .
Instead , I started writing about people who were not me and things that had never happened .
So he began the passion of a life in writing fiction .
So in principle , the narrative for me was not as much a autobiographical manifestation as a transcendent journey to other lives , other possibilities .
And have a little patience for me . I &apos;m going to draw a circle and I &apos;m going to come back to that .
Another thing happened at this time .
My mother became a diplomat .
So from this little , superstitious Dutch neighborhood of my grandmother , I was projected in this luxurious international school in Madrid , where I was the only Turk .
It was where I had my first meeting with what I call the &quot; &quot; foreign representative . &quot; &quot; In our class , there were children of all nationality , but this diversity didn &apos;t necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , elite democracy in the classroom .
Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which every child was seen , not as an individual itself , but as a representative of something larger .
We were like the U.N. in miniature , which was fun , except when something negative about a nation or religion happened .
The child who represented was buried , ridiculed endlessly by bullets .
And I know this well , because over the time I spent in that school , there was a military coup in my country , an armed man of my own nearly killed Pope and Turkey got zero as a score on the Eurofestival contest .
( Laughter ) I would often jump out of school and dream of becoming a puppeteer during those days .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes .
The other kids asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I hadn &apos;t seen , and they asked me how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all the Turks were great smokers , and they were wondering how old I was going to start covering my boss .
I learned that these were the three main stereotypes about my country , politics , cigarettes and veil .
After Spain , we went to Jordan in Germany and back to Ankara .
Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could carry with me .
The stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big C I otherwise had no idea .
By the age of twenty-five , I moved to Instanbul , the city I love .
I lived in a very vivid , vary neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake was in &apos; 99 .
When I walked out of the building at three o &apos;clock in the morning , I saw something that made me stop .
There was local drugs , an elderly scrutinize that didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t talk to the marginalized .
He was sitting next to an underdog wearing a long black parrucca , and his mask would hit her on the heels .
I saw the man opening a package of cigarettes with his shaky hands and offering him one , and this is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today , a conservative drug and an underdog who cried that they smoked together on the sidewalk .
In the drama of destruction and death , our mondane differences evaporated , and we became one of them even though only for a few hours .
But I always believed that stories have similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not saying that storytelling has the same magnitude as an earthquake , but when we &apos;re reading a beautiful novel , we &apos;re leaving our little apartments behind , and we &apos;re leaving ourselves in the night and we &apos;re beginning to learn about people we never met before and maybe even whose biases we had .
Shortly after that , I went to a female university in Boston in Michigan .
I &apos;ve lived it not as much as a change in place but as a language .
I started writing fiction in English .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile . They ask me why I do this , but the pendulum between language gives me a chance to recreate myself .
I love writing in Turkish , which is very poetic and emotional for me , and I love writing in English , which is very mathematical and celebral for me .
I feel connected to both languages in different ways .
For me , as for millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
When you learn a language late , what happens and you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
As the last few years , we always want to say more , have better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a space between the mind and the language .
And that space is frightening .
But if we can &apos;t be afraid , it &apos;s also inspiring .
And this is what I found in Boston , that frustration was very stimulating .
At this point , my grandmother , who had been looking at me during the time of my life with increasing anxiety , began to include in her daily prayers the fact that I would marry myself as soon as I could fix myself once for all .
And because God loves her , I really married me .
( Laughter ) But instead of fixing me , I went to Arizona .
And because my husband is in Istanbul , I started moving between Arizona and Istanbul , two places on Earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
I think a part of me will always be nomadic , physically and spiritually .
The stories accompanied me , holding together the fragments of my memories , like an esitential glue .
But as much as I like stories , I recently started to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen for more than what it is .
And this is the subject I would like to think about with you .
When my first novel in English came out of America , it felt an interesting point from a literary critic .
&quot; I like your book , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; But I want you to write it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what that meant .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well look at it . There are so many Spanish , American and Hispanic characters , but there &apos;s only one tourist character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; The novel is set in a university campus in Boston , so it was common for me that there were more international characters than Turkish , but I understood what the critic meant .
And I also realized that I would continue to disappoint it .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
He wanted a Turkey woman in the book because that was what I was .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of political identity affects the way the stories circulate , are read and recensed .
Many authors feel this pressure , but the non-Western authors feel this most .
For a woman writer from a Muslim world , like me , the expectation is that I write stories of Muslim women potentially , unhappy stories of Muslim women .
The expectation is that it writes information and pertinent stories and it leaves experimentation and cutting-edge to Western colleagues .
What I lived in that school in Madrid as a child is happening in the literary world today .
The writers are not seen as creatives themselves , but as representatives of their own cultures , some authors from China , some from Turkey , some from Nigeria .
They teach us to have something really distinctive , if not special .
The writer and commuter , James Baldwin , released an interview from 1984 where he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
When the interviewer tried to stumble him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; Do you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that there &apos;s nothing in all other people , and nothing in others that isn &apos;t in me . &quot; &quot; When political identity tries to tag us , it &apos;s our freedom to the imagination that is in danger .
There &apos;s a kind of ambiguous category , called multicultural literature where all authors who don &apos;t belong to the Western world are gathered together .
I will never forget my first multicultural public reading in Harvard square 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one from the Philippines , a Turk and an Indonesian , like a joke .
( Laughter ) And the reason we were put together was not because we had the same style or literary taste .
It was for our passports .
You expect multicultural writers to tell real stories , not so much of the imagery .
It &apos;s attributed a function to narrative .
So not just the authors themselves , but their characters also become the representatives of something larger .
But I have to quickly add that this trend in seeing in a story more than one story doesn &apos;t come from the other .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And that &apos;s when I first experienced it when I was processed in 2005 for the words that a character of mine said in a novel .
I wanted to write a constructive , multi-faceted novel about a monthly family and a Turk through a woman &apos;s gaze .
My little story became a huge problem when the process was there .
Some people criticized me , some people praised me for writing about turcoarless conflict .
But there were occasions where I wanted to remember the chamber the parts that were a novel .
It was just a story .
And when I say &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to undermine my work .
I want to love and celebrate the literature for what it is , not as a means for an end .
The writers have a right to have their political opinions , and there are great political novels , but the language of narrative is not the language of everyday politics .
Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the best way to ask the question is two totally different things .
And just that last one is the responsibility of the writer . &quot; &quot; Political identity divides us . The narrative unites .
One is interested in getting rid of generalizations .
The other one in the nuances .
It &apos;s a boundary .
The other one recognizes frontiers .
Political identity is made up of solid bricks .
The narrative is water flowing .
During the Otoman empire , there were stories of itinerant stories called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They went to the coffee room , where they told stories in public , often improvising .
For every protagonist in history , the meddah changed the rustle of voice , giving him a personality .
Everybody could go to listen , ordinary people , even sultan , Muslims and not .
Stories cross borders , like the stories of Nasreddin Hodja , who were very popular across the Middle East , North Africa , Balkans and Asia .
Today stories continue to transcend borders .
When Palestinian politicians and Israeli politicians talk , they don &apos;t usually listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader read the same novel as a Jewish writer , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the storyteller .
Literature has to take us there .
If it can &apos;t take us there , it &apos;s not good literature .
The books saved the introvert , shy child I was once .
But I &apos;m also conscious of the danger that there is to make it a beetle .
When the poet and mystical , Rumi , met his spiritual partner , Shams from Tabriz , one of the first things Shams did was he threw Rumi &apos;s books into the water and he was watching the dissolved words .
The Sufi say , &quot; &quot; The knowledge that brings you not beyond you is much worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with cultural ghetto today is not the lack of knowledge . We know a lot about us , or so we believe . But the knowledge that leads us not beyond ourselves , makes us elitists , distant and connected .
There &apos;s a metaphor that I love : living as a drawing compass .
As you know , a leg of the compass is static , fixed in a place .
And the other leg draws a large circle , moving constantly .
What I write is like compass .
One part is fixed in Istanbul with strong tourist roots , but the other side travels around the world , connecting to different cultures .
So in this sense , I like to think that my writing is local and universal at the same time , from here and from all parts .
Those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen the Topkbee building , which was the residence of the Otoman sultans for over 400 years .
In the palazzo , right outside the favorite rabbit district , there &apos;s a place called Djinn &apos;s meeting .
It &apos;s found in buildings .
This concept intrigues me .
We don &apos;t usually trust those souls , which are between things .
We perceive them as the domain of supernatural creatures like djinn , which are made of fire without smoke and are the symbol of elusivity .
But my point is maybe the elusive space is what the writers need most .
When I write a narrative , elusivity and mutability are at heart .
I don &apos;t like to know what &apos;s going to happen 10 pages later .
I love when my characters surprise me .
I could write about a Muslim woman in a novel , and maybe it &apos;s going to be a really joyful story , and in my next book I could write about a beautiful gay professor in Norway .
Until our hearts come from , we can write about everything and everything .
Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The West fathers taught us to say , &quot; &quot; I think they are . &quot; &quot; She proposed , &quot; &quot; I have feelings so I &apos;m free . &quot; &quot; I think that was a fantastic paradigm shift .
But nonetheless , as ever in creative writing classes today , the first thing we teach students is to write what you know ?
Maybe that &apos;s not the right way to start .
Imagination literature is not necessary to write about what we are and what we know or what our identity is .
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write about our feelings .
We should go out of our cultural ghetto and visit the next one and the next one .
Eventually the stories move like rotating deviss , drawing circle after circle .
By connecting all of humanity , not looking for political identity , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I &apos;d like to end with an old sufi poem . &quot; &quot; Come on , we &apos;re friends for once ; we make life easy for us ; we become lovers and loved ; the earth won &apos;t stay with anyone . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

My name is Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a video game player .
We get more results in online worlds .
That &apos;s why , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
We &apos;re evolving to collaborate more and to have more heart .
As a result , we really have more robust social relationships .
Five million people use it every month .
This is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
His studies are brilliant . He &apos;s studying why .
But it &apos;s not , in any way , an ideal situation .
We need to start making the real world more like a game .
Before we had joysticks and amazing buttons , we had sheep bones .
People were suffering , people were facing .
This is quite interesting .
According to Erodoto , after 18 years , the king decided they were going to play a last dice game .
We want to imagine epic victories and then give people the tools to make them .
We made this game in 2007 .
This is an incredible story ! It &apos;s an adventure you can participate in .
There &apos;s a comic book story , it &apos;s increasing by skills like local knowledge , collaboration , sustainability , imagination and inventive .
The crew of Dirty Jobs and I were invited to a small Colorado country called Craig .
It &apos;s only 62 square kilometers , and it &apos;s on the Rocciose Mountains .
And the work in question was the sheep farmer .
My role in the show , for those who haven &apos;t seen it , is quite simple .
I &apos;m an apprentice and I work with people who really do business as a matter of fact .
And my duties are simply trying to learn and make honest assessment of what these people are for a day in their lives .
The work in question : Fold sheep . Great !
Let &apos;s go to Creig and record us in a hotel , and I realize the next day that the castration will be the absolute part of this work .
So normally , I don &apos;t do any research at all .
But this is a delicate subject , and I work for Discovery Channel , and we want to depict everything we do , and we want to make sure that we do it with a lot of respect for animals .
So I called Hhuman Society and I said , &quot; &quot; Look , I mean , I mean , I want to castrate some of the sticks . Could you explain what to do ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah , that &apos;s pretty trivial . &quot; &quot; And they use a lift , basically an elastic lift , like this , just a little bit smaller .
This was actually around the game cards that I received yesterday , but it had an undoubtedly resemblance with that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the procedure ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The appeal is applied to the tail in a narrow way .
And then another fascination is applied to the crust , narrow .
The blood flow is slowly retarded , and a week after the parts of the matter disconnect .
&quot; Great ! Got it all ! &quot;
All right , I call SPCA to get confirmation , they confirm .
I also call PETA just for fun . They don &apos;t like it , but they confirm .
Okay , this is basically how you do it .
So the next German day .
And I &apos;m given a horse and we go and take the sticks and we bring them into a fence that we built and we start this farm stuff .
Melanie is the wife of Albert .
Albert is the shepherd of history .
Melanie lifts the needle — two hands — one hand with both legs on the right , in the same way on the left .
The agle goes to the station , she soils it up .
All right , big .
Albert enters , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
I always look at the procedure I did the first time before I tried it .
As an apprentice , you know , you do .
Albert links his hand in his pocket to pull out , you can imagine , this elastic black pot , but what comes out is a serpanic knife .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Mmmm — that &apos;s not elastic at all ! &quot; &quot; You can imagine it .
And he took the blade out in a way that captured the sun that was right at that moment reaching the Rocciose Mountains . It was very — it was impressive .
Within two seconds , Albert had the knife in the middle of the tail cartilage , right next to the front of the agel , and very quickly the tail had gone and inside the bucket that I was holding with my hands .
And a second later , with a big thumb and a beautiful index callosum , he had a steam firmly in his grasp .
And he pulled it to himself , in this way , took the blade and put it on the end .
Now you think you know what &apos;s going to happen , Michael . No , you don &apos;t know ! OK .
He cuts it , he grabs the end over his shoulders , and then he grabs the scrotum and he pushes it up and then his head goes down into the darkness of my sighted , but what I hear is the sound of a suck and a noise that sounds like Velcro hanging out of a sticky wall , and I &apos;m not even kidding .
Can we send the video ?
No , I &apos;m joking , we don &apos;t . ( Laughter ) I thought it &apos;d be better to discuss it with images .
So , I do something I &apos;ve never done and then done in Dirty Jobs &apos; footage . Never .
I say , &quot; &quot; Pause . Stop . &quot; &quot; You all know the show , we just do one blind , we don &apos;t do a second shot .
There &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no absurdity .
We don &apos;t play , we don &apos;t make evidence , we turn what happens !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is crazy . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know what I mean .
( Laughter ) This is crazy .
We can &apos;t do that . And Albert says , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened but there are testes in this bucket , and this is not how we do things . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even allowed him to clarify , &quot; And I do it Society . &quot;
We do something that doesn &apos;t make it tightly and bleed the needle . We &apos;re on five continents &apos; television , good !
We go up twice a day on Discovery Channel , we can &apos;t do this ! &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; He goes to his cassette and he pulls out a envelope of these little elastic fibers .
Melanie raises another agel , puts it on the station , a fascination goes around the tail , a slice goes around the rot .
The agle comes back to the ground , the agle takes two steps , falls , gets up , drill a little bit , takes another couple of steps , falls down .
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; This is not a good symptom for the needle at all .
It gets up , it goes to the corner , it &apos;s shaking and it &apos;s catching up and it &apos;s obvious suffering .
And I look at the agle and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how much ?
When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; One day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; One day ! How long does it take to stay apart ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
Meanwhile , the agle that had just suffered the little surgery is , you can imagine , he &apos;s shrinking . The spine was over .
He &apos;s , you can imagine , continuing to crack some grass , jumping around .
And I was so shocked by how completely I was in that instant .
I was reminded how completely wrong I am for most of the time .
( Laughter ) And it struck me in particular how unpleasant I was doing that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are 100 of these magnets in the fence , and all of a sudden this story is beginning to appear like a German porn , and I &apos;m like , Melanie used the paintbrush , put it on the setting , he couples .
Albert passes my knife .
Inside , the tail is gone .
By the way , I claim the escape , the end is gone .
Albert gives instructions , &quot; &quot; Push up . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; Feel more . &quot;
I do .
The testes emerge , they look like thumbs , prosthetics toward you , and he says , &quot; &quot; You die .
Just squeeze away with a bite . &quot; &quot; And I heard that , I heard all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how did I get here ?
&quot; How ? &quot; &quot; you know , I mean , &quot; How did I get here ? &quot;
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just , it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes by itself , and suddenly , I &apos;m there , on the Ricky Mountains , and all I can think of is the aristotelical definition of tragedy .
You know , Aristotle says that tragedy is that moment when hero comes to face with his real identity .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this metaphor out of place ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that view out of my view , so I did what I had to do .
I went in and I broke them .
I took them this way , and I grabbed my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t catch up , I can &apos;t scroll through the metaphor .
Okay , I &apos;m still in the poet , Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking , from nothing — two terms come to shrink in my head that I hadn &apos;t heard since my Greek and Latin professor in college fired them .
And these are : anagnorisis and peripeteia .
Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
Literally , transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
What our TV network does , is what Dirty Jobs is .
And I find myself up to the neck in anagnorisis every single day .
Great .
The other word : peripeteia . This is the moment in the great tragedies , you know , Euripid and Sofocle , the moment that Edipo has his moment , where he understands that the beautiful puppet he &apos;s been in bed with and he &apos;s done his children is his mother . OK .
This is periphia or peripeteia .
And this metaphor in my head , I have anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , it &apos;s a great stratagem anyway .
When you start looking for peripeteia , you find it everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in the &quot; &quot; Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
He takes the whole movie trying to help the little kid see dead people , and then , boom , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; Perieteia .
Remember ?
It &apos;s intense when the audience sees it in the right way .
Not in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; remember ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s overwhelming .
These discoveries that lead to improvisational purposes , and I &apos;ve had them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one , has solicited my mind in a way that I wasn &apos;t prepared for .
And , while I was standing there , looking at the happy agel that — you know , I had just perfected , but it seemed OK .
Looking at that other poor creature that I had treated in the right way , and I was really impressed by thinking , &quot; If I &apos;m in the cake on this , if I &apos;m in the cake so often , literally , what other misconceptions could I be able to comment ? &quot;
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who is .
And I talk to him !
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey , Mike .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your mind is interested in this kind of thing , but you realize that you &apos;ve made documentary films in all circumstances ?
You worked in the mine , you worked in fishing , you worked in steel , you worked in every major industry .
You &apos;ve been pushed to shoulder with these people that our politicians don &apos;t wait to relate to each four years . Right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary make the little whiskey buns of segal , chilling on his chin , with the metalactics .
I mean , this is the people I work with every single day .
And if you had something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
Because , buddy , you know , four years old . So , this is in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts bounce around .
And after that shot , Dirty Jobs didn &apos;t really change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me personally .
And now , when I talk about the show , I don &apos;t just tell the story that you heard and 190 like this .
I do that , but I also start talking about some of the other things that I misunderstood , some of the other notions about the work that I thought was sacred so far , and I &apos;m not .
People who do dirty work are happier than you think .
As a group , they are the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to begin to whistle the ritoral of the advertising &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label &quot; &quot; and all those crawled on the happy worker .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people doing unthinkable work .
The gatherers of the carcasses of animals killed on the street whistled as they work , I swear to God . I did it with them .
They have this amazing sort of symmetry of their life .
And I see it repeatedly .
So I started wondering what would happen if we challenging some of these dogmas ?
&quot; &quot; Keep your passion . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve talked about it here for the last 36 hours .
&quot; &quot; Keep your passion , &quot; &quot; what could possibly be wrong with that ?
Probably the worst advice I &apos;ve ever had .
( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and fail , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told , if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to be OK .
I can give you 30 examples , now . Bob Combs , a pig farmer from Las Vegas collecting the advancements of uneaten food from casinos and feeding them to his cousins .
Why ? Because there are so many proteins in the stuff that we don &apos;t eat that his pigs grow twice the normal speed , and he &apos;s a rich pig farmer and he &apos;s good for the environment and he &apos;s going to spend his days doing this incredible service , and he &apos;s smell damn , but God bless it .
He &apos;s doing a great life .
You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he would laugh at you .
This is a person worth , they were offered 60 million dollars for their farm and refused them , outside Las Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He took a step back and looked at where everyone was going and he went to the other side .
And I feel that story repeatedly .
Matt Froind , a milk producer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized that the dung of his cows was worth more than their milk , if he used it to make these biodegradable vessels for flowers .
He &apos;s selling them now to Walmart .
He follows his passion , this guy , but let &apos;s go !
So I started looking at passion , and I started to think about efficiency against efficacy , as Tim discussed earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
I started to look at the work of teams and determination , and basically all of those trivial features that they call successories , which are hanging on the walls with that apple art in the boardroom halls around the world right now .
That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly thrilled in his head .
Security — security in the first place .
It &apos;s me coming back , you know , at OSHA and PETA and Hhuman Society . What if OSHA was wrong ?
I mean , this is heresy , what I &apos;m going to say , but what if safety was actually in the third place ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I really say .
What I mean by that is that I value my safety in these crazy jobs as much as the people I &apos;m working with , but the ones that really lead to doing the work , they &apos;re not there to discuss safety in the first place .
They know that other things come first — the whole thing about doing work comes first , the whole thing about getting it to a good end .
And I &apos;ll never forget , in the Bering Sea , I was on a fishing boat with the world &apos;s biggest fishermen , and I worked with in the first season in the program .
We &apos;re about 160 miles off the coast of Russia , a sea that &apos;s 15 meters deep , remarkable waves , green water that reaches the hall , right ?
The risky conditions I &apos;d ever seen , and I was behind a guy , linking together the fish dunes .
I &apos;m suspended at 12 meters from the bridge , which is like looking down the tip of your feet , you can imagine it , and the boat is doing this in the ocean .
Amazingly dangerous .
I slam down , I go into the control cabin , and I say , with some disbelief , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said afterwards can &apos;t be repeated in the continental United States underneath Alaska .
It can &apos;t be repeated in any planning of an industrial facility or any construction site .
But he looked at me and he said , &quot; &quot; Boy ... &quot; &quot; he &apos;s my same age , by the way , he calls me goddddess , this I like — he says , &quot; &quot; Boy , I &apos;m the captain of a fishing boat .
My responsibility is not to bring you alive at home .
My responsibility is to bring you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; Do you want to go home ? That depends on you . &quot;
And for the rest of the day , security in the first place !
I mean , I was like , &quot; &quot; So , the idea that we create this false , this sense of complacency , when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as if it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
Anyway , a lot of things .
I could talk for a long time about many small distinctions that we &apos;ve done and the list without the end of ways that I &apos;ve misunderstood .
But what it &apos;s all about is this .
I &apos;ve formulated a theory , and I want to share it now in two minutes and 30 seconds that remain .
It goes like this — we declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , really .
We haven &apos;t tried to do it , and we haven &apos;t enriched the mustache in a masterpiece way , but we did .
We conducted this war at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we represent people working on television , it &apos;s ridiculous .
If there &apos;s a hydrophobic , it weighs 130 pounds and it has a giant sludge solid , let &apos;s admit it .
You see it all the time .
That &apos;s what hydrophobic looks like , right ?
We make them heroes or make them become zimbels .
This is what television does .
We at Dirty Jobs are striving to not do that , and that &apos;s why I do work and not cheating .
But we did this war in Madison Avenue .
I mean , so many advertising campaigns coming out of there — in the way of a message , what is actually said ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work that hard , if you could get a little bit back , if you could retire a little bit faster , if you could time-stamp the billboard a little bit earlier , it &apos;s all there , continuously , repeatedly .
Washington ! I don &apos;t know where to start discussing the agreements and organized policies that affect the reality of the first line of jobs available because I don &apos;t actually know .
I just know this is a front of this war .
And right here , guys : Silicon Valley . I mean , how many people have an iPhone on it right now ?
How many people have their Blackberry ?
We &apos;re attached to a grasp , we &apos;re connected .
I would never suggest for a second that something bad came out of the technological revolution .
Singing God , not this crowd .
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
And no one celebrates imitation in the way that the guys at Dirty Jobs know that it has to be done .
Your iPhone without those people doing the same interface , the same electrical system , the same printed circuit , repeatedly .
All that — that &apos;s how much it makes it as possible as the geniality that goes inside .
So , we have this new toolbox , you know .
These tools today don &apos;t look like pigs and spikes .
They look like the stuff that we &apos;re walking around with .
And so the collective effect of this was this marginalization of cows and cows of work .
And I understood , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do more than 200 of these things , but we want to do more than we can .
And for me the most important thing to know and to really compare with , is the fact that I &apos;ve misunderstood a lot of things , not just the testicles on my process .
I &apos;ve misunderstood a lot .
So , we &apos;re thinking , thanks to us , I mean , thank you to me that the thing to do is to discuss a promotion campaign in favor of work , manual labor , worker work .
You need somebody out there who has forgotten benefits .
I &apos;m talking about the vision of grandparents . Of that stuff that a lot of us probably grew up with , but we have a little bit , you know , a little lost .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a huge deal .
This war at work , which I believe exists , produces victims like any other war .
Infrastructure is the first one : declining in professional schools is the second one .
Every year , less electricists , less carpenters , less hydrophobic , less saldators , less tubes , less steam pipes .
The infrastructure jobs that everybody talks about creating are those people , the ones that have been decimated , repeatedly .
Meanwhile , we have two trillion dollars , at least , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers , which we need to spend at least leaving a sign in the infrastructure that is currently classified at D — at least .
So , if I were running for a charge , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the work that we hope to do and the cemeteries that we hope to create will not last unless they are jobs that people want .
And I know the topic of this conference is celebrating the things that are close and close to us , but I also know that clean and dirty are not opposed .
It &apos;s two faces of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and accountability , like peripeteia and anagnorisis , like that poor little agel , which I hope is not shaking anymore and like time at my disposal that is over .
It was great to talk to you and come back to work , okay ?
( Applause )
My great idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of great ideas that are , at the moment , latent within us .
And the little idea that will allow us to do that is : sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a women &apos;s room of tipo-A . This is a room .
of women with sleep deficit .
And I learned about my skin , the value of sleep .
Two and a half years ago , I came to grievity .
I broke my head on my desk , fractured my zigom , put five points to my right eye .
And I began the journey of rescover the value of sleep .
And during that journey , I studied . I met doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the path to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is : sleep enough .
( Applause ) And we will be women to step into this new revolution , the new feminist question .
We &apos;re going to get to the top , literally sleeping more .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , for men , sleep lack has become a symbol of virulence .
For a little while , I was having dinner with a man who was bothered to have slept only four hours a night before .
And he came to tell him — but I didn &apos;t tell him — he came to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If I had slept five hours , this dinner would have been much more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a kind of competition going on right now based on the lack of sleep .
Specifically here in Washington , if you try to meet someone for breakfast and say , &quot; &quot; Is it okay to eight ? &quot; &quot; they probably will say , &quot; &quot; 8 a.m. ? It &apos;s a little late for me , but okay , I can do a game in tennis and a couple of calls and then meet you . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they &apos;re tremendous engaged and productive , but that &apos;s good , because we have leaders .
So , high IQ .
It doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is to be able to see the iceberg before the Titanic hits .
And we had too many iceberg that hit our Titanic .
In fact , I have a feeling , that if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Brothers and Sisters , it could still be active .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy being hyperconnected 24 hours on 24 , seven days on 7 , maybe a sister , would have noticed the iceberg , because he would wake up after seven and a half hours of sleep , and he would have been able to have a vision together .
So , as we &apos;re confronting with all the multiple crisis in our world right now , what &apos;s going to do right at our personal level , what &apos;s going to bring us more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and that &apos;s going to be the best for our careers , is also the best thing for the world .
So I urge you to shut down your eyes and discover the big ideas that lie inside us , &#91; invite you to &#93; turn off your motors and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , as Chris said , I study the human brain the functions and structure of the human brain .
And I want you to think for a minute about what this leads .
Here &apos;s a picture of gelatin — a mile and a half of gelatin that you can hold on the palm of your hand and that can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
It can contemplate the sense of infinity and it can contemplate itself as it contemplates the sense of infinity .
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the Holy Grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and one day , we hope , we &apos;ll understand how this happens .
OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
I mean , there are 100 billion nerve cells , little protoplasma offices that interact with each other , and from this activity emerges the entire spectrum of skills that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How does that happen ?
So there are many ways to investigate the functions of the human brain .
One approach , what we adopt primarily , is to study patients who have suffered important damage to a small area of the brain , where there was a genetic modification in a small area of the brain .
What &apos;s happening is not a sudden reduction in all mental skills , a kind of weakening of cognitive abilities .
What happens is that loss is strongly selective in a function as other functions remain intact , and that allows us to say with a certain confidence that that part of the brain is involved in the mediation of that function .
So we can map the function of the structure , and then figure out what the circuit is doing to generate that particular function .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
Let me show you some suggestive examples .
So during this talk I &apos;m going to show you three examples , six minutes each .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
If you look at the first slide , here &apos;s the temporal lobes , the frontal lobes , the parietal lobes , OK , the lobes that make up the brain .
And if you look , hidden inside the inner surface of the temporal lobe — you can &apos;t see it , there &apos;s a little structure called a fusiform tour .
They called it the face area of the brain because when it &apos;s damaged , you don &apos;t recognize people &apos;s faces anymore .
You can still recognize them from the voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , it &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at them in your face and know who it is , right ?
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
I mean , you know you are because if you squeeze the eye , he squeeze it too , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as you are .
OK . Now they know that syndrome is caused by damage to fusiform .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , in fact , so rare that very few doctors , and even neurologists , have never heard of it .
It &apos;s called the Capgras illusion , and that &apos;s a patient who for the rest is completely normal has had a lesion on her head , and she comes out of the coma completely normal throughout the rest , looks at her mother and says , &quot; &quot; This woman looks like my mother , but she &apos;s an imposer .
It &apos;s another woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
How come — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent all the rest of the world , but when he sees his mother , the illusion hits and he says it &apos;s not the mother .
Now , the most common interpretation that is in all psychiatry manual , is a freudian view , and that is that this guy — the same thing is true for women , but I &apos;m just going to talk about men .
When you were a kid , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
This is the so-called freudian Edipo complex .
I &apos;m not saying you believe it , but this is the standard freudian perspective .
Then when you grow up , the cortex develops , and it inhibits these latent sexual pulses to your mother .
Thank God , otherwise all of you would be sexually excited when you see your mother .
And what happens is that you have a stroke on your head , that damages your cortex , and these latent sexual pulsions emerge , come to the surface , suddenly , and without any reason you get sexually excited by your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I get sexually excited ?
It &apos;s a few other women . It &apos;s an entrepreneur . &quot; &quot; This is the only feeling interpretation for your lesbian brain .
This subject has never felt a sense to me .
It &apos;s very ingenious , like all freudian arguments — ( Laughter ) — but it never seemed very sensible to me because I saw the same illusion in a patient with the same illusion towards his barbershop . ( Laughter )
He says , &quot; &quot; Dr. , this is not Fuffy , it looks perfectly like Fuffy , but it &apos;s another dog . &quot; &quot; All right ?
Now try to use the Freudian explanation .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re going to start talking about the latent beast of all human beings , or something like that , which is obviously quite absurd .
So what &apos;s actually happening ?
To explain this curious disorder , we go and look at the structure and function of normal visual pathways in the brain .
Normally visual signals go inside the oculars and get to the visual areas of the brain .
In fact , there are 30 areas in the back of the brain that only occupy vision , and when everything is elaborate , the message comes to a little structure called a fusiform circuit , where you perceive faces .
There are neurons that are sensitive to faces .
You can call it the facial area of the brain , OK ?
I talked about it before .
Now , when that area is damaged , you lose the ability to see the faces , right ?
But from that area , the message comes from within a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional center of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , defines the emotional meaning of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it a prey ? A predator ? A friend ?
Or is it something completely insignificant , like a piece of cigarette , or a chalk , or a — I don &apos;t mean that but — or a shoe , or something like that ? Okay ?
Something you can completely ignore .
So if the amygdala is excited , and that &apos;s important , the message can come to the autonomous nervous system .
The heart begins to beat stronger .
You start sweating to dissipate the heat you &apos;re about to create — because of the muscle effort .
And we &apos;re lucky , because we can put two electrodes on the palm of our hand and measure the variation in cutanic resistance produced by sweat .
So I can determine , as you look at something , if you &apos;re excited or not , okay ?
I &apos;ll get there in a minute .
So my idea was that when this guy looks at an object , any object , the message goes to visual areas and — by the way , it &apos;s processed around fusiform and recognizes it as a piselli plant or a table or her mother , right ?
And then the message goes to the amygdala and then to the autonomous nervous system .
But perhaps in this guy , the link that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system — the center of emotion in the brain — was interrupted by trauma .
So , since the fusiform tour is intact , the guy can still recognize his mother and he says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , it looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the connection to the emotions centers is cut , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , does not feel any heat ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , depending on the case ? Right ?
( Laughter ) So he says , &quot; &quot; How do I explain this mysterious lack of emotion ?
&quot; &quot; This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s a strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test it ?
That &apos;s how you do it , if you take one of you and put it in front of a screen , and you measure the galvanic resistance of your skin , and you show images on the screen , I can measure how much you sweat when you see an object , like a table or a shadow — of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pin-up , then you start sweating , right ?
And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
( Laughter ) Now , what happens — what happens if you show them to this patient ?
Take the patient and you show him images on the screen and you measure the galvanic resistance of his skin .
Tables and chairs and cigarettes , nothing happens , like normal people , but when you show him an image of his mother , the galvanic resistance of his skin is flat .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother because the connection between visual areas and the emotion centers are broken .
So his vision is normal because visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — laughs , plain and so on — but the connection between vision and emotion is interrupted and therefore he has the illusion that his mother is an imposer .
It &apos;s a wonderful example of the kind of things that we do , we take a bizarre , almost incomprehensible neurological psychiatric syndrome , and we say that the standard freudian vision is wrong , that we can actually provide a precise explanation in terms of neural anatomy known in the brain .
By the way , if this patient goes , and the mother calls him from an adjacent room — the phone calls — and he answers the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , Mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no illusion through the phone .
And then she approaches him after an hour and says , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
You really look like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
The reason is that there &apos;s a separate way from hearing centers in the brain to the emotions centers that have not been interrupted by trauma .
This explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , without problems .
When he sees it by person , he says it &apos;s an entrepreneur .
OK , so how is this complex circuit organized in the brain ?
Is it nature , genes , or is it culture ?
And we approach this problem by looking at another curious syndrome called ghost limb .
And you all know what a ghost limb is .
If an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for a cow , or is lost in war , for example , in the Iraq War — it &apos;s becoming a serious problem — you continue to feel vividly the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom leg or a ghost arm .
In fact , you can have a fantasy of any part of the body .
Believe it or not , even with faces .
I had patients with the utero removed — hysterectomy — who have a ghost utero , ghost cramps , including at the right time of the month .
And in fact , one student asked me the other day , do they also have phantom PMS ?
( Laughter ) A mature topic for scientific investigation , but we have not continued .
OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about fantasy arts through experiments ?
One of the things we discovered was that about half of the patients with ghost limbs say they can move the ghost .
He gives a poo on his shoulder to his brother , he answers the phone when he squeaks , he makes salt cades .
These are very compelling , vivid feelings .
The patient has no illusion .
He knows that his arm is not there , but nonetheless , it &apos;s a winning sensory experience for the patient .
But anyway , in about half of the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
The ghost limb — they say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the ghost limb is paralyzed .
He &apos;s stared at a serious spasm , and it &apos;s very painful .
If I could only move it , maybe pain would be alleviated . Now , why would a ghost limb be paralyzed ?
It looks like a symbol .
But when we look at the clinical records , what we find is that in these people with paralyzed fantasy limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the damage to peripheral nerves .
The arm nerve had been damaged , cut by , say , a motorcycle accident .
So the patient had a real arm , which was painful , in a blindfold for a few months , or a year , and then in the unhappy attempt to eliminate pain in the arm , the surgeon amplifies his arm and then you have a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
And this is a very serious clinical problem .
Patients depress .
Some of them are suicide driven , OK ?
So how is this syndrome ?
Now why do we have a paralyzed fantasy limb ?
When I looked at the medical record , I found that they had an arm whose nerves had been cut , and the arm had been paralyzed and haunting in a blinder for several months before the amputation and this pain then moved to the ghost itself .
Why is that happening ?
When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain was sending arm commands , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it got visual feedback that said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . No . Move . No . No . No .
And the mechanism is embedded in the circuits of the brain , and we call it &quot; &quot; caught paralysis , &quot; &quot; OK ?
The brain learns because of this association of Hebb , that the command itself to move its arm creates the feeling of the paralyzed arm .
And then , when the arm has been expanded , this paralysis is moved — to the image of the body and the ghost , OK ?
Now , how can you help these patients ?
How do you diseminate paralysis so that you can liberate them from this phantom of your phantom arm ?
Well , we said , what if you could send the command to the ghost , and give it the visual feedback that &apos;s obeying to the command , right ?
Maybe you could raise the pain of the ghost , the cramp of the ghost .
How do you do that ? VR .
But that cost millions of dollars .
So I found a way to do it with three dollars , but don &apos;t tell the companies that fund me .
( Laughter ) Okay ? I created what I call a mirror box .
Take a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and you put the ghost in there — and my first patient , Derek , came to me .
His arm was amputated 10 years ago .
He suffered a brachial avulsion , the nerves were cut , and his arm was paralyzed , haunting in a blindfold for a year , and then he was amputated .
He had a phantom , atrocally painful arm , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
It was a paralyzed ghost arm .
He came to me and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , the mirror box , right ?
And the patient puts his left ghost arm , which is stripped in a spasm , to the left of the mirror , and his normal arm on the right of the mirror in the same position , in the narrow position in a spasm , and looks in the mirror and what does he experience ?
He sees the ghost asset because he sees the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it &apos;s as though the ghost is asset .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Now look , move the ghost — your real fingers , or move your real fingers as you look in the mirror . &quot; &quot; It will have the visual experience that the ghost is moving , right ?
This is obvious , but the surprising thing is that the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ghost moves again and the pain , the juvenile spasm , is breathed . &quot; &quot; And remember , it was my first patient — ( Applause ) — Thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came and looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at the reflection of your fantasy , but he started laughing , but he did not speak .
He knows it &apos;s a reflection in the mirror , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and your ghost . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Or , I can &apos;t move the ghost . You know . It hurts . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ghost moves again , I can &apos;t believe it !
And my pain is raised . &quot; &quot; OK ?
And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closed his eyes .
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
&quot; Oh , nothing — it &apos;s paralyzed again . &quot;
&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , or my God , it moves again ! &quot;
It was just like a kid in a sweet store .
I said , OK , this confirms my theory of appraisal palsy and the important role of visual input , but I won &apos;t get a Nobel Prize for making anyone move their ghost limb .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless skill , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But then I started to realize that maybe other forms of paralysis that we see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonia — can have an understanding component that you can overcome with the simple use of a mirror .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — first of all , the guy can &apos;t walk around a mirror to alleviate pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and exert it for a week or two .
Maybe , after a period of practice , you can do less than the mirror , diseminate paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then get rid of the pain . &quot; &quot; He said OK and he took it home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s just two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So he took him home and he said , &quot; &quot; Doc , it won &apos;t believe us . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought the mirror box disappeared .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; No , no , no , does it know the ghost I &apos;ve had over the last 10 years ? &quot;
It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I — I worried , I said , my God , I mean , I changed the body image of this individual , what happens at the level of human subjects , ethics and all that ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does that bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , in the last three days I haven &apos;t had the ghost arm and therefore no pain in the ghost elbow , no pain in the ghost armor , all the pains have gone .
But the problem is that I still have the ghost fingers hanging off my shoulder , and my box doesn &apos;t get there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So it could change design and put it on my forehead so that I could eliminate my fantasy fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was a kind of magician .
Now , why is this happening ?
It &apos;s because the brain compares with tremendous sensory conflict .
He gets text messages from his sight , and they say the ghost has come back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no adequate perception , muscle signals say there &apos;s no arm , right ?
And the motor commands say the arm is there , and for this conflict the brain says , &quot; &quot; Ah , hell , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no ghost , there &apos;s no arm , right ?
It goes into a kind of denial — it denies the signals .
And when the arm disappears , the bonus is that the pain disappears , you can &apos;t have pain in the body that floats in space .
So this is bonus .
Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients from other groups in Helsinki , and it looks as good as treatment for ghost pain , and already , other people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
The stroke , you think of it as a fiber damage , nothing can be done about it .
But it turns out that a part of stroke paralysis is also paralysis that is understood , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
And it &apos;s also tested in clinical trials , helping many patients .
OK , let me change my way to the third part of my talk , in which I treat another strange phenomenon called synesthesia .
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the 19th century .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
He pointed out that some people in the population , who were completely normal , had the following peculiar — all the times they see a number , is colored .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is sweet , nine is induced , OK ?
Remember , these people are completely normal for other aspects .
Or C diesis . Sometimes the notes evoke a color .
C diesis is is blue , F diesis is is green , another tone could be yellow , right ?
Why is this happening ?
This is called synesthesia — Galton called it synesthesia , a mixture of senses .
In us , all the senses are distinct .
These people mix their senses .
Why is this happening ?
One of the two sides of this problem is very intriguing .
The synesthesia runs into families , so Galton said he had an inherited base , a genetic base .
Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this brings me to the main theme of this conference , which is creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , writers and creative people than normal people .
Why ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
Well , there are many theories .
One theory is they &apos;re insane .
It &apos;s not very scientific , so we can forget it .
Another theory is that they &apos;re drugs , right ?
Now , there might be a peanut of truth because it &apos;s much more common here in San Francisco Bay than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — let &apos;s ask what actually happens in synesthesia ? Okay ?
So we find that the area of colors and the area of numbers are actually attached to the brain , in fusiform .
And we concluded that there are accidental connections between color and numbers in the brain .
So every time you see a number , you see the corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you have synesthesia .
Now remember — why is this happening ?
Why should there be these connections in some people ?
Remember I said she runs in families ?
That gives you the clue .
There &apos;s an anormal gene , a mutated gene that causes these anormal connections .
All of us , apparently , are born with everything connected to everything else .
So every area of the brain is connected to all the other areas , and these are potatoes to create the modular architecture of the adult brain .
So if there &apos;s a gene that causes this potatorship , and if the gene mutates , then we have a scarce potatorship between areas of the nearby brain .
And if it &apos;s between numbers and colors , we &apos;ll have a numeriously color synesthesia .
If it &apos;s between sounds and colors , we &apos;ll have color synesthesia .
So far , all right .
Now , if this gene expresses itself throughout the brain and everything is interconnected ?
Well , think about what artists , writers and poets have in common , the ability to think metaphorically , by linking seemingly unrelated ideas , like , &quot; &quot; is Eastern , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; You say Juliet is the sun — does that mean that it &apos;s a bright-fired ball ?
Of course , schizophrenics do that , but this is another story , right ?
A normal one says it &apos;s as hot as the sun , as it travels like the sun , as it glows like the sun .
You instantly found the connections .
Now , if we assume that most connections and concepts express itself in other parts of the brain , then it will create a greater propensity to metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
From here , the incidence eight times more synesthesia between poets , artists and writers .
OK — it &apos;s a very frantic view of synesthesia .
The last demonstration — can I have a minute ?
( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetic , even if you deny it .
This is what I call the Martian alphabet , just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C .
Different forms for different phonemes , right ?
Here you have the Martian alphabet .
One of them is Kiki , one is bouba .
Which is Kiki and which is bouba ?
Who here thinks that this is Kiki and this is bouba ? Raise your hands .
Well , we have one or two mutants .
( Laughter ) Who here thinks this is bouba , this Kiki ? Raise your hands .
Ninety-nine percent of you .
Now , none of you are Martians , how did you do that ?
It &apos;s because all of you make a connection — synesthetic abstraction — meaning , say that acute inflection , Kiki , in the auditory cortex , the cells that are aroused , Kiki , mime the visual inflection — all of a sudden — of that toothed shape .
This is very important , because it tells you that your brain comes back primitive — it &apos;s just — it sounds like a stupid illusion , but photons in your eye draw this shape , and the cells in your ear aroused the auditory pathways , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and now we know that this happens in fusiform of the brain because when it &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to distinguish bouba Kiki but also lose the ability to understand metaphors .
If I ask this individual , &quot; &quot; Not everything that glows is gold , &quot; &quot; what does it mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and lucent , it &apos;s not said it &apos;s gold . &quot;
You have to measure specific weight , OK ? These lose completely the metaphorical meaning .
So this area is eight times larger in high school — especially in humans , than in the lower primates .
Something very interesting happens here in the angular tour , because it &apos;s the crossword between hearing and touch , and it &apos;s become huge in humans — and something very interesting happens .
And I think it &apos;s the basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
All these questions , that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists start exploring them through neuroimages , studying patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking your imagination seriously .
14 years ago , I first discovered this common material , fishing nets , used in the same way for centuries .
Today , I use them to create fluctuous , permanent , life-sized forms of buildings around the world .
I was an unlikely person to do these things .
I &apos;ve never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after high school , I ran into seven art school and I was dismissed by all seven .
I became an artist on my own , and I painted for 10 years , when they offered me a Fulbright scholarship for India .
By pressing me to make paintings , I sent my paintings and I came to Mahabalipuram .
The deadline for the exhibition came — my paintings didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
The fisherman village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried to hit the bronze .
But making big shapes was too heavy and expensive .
I went for a walk on the beach , looking at the fishermen shoveling their networks into the sand shops .
I would look at them every day , but that time I saw them differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric shapes without solid materials .
My first acceptable sculpture was done in collaboration with a fisherman .
It &apos;s a self-portrait called &quot; &quot; Bacin off . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) We painted it on feeds to photograph it .
I found their soft surfaces that reveal every single wind crop that constantly changes the appearance of surfaces .
I was mesmerized .
I continued to study artisanal traditions by collaborating with craftsmen , later in Lituania with the pipe manufacturers .
I liked the particular delicate people who gave my work , but I wanted to make them bigger — to move from being an object that you look at something that you lose .
And then I went back to India to work with those fishermen , and we made a network of a million and a half nodes made by hand — very briefly exposed to Madrid .
Thousands of people saw this , and one of them was the Manual Sola-Morales urbanist who was redesigning the mothership in Porto , in Portugal .
He asked me if I could build it as a permanent element for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I was able to do that by preserving my art .
Duraturo , engineered , permanent — these are opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
For two years , I looked for a fiber that could resist ultraviolet rays , saltwater , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
We needed something to keep the network in the middle of the round .
So we &apos;ve pulled up this ring for over 22 tons .
We had to build it to make it move harmoniously in the breeze and resist the hurricanes .
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and mobile .
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who &apos;s designing sails for America &apos;s Cup competition boats called Peter Heppel .
It helped me deal with the double challenge for a precise shape and a delicate movement .
I couldn &apos;t build it as I knew I could do , because hand-made nodes wouldn &apos;t resist Hurricane .
So I stripped a relationship with an industrial network manufacturer , and I learned what the variables of their machines are , and I discovered a way to make the network .
There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic craftsmanship into something that could be produced by machines .
We had to create it .
Three years and two children later , we teamed up a network of 4,600 square meters .
It was hard to believe that what I imagined was built , permanent without losing anything in its transposition .
( Applause ) This cross was blinding and anonymous .
So it made sense in that place .
I walked under it for the first time .
As I looked at the wind choreographers , I felt protected and , at the same time , connected with the infinite sky .
My life would never be the same .
I want to create these sculpture oases in spaces of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to take two directions that are new for my work .
Storetical mass of Philadelphia : it &apos;s a square , which I heard , needed a sculpture material that was lighter than the network .
So we experimented with small atomized water particles to create a dry fog that takes shape with the wind , and in doing the testing , we discovered that it can be formed by people who can interact and move in without getting wet .
I use this material to sculpt to track subway pathways above the ground in real time — like an X-ray of the circulation system of the city that you find .
Next challenge , the American Biennial of the American in Denver asked me if I could present the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnections in a sculpture .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to start , but I accepted .
I read about the latest earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that disfolded across the Pacific Ocean .
It has moved the tectonic plates of the Earth , accelerated the rotation of the planet and literally cracked the length of the day .
So I contacted NOAA , and I asked them to share the tsunami data , and I translated it into this .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; 1,26 &quot; &quot; which refers to the number of microseconds that a day has landed on Earth .
I couldn &apos;t build it with a steel ring , in the way I knew how to do it .
His shape was too complex .
So I replaced the metal armor with a reticulated soft of a fiber 15 times more resistant than steel .
The sculpture now could be entirely soft , which made it so light that it could bind to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
There were no software that could extract these complex forms and model them with gravity .
We had to create it .
And then I got a call from the city of New York that asked if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or Highline .
This new , soft structural method allows me to model and build these sculptures at the scale of a skyscraper .
They don &apos;t have the funding yet , but I dream now to bring them to cities around the world where there &apos;s more need .
14 years ago , I was looking for beauty in traditional things , in artisanal forms .
They now combine them with high-tech and engineering materials to create fancy , wobbly shapes of the size of buildings .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;m going to leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend of Phoenix .
A lawyer in the office who never got interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everybody into the building and took them out to lie under the sculpture .
They were all in jacket and tie , lying on the lawn , catching the changes in the wind from the wind in front of people who didn &apos;t know , sharing the covered in wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
To read this slide , you have to look for your age on the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we fall out of the graph .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
When I was a kid ...
This was my team .
I didn &apos;t like them , I didn &apos;t like looking at them .
So that &apos;s what I was doing . I was playing .
For all my teens , I fished on the shores of Connecticut , and these are the creatures I saw regularly .
But after I grew up and went to college , and I went home in the early &apos; 90s , this is what I found .
My team had shrunk .
It was like having your broken brigade .
And so when I was more or less investigated , from a personal perspective , as a fisherman , I started to wonder what the rest of the world thought of it .
I first looked at fish markets .
And when I went to the markets , I found myself , whether it was in North Carolina , or in Paris , London , everywhere , I kept seeing this strange group of four creatures repeating , over and over again , on menu , above the ice : shrimp , tuna , salmon and cod .
And I found it weird , and as I looked at it , I was wondering , did anybody notice this reduction of the fish available ?
Well , as I was investigating , I realized that people didn &apos;t see them as a team .
The normal people saw the fish like this .
It &apos;s not an unusual human feature to reduce the natural world to a few elements .
We &apos;ve done it 10,000 years ago , when we came out of caves .
If we look at the fire buffalo 10,000 years ago , we &apos;re going to see processes , wolves , we &apos;re going to see all kinds of different creatures .
But if we go on to 2,000 years ago , we &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
The same for birds .
If you look at the restaurant menus of New York City 150 , 200 years ago , we &apos;re going to see cats , beaks , cedron galli , tens of papers and dairy .
But let &apos;s jump ahead , in modern farming , and we &apos;ll see four species : chains , dairy , chickens and geese .
So it &apos;s normal to have gone in this direction .
But how did that happen ?
Well ...
It &apos;s a very new problem .
This is the way we fished in the oceans over the last 50 years .
The second World War has incentivized a war against fish .
The technology that we refined in World War II , sonar , lightweight polymers , all of these things were directed on fish .
So you see a huge increase in the amount of fishing , which has quadrupled over time , since the end of the Second World War today .
That means we &apos;re talking about 80 , 90 million tons of fish every year .
It &apos;s the equivalent of the human weight of China taken off the sea every year .
And it &apos;s not a coincidence that I use China as an example : China is now the largest fishing exploitation in the world .
That &apos;s only half the story .
The other half of the story is this incredible boom in film and aquaculture , which now , just in the last couple of years , started to overcome the amount of fishing .
So if we combine the amount of fish that &apos;s raised to the fish , we get the equivalent of twice the equivalent of China being made from the ocean every year .
And again , it &apos;s not a coincidence that I use China as an example , because , besides being the biggest fisherman , it &apos;s also the biggest farmer .
So let &apos;s look at the four choices we &apos;re making now .
The first one : the most consuming fish in America and most of the West , is the shrimp .
Fish shrimp , unraised , are a terrible product .
From 2.5 to 7.5 kilograms of unraised fish are killed regularly to carry half a kilogram of shrimp to the market .
And then you spend a lot of oil to put it on the market .
The Dalhouse University found , in a recent study , that dragoning the bottom to fish shrimp is one of the most polluting fishing methods .
So you can farm , and they &apos;re raised , a lot of them stretched into this area .
The problem is , ...
The places where shrimp are being raised are wild habitats , like mangrove forests .
Look at these beautiful roots .
These keep the soil compact , protect the shores , create habitats for the smallest fish , the shrimp , all important aspects for the environment .
Well , this is what happens in many mangrove forests .
We &apos;ve lost millions of hectares of mangrove over the last 30 to 40 years .
The destruction rate has decreased , but the lack of mangrove is still high .
The other thing that &apos;s happening is the phenomenon that Mark Benjamin , the filmmaker , called &quot; &quot; Nemo Places . &quot; &quot; This phenomenon is very important for everything you see in the coral reef .
This is what &apos;s happening , there are bars that float the bottom , causing bad cats , and the waste fish is slaughtered and turned into food for shrimp .
And sometimes , a lot of vessels , driven by slaves , weigh these fish , called &quot; &quot; junk fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would like to see in coral reefs and slaughter them , turning them into food for shrimp , a cannibal ecosystem to produce shrimp .
The other favorite fish in the United States , and all over the West , is tuna .
tuna is the global fish for excellence .
You have to look at these huge natural fishing reserves to understand tuna well .
Our fishery resource , called Regional Fisheries Management Organization , is called ICCAT : International Commission for the Atlantic Tones Protection .
The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it &quot; The International Compler for the Tonni Chapel . &quot;
We &apos;ve seen an improvement in ICAT over the last few years , and we can definitely improve , but we have to say tuna is a global fish , and to manage it , we have to be able to manage the world .
We could try to farm tuna , but tuna is a bad animal for aquaculture .
Many people don &apos;t know that tuna has warm blood .
Its temperature can go over 20 C &apos;s temperature , tuna can swim over 40 miles an hour .
So this factor elevates all the advantages of farming fish , right ?
Farmed fish are cold blood because they don &apos;t move very much .
It &apos;s perfect , because they have more proteins .
If you have this crazy , wild creature , swimming 40 miles an hour , and warm blood , you don &apos;t really have a good candidate for aquaculture .
The next creature , the most consumed fish in America and in the West , is salmon .
Salmon was also abused , but not necessarily fishing .
Here &apos;s my state , Connecticut .
Connecticut used to be rich in wild salmon .
But if you look at this map of Connecticut , each dot is a dam .
There are over 3,000 dams in Connecticut .
I often say that &apos;s why people there are so nervous — ( Laughter ) If someone could unlock the Connecticut Who , I think we could have a better world .
I made this comment in a conference that was responsible for national parks , and a man from North Carolina approached me , saying , &quot; &quot; You know , it shouldn &apos;t be that hard with his Connecticut , because we in North Carolina , have 35,000 dams . &quot; &quot; So this is a national epidemic , an international epidemic .
And there are dams everywhere , and this is exactly what keeps the salmon from depositing the eggs .
So we folded on aquaculture and , by judging numbers , salmon is one of the biggest successes .
When you started breeding salmon , it took up to three kilograms of unraised fish to produce half a kilogram of salmon .
You have to say the industry has improved .
The ratio went down to one , even though it &apos;s a little bit of a lie , because if you look at the way food is produced , it &apos;s measured in pellet , kilograms of pellets per pound of salmon .
These pillows are smaller fish .
So the real result , called FIFO , the fish worked and sold , is hard to point .
Whatever it is , the industry has reduced the relationship between salmon and finite product .
The problem is we &apos;re stuck with the amount of salmon we produce .
aquaculture is the food system that grows faster .
It &apos;s growing at a rate of seven percent a year .
And even if we raise less fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still killing a lot of small fish .
And it &apos;s not just the fish that we feed to other fish , we give fish to chicken meal and pigs .
So we have chickens that eat fish , but interestingly , we have fish that eat chickens .
Because the bottom product is vicious , feathers , blood , bone , is slaughtered and fed to fish .
I often wonder , is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish ?
It &apos;s kind of like the rehabilitation of the chicken and the egg . ( Laughter ) All together , though , it turns out to be a disaster .
We &apos;re talking about a figure between 20 to 30 million tons of wild creatures , which are taken from the ocean used and slaughtered .
It &apos;s the equivalent of a third of China or of all the people in the United States , which is taken out of the sea every year .
The last of the four guys is kind of a loving thing .
At first , the sandwich was preparing for halibut .
It all began because in a fast local food , when the manager discovered that Friday no one came .
It was a Catholic community , and they had to eat fish .
So he went to Ray Kroc and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to take you a sandwich with the fish , ready for halibut . &quot;
Ray Kroc said , &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work . &quot;
I &apos;d like to make a Hula Burger , with bread and a piece of ananas .
We do this , we bet .
The sandwich that &apos;s going to sell more will be the winner . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s very sad for the sea that didn &apos;t win the Hula Burger .
So he made his sandwich at halibut .
But unfortunately , the sandwich cost 30 cents .
Ray wanted it to cost 25 , so he opted for the Atlantic cod .
We know what happened to the Atlantic cod in New England .
So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is prepared with yellow cod in Alaska . It &apos;s the largest fish industry in the United States between one and 1.5 billion pounds of fish are taken from sea every year .
If we finish the yellow cod , the next option is probably the tilapia .
No one had ever heard of this fish 20 years ago .
It &apos;s an effective converter of vegetable protein in animal protein , and it &apos;s a gift of the sky for the third world .
It &apos;s actually a very sustainable solution , and it goes from an adult species to nine months .
The problem is that when you look in the West , tilapia doesn &apos;t do what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t have what you can think of as blue fish .
It doesn &apos;t have EPA and Omega-3 , which everybody thinks will make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , first of all , what do we do for poor sardine ?
This fish is a large part of those 20 or 30 million tons .
Well , one possibility that many environmentalists found was , &quot; &quot; Could we eat them ?
Could we eat them instead of giving them to salmon ?
There are discussions about this .
They &apos;re also rich in Omega-3 , a great source of EPA and DHA .
So they would be a chance .
And if we were to take that path , I would say , instead of paying a few dollars a kilogram , or a ton , and make it a fish feed , could we halve the fish and double the price for fishermen , and make that our way of treating that fish ?
Another possibility , though , which is much more interesting , is to look at the bibalves , particularly the heights .
Coozes are rich in EPA and DHA , like the tuna in the box .
They &apos;re low-energy consumption .
For one kilogram of marketplace , you use a third of the greenhouse gases required for the same amount of meat .
They don &apos;t require forage fish , they take their two-thirds by filtering water for microalgae .
That &apos;s where homega-3 comes from , not from fish .
These are the microalgae that make homega-3 , in the fish it &apos;s just bioconcentrated .
The heights and the boots filter a lot of water .
One coat can filter dozens of liters every day .
This is extremely important when we look at the world .
Today , nitrification , excessive use of phosphates in water courses causes algae to flourish .
Over 400 new dead zones have been created over the last 20 years , the cause of disappearing many marine creatures .
We may not even consider fish .
Consider the vegetables .
Consider the algae , all varieties that can contain very homega-3 , have a lot of proteins , all those things that really do well .
They triple water like heights .
And interestingly , you can feed cows .
I &apos;m not a big cow fan .
If you want to continue farming cows , today that water resources are limited , algae grow in the water , you don &apos;t have to cut them down , an important consideration .
And the last fish , it &apos;s a question point .
We have the ability to create aquaculture , and that creates an increase in marine protein for us .
This creature should be vegetarian , it should grow fast , it should adapt to climate change , and it should be a blue fish , the type of blue fish with EPA , DHA , omega-3 that we look for .
It &apos;s about paper .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for 15 years .
Every time I do a new service , someone says , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do it . We have a solution .
We can create a fish full of marine protein and homega-3 . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s great .
The idea , though , doesn &apos;t seem to develop .
It &apos;s time for me to do it .
If we do that , 30 million tons of fish , a third of the fish , it will stay in the sea .
So what I &apos;m saying is that this is the path we follow .
We follow our appetite more than our head .
But if we followed this path , we could have a lot more .
Thank you .

I became almost a little girl in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , you know , of course , the two hemispheres are completely separate from each other .
Excuse me . Thank you . It was a joy . Assistent : Even for me .
Information , in the form of energy , flows simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then explode in this huge collage that we &apos;re living , from its perfume and its taste , its texture and its sound .
I am an energy being connected to energy around me through the awareness of my right hemisphere .
And right now we &apos;re perfect , we &apos;re all beautiful and we &apos;re beautiful .
My left hemisphere — our left hemisphere — is a very different place .
Our left hemisphere thinks linear and methodically .
And our left hemisphere thinks through language .
And all I could detect was this energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with that ?
And I felt my lightest body . And imagine .
