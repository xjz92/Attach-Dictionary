By the end of this year , there will be about a billion people on this planet who are effectively using social media .
The only thing they have in common is that they will die .
And even though that may be a kind of terrible idea , I think it has profound implications worth exploring .
Now the first thing that got me thinking about this is a blog by Dick Dick Miller earlier this year , which was a journalist in science and technology that died in cancer .
And what Miller did was to make his family and friends write a blog that was published after he died in real time .
This is what I wrote at the beginning of that .
He said , &quot; &quot; There you are , and this is my last blog on my blog .
Pretty soon , I asked that once my eyes stopped suffering from cancer , my family and friends had to publish this letter that I wrote — as the first part of the transformation from an active site to archive . &quot; &quot; Now , as an archive journalist , Archive Miller might be better and healthier than others , and the fact of the matter is that today we &apos;re all making archives , which is completely different from anything that was created by a generation earlier .
Look at some statistics for a moment .
Right now there are 48 hours of video being lifted to YouTube every minute .
There are 200 million tweets spreading every day .
And the average Facebook user creates 90 pieces of content a month .
So when we think about our parents or grandparents , at best they might have produced some photos or home videos , or memoirs living in a box somewhere .
But today , very rich technical archives are being created to remain in cloud systems for an unnamed , years after we die .
And I think that will create an interesting opportunity for technologies .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technology , so what I want to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future will be .
And we &apos;re actually seeing some services that are designed to make us decide what &apos;s going to happen to our personal files on the Internet and our accounts in social media after we die .
One of them actually , quite appropriate , found me when I entered Delhi in a restaurant in New York at Fortune .
( Audio ) Adam Ostro : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AA : Yeah .
Death : death can surprise you anywhere , or time , even at the organic food restaurant .
AA : Who is that ?
Death : Go to the idie.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Ostro : It &apos;s kind of frightening , right ?
So what this service does , quite simply , is it allows you to create a message or a video that can be posted on Facebook after your death .
Another service now is called 1,000 memories .
And what this service allows is to create independence for those that you love on the Internet , full of pictures and video and stories that you can release after you die .
But what I think comes next is more interesting .
Now Deep Roy , may be familiar with many of you who , earlier in March , showed how he was able to analyze over 90,000 hours of household videos .
I think that the capability of machines to understand human languages and address enormous amounts of data continues to improve , will be possible to analyze a whole range of contents — tweets , videos and blogs — that we produce with massive numbers .
And I think by doing this , it will become possible for our digital personalities to continue to interact in the real world long after we die , thanks to the amount of content we create and the technological capabilities to understand all of them .
Now we &apos;ve already begun to see some experiments here .
A service called my next tweet analyzes all the Twitter flow , everything I published on Twitter , to predict what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the result may be kind of funny .
You can imagine what this might look like five or 20 years from now with the evolution of our technology possibilities .
Far forward , MIT &apos;s lab works on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if these robots were able to interact based on the qualities of a particular person based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that one makes in their lifetime ?
Finally , they returned this famous scene from the 2008 election night in the United States , when CNN channel transmitted that the Hollywood is alive for the wool.iA. in the Channel studio to meet Andrew Cooper .
What if we could use the same kind of technology to broadcast our loved ones in our living rooms — to interact in a semi-live way based on all the built content when they were alive .
I think that &apos;s going to be very , very possible and the amount of data that we use and the technological capabilities to understand are growing exponentially .
Now in closing , I think what we all need to think about if we want that to be our truth — and if that &apos;s true , what that means to the notion of life and everything comes next .
Thank you very much .

People come back to work after a job break : I call them the employees to work after a break .
These people who have come out of business to care for the elderly , to care for the children , to pursue a personal interest or a personal health problem .
All sorts of nearby career transmission : veterans and partners , military couples , retirement retirement from retirement or restorative labor to home .
Back to work after the career disconnect is hard because of the connection between employers and employers again .
Working people might see that employing people with a disconnect in their biography as a high-risk problem , and people who are unemployed can be skeptical about their ability to hire their professional lives , especially if they move away for a long time .
This disconnect is the problem I &apos;m trying to help solve .
Now , successful explorers are everywhere and in every field .
This is Sami Kevala .
It &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the U.K. who has been cut off for five years to be at home with his five children .
The Singapore newspapers recently wrote about nurses coming back to work after a long break .
And to talk about the long slides , this is Mimi Kahen .
It &apos;s a social worker in Urang province , who returned to work at the Social Service after 25 years .
And this is the longest disconnect I know about .
The judge at the Supreme Court Sandra de Oxanore has fallen out of work for five years early in her career .
And this is Tracy Schairo who &apos;s been off work for 13 years .
Tracy has been invited to write articles by the Day Shatch program from people who are trying to go back to work but have gone through a difficult period of time .
Tracy wrote that she was a mother of five children who loved having a spend at the time , but because of the divorce procedures that she had passed was necessary to go back to work , and she wanted to rework her life because she loved working .
She was doing what a lot of us do when we felt like we were a good day looking for a job .
She was looking for a job in investment or accounting , and she had spent the last nine months researching companies online and offering applications for a job without results .
I met Tracy in June 2011 , when the TV show asked me the &quot; &quot; Too Shat &quot; &quot; if I could work with her to see if I could help her change things .
The first thing I said to Terry was she had to get out of the house .
I told her that she had to go out to the public in her search of work and tell everyone who knew she wanted to go back to work .
I also told her , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll have a lot of talks that don &apos;t lead to something .
Stop that , and don &apos;t let it bind you .
There will be a few that eventually lead to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tracy a little bit later , but I want to share with you the discovery of his work when I was trying to go back to work after my career cut 11 years out of full-time workforce .
And this is that the view of people has frozen over time .
What I mean by that is that when you start to connect with people and come back in contact with these people from the past , the people you &apos;ve worked with or you &apos;ve been going to school , they &apos;ll remind you what you &apos;ve been in the past before you &apos;ve been in your career .
And that even if you feel yourself feared over time , as it happens with a lot of us as we move away from our professional identities .
So for example , you might think of yourself as a person like this .
This is me , encrypted after a whole day of driving my little cloud .
Or I &apos;m here in the kitchen .
But these people from the past , they have no idea about all this .
They just remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a huge amount of trust to come back to contact with these people and hear their enthusiasm about wanting to go back to work .
There &apos;s something else that I remember very clearly from my slip of work .
And that was that I was barely following the news of the business sector .
My experience is financial stuff . And I was barely following any news when I was at home taking care of my four little kids .
I was afraid to go to a lab and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
So I had to reengage with Wall Street Journell and read it for six months of the cover before I felt like I had a store about what was going on in the business world again .
I think consumers are the basis of workforce , and here &apos;s why .
We have a scarcity of functional transmission of the husband or the partners .
We are in a more stable time of life .
We have a big business experience .
We have a more startling view .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at the expense of the owner .
In addition , we have the excitement about going back to work because we &apos;ve been very far away from it for a while .
On the other hand , I talk to employers , and the business owners have two important things about employing the explorers .
First , employers worry that poor explorers are technically poor .
Now , I can tell you , I &apos;ve been lack of technological knowledge at a certain point , it &apos;s a temporary case .
I &apos;ve been doing financial analysis a long time ago using a Lotus 1-2-3 program .
I don &apos;t know if anybody can even remember it to that far , but I had to relearn it through the pixel .
It wasn &apos;t actually hard , because a lot of commands are the same .
I found PowerPoint more challenging , but I &apos;m now using PowerPoint all the time .
Investors told me that employers expect them to come to the table of discussions with the knowledge of a process in basic library management software .
And if they don &apos;t get to the speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
And they do .
The second thing that people have to do about the ingredients is that they &apos;re worried that the recipients don &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell the explorers that they need to do hard work to find out whether their interests and skills have changed or they haven &apos;t changed while they were in the career sector .
This is not a business owner .
It &apos;s the responsibility of the explorers to explain that to the owners of the work where they can add the most valuable thing .
Back in 2010 , I started noticing something .
I &apos;ve been tracking back to work since 2008 , and in 2010 I started noticing using the opportunity to work with short-term pay , whether it &apos;s called training or not , but training like experience , as a way for professionals to go back to work .
I saw the Goldman Sachs and Sarah Le and started integrating training programs designed to bring back to work .
I witnessed the return of an engineer as a candidate to bring him back to work in a different way to a training program at the level of entering the military , and then getting a permanent job after that .
I &apos;ve seen two universities combined training programs in executive learning programs for the middle stage of professional life .
So I wrote a report about what I was watching , which became the article for Harvard magazine called &quot; &quot; The 40-year-old intern . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editors there on this address , and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern with the rest of the college .
And then , from the front of the sentence by Fox Bezos News , they called the concept &quot; &quot; 50-year-olds . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Even five of the largest financial services companies have retraining programs for their careers in the financial sector .
At this point , hundreds of people shared .
These training periods are paid , and people who have moved on to permanent functions demand competitive salaries .
Now , seven of the largest engineering companies are driving training programs for returning engineers to work as part of a initiative with the American organization of engineers .
Now , why do companies include training programs ?
Because the training allows the owner to build the legislation decision on a sample that actually works instead of a business interview series , and the owner doesn &apos;t have to make employment decision all the time until the training ends .
The training period removes the imaginary risks that some managers agree when they recruit the recruiters to work , and they drag superior candidates who turn into excellent jobs .
Think about how far we are .
Before that , most employers were not interested in dealing with the explorers at all .
But now , it &apos;s not just the programs that are being developed specifically with the return to work in mind , but even you can &apos;t ask for these programs unless you have a disconnect in your professional biography .
This is a real change mark , for the right institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for consumers , we can also solve it for the transformative transformations .
In fact , a business owner just told me that veterans came back to a business program based on retraining .
And there &apos;s no reason why there &apos;s no pension training program .
Different gathering and the same concept .
So let me tell you what happened to Tracy Caprio .
Remember that she had to report all the people she knew about her desire to go back from work .
Well , one crucial conversation with a mother / father in her community led to a business show to Teressee , and the work was a accountable job in a financial cycle .
But it was a temporary job .
The company told her that there was a possibility that it could turn into more , but no inclusion .
That was in the fall of 2011 .
She loved the company , and she loved people , the office was less than 10 minutes away from her home .
So even though there was another business show for her in another company with a full-time job , she decided to take her chance with this training and surround what was better .
Well , it ended up going beyond all their expectations , and the company didn &apos;t just give a permanent presentation to her in the beginning of 2012 , but they made it more interesting and challenging , because they knew what to do .
Fast forward to 2015 , Tracy was left .
They paid instead of studying it at night for the MBA .
Tracy &apos;s temporary act was a test , just like training , and it ended up becoming a professor for all Tracy and the business owner .
Now , my goal is to reintroduce training to more and more employers .
But at the same time , if you &apos;re going to go back to work after a job break , you don &apos;t want to propose a training period or rearrangement of the training owner who doesn &apos;t have a formal retraining program .
Be the story of their first success , and you can be an example of more investors coming .
Thank you .

Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar technology industry .
And my little persistence seeks to impose ourselves in the environment by paying attention to ...
Faces to collective rehabilitation .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Ha . Stay with me for a moment .
It could take a while to be downloaded .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re just going to — we can just skip it — I &apos;m going to skip the video instead — ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .

It was afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I was working at ACLU as the organizational consultant of science .
I really loved my work , but I was one of those days when I was feeling a little frustrated .
So I went across the corridor to my colleague &apos;s office , Chris Hansen .
Chris worked in the organization for over 30 years , so he had ideas and profoundly institutional knowledge .
I explained to Chris that I felt a little bit stuck .
I &apos;ve been investigating a number of issues between science and civil liberty — very interesting .
But I wanted the organization to participate in these issues in a bigger way , in a way that could actually make a difference .
So Kerr entered the core of the subject and said , &quot; Well , among all the problems you &apos;ve been investigating , what are the five most important ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination and reproductive techniques and biobanks and ...
Oh , there &apos;s this wonderful thing : MRI imaging and using it to detect lying and ...
Oh , and of course there &apos;s the invention of genes . &quot; The invention of genes ? &quot;
Yes , you know , inventions on human genes .
&quot; &quot; No .
You tell me that the U.S. government is making patents on parts of the human body ?
This can &apos;t be true . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
And 20 minutes later , he actually came back to my office .
Oh , hey ! You &apos;re right ! Who should we go ?
( Laughter ) In fact , Chris is a really great lawyer , but he almost knows nothing about patent systems and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew a little bit about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even trying to imagine a patent lawyer .
So we had to learn a lot before we could lift lawsuits .
At first we needed to understand exactly what the patent was when someone invented a gene .
The invention of genes usually contains tens of layers , but the most controversial one of these is what &apos;s called DNA isolation , and it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s removed from the cell .
And the genetics inventor says , &quot; &quot; Look ? We didn &apos;t invent genes in your body . &quot; &quot; We invented isolated genes , and that &apos;s true , but the problem is that in the case of gene use , that would require to be isolated .
And the patent was not only given a single isolated gene , but every possible copy of that gene .
So what does that mean ?
It means you can &apos;t give your genes to your doctor and ask them or ask them to look at it , for example , to see if it has any mutations without taking the permission of the patent .
It also means that a patent right to prevent anybody from using this gene in research or in regular testing .
They allow patent holders , and they &apos;re usually private companies to cover the human genome domain , which hurts patients .
The father of that 10-year-old child with the CQT syndrome , which is a dangerous heart disease , if he doesn &apos;t treat , would cause a sudden death .
The company that got my innocence developed a invention in two genes associated with this disease as a test to diagnose this syndrome .
But then the company announced it , and they never gave it .
So another lab tried to give the test , but the company with the patent , and she wanted to spend the lab with the patent violation .
And as a result , the test has been unavailable for two years .
During that time Aimel died of not diagnosing him with the CQT syndrome .
Clearly , patents caused a problem , and they were damage to patients .
But is there a way we can challenge them ?
It turns out that the Supreme Court has shown in a long series of issues that some things are not allowed to give a patent in .
You can &apos;t patent a patent in nature &apos;s products like air , water , salt , the elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t register the laws of nature as a gravitational law : energy = mass , speed of light ^ 2 .
These are fundamental things that need to be used by everyone , and you don &apos;t have anybody in particular .
It seems to us that DNA is the essential component of life , which is organized to produce all of our proteins , one of the products of nature and the laws of nature , both regardless of whether it &apos;s inside our bodies or at the bottom of our test tube .
As we looked at this problem , we traveled all over the country to talk to different experts in different fields , scientists , physicists , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we were right politically and illegal , at least in theory .
They all thought that maybe we could win the genomes of patent roughly zero .
Why is that ?
Well , patent office has caused these patents for over 20 years .
There were thousands of patents in human genes , literally .
The patent trolls took a very hostile position of the status quo , the biotechnology industry developed under this practice , and it was introduced to a legislation to ban the gene patent a year later , and Congress did nothing at all .
Now , not Chris and I were the kind of person who pulled out of the challenge and heard us , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not enough to be right . &quot; &quot; It was caused to accept the challenge .
So , we started planning to build our case .
Now , patent issues continue to be like this : The company spends the company for little , inspiring problems , art .
We didn &apos;t get interested in this kind of problem , and we thought this issue was bigger than that .
It was taking scientific freedom , medical progress , patient rights .
So we decided to develop a case not as a case of your usual patent , but as a civil rights issue .
We plan to define a genomics holder that was highly invoked and then organize a wide variety of inventors and experts who could tell the court about all the ways that patents are hurting these patients and scientific innovation .
The main candidate was Myriad Genetics , a company in Solt City , in Utah .
Myriad carries my invention in Gene BRCA1 and Gene BRCA2 .
Women with mutations on these genes are significantly high risk of breast cancer and white cancer .
Myriad used her patent to keep a complete denial of using BCRA in the United States .
And that &apos;s what different labs had to stop the BCRA test .
It costs a lot of money to do a test that &apos;s over 3,000 dollars .
The company has stopped sharing their ordinary information with the global scientific community .
And perhaps the worst of all , for many years , was that Myriad refused to speak the test to include additional mutations that were discovered by a team of researchers in France .
It &apos;s estimated that over the course of a number of years , 12 percent of the women who have been tested get the wrong results of a negative test was supposed to be positive .
Here &apos;s Kathyn Max .
Ellen , the sister of Catherine , had breast cancer at the age of 40 , and it was tested by Myriad .
The result was negative .
The family comforted .
That means that Allen &apos;s cancer doesn &apos;t work in the family , and that other family members don &apos;t need to test .
But two years later , Kathyn was diagnosed with advanced leukemia cancer .
It turns out that Catherine &apos;s apartment was among the 12 percent who received negative outcomes .
If Ellen had been properly diagnosed , Catherine would have been tested , and her cancer would have stopped .
Since we settled on MyCraig , we had to then create a coalition of invited and experts who could get these problems out into light .
We ended up getting 20 highly committed prosecutors investing in genetics , geneticists who received detailed answers and stopping four important research institutions , together , like 150,000 scientists , physicists and members of women who couldn &apos;t afford the Myriad test or wanted to get a second opinion and couldn &apos;t get the patent .
One of the important challenges that we faced during preparation for the cause is to figure out how good it is to communicate with science .
So , in order to discuss that what Myriad did was not an inventor , and that the BCRA gene of nature products , we had to explain some basic concepts , what is genomics ? What is DNA ?
How is DNA isolated ? How is that not a invention ?
We spent hours and hours with inventors and experts trying to come up with ways to explain these concepts in a simple and accurate way .
And we ended up very dependent on metaphorical expressions like gold .
So , DNA isolation is like taking gold out of a mountain or getting it out of a river bottom .
You can have a patent on how to count gold , but not the patent of the gold itself .
It may take a lot of effort and hard work to get the gold out of the mountain , but you can still get a patent in gold . It &apos;s still gone .
And once you extract gold , you can use it in a lot of the things that you couldn &apos;t do when the gold was in the mountain , for example , you can use it in the jewelry industry , you can still have a patent in gold . It &apos;s still gold .
Now , we &apos;re in 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to publish our case .
We published it in the federal court , in the northern part of New York , and randomly , the judge Robert Speek was classified on the issue .
In March 2010 , the judge Switzerland released 152 pages and a full victory for our cause .
As we read his opinion , we couldn &apos;t overcome how science was described in the case .
I mean , we saw it was good , but not so much .
How did he develop this deep understanding of the issue at this short time ?
We couldn &apos;t understand how that happened .
So , it seems that the judge Switzerland employee wasn &apos;t just a lawyer ; it was a scientist .
It wasn &apos;t just a world that had Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What is this wonderful luck luck ?
Next , Myriad was finished in the U.S. Court of the federal Circle .
And that &apos;s where things got really interesting .
First , at a pivotal point of this issue , the U.S. government has replaced the roles .
So in the court of the region , the government gave a short speech to the Myriad .
But now , in a direct hesitation of her patent office , the government issued a speech that was meant to reconsider that case under the court of the region , and they realized that isolated DNA is not patent .
This was really big and totally unexpected .
The Federal Court listened to every patent issue , and he heard about it as a patent advocate .
So , despite this remarkable progress , we expected to lose .
And it happened .
Sort of .
It ended up splitting into the opinion , two to one .
But the judge that we &apos;ve seen has done this for completely different reasons .
The first judge claims Laurie depended on a completely false biological theory .
( Laughter ) He decided that Myriad made a new chemical material , which is absolutely incredible .
Myrides didn &apos;t argue , she came out of the dark .
The other judge , Murray said that she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
But she was thinking , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to remove the biotechnology industry . &quot; &quot; The third judge , Bruson agreed with us .
So now we &apos;ve done a petition at the Supreme Court .
And when you offer a commitment to the Supreme Court , you have to offer a question to the court to answer it .
Usually you take a long paragraph form like a whole page full of Indians , including &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; as well .
We &apos;ve introduced the shortest question ever given .
Four words : Would anyone take a genetic patent ?
Now , when Chris asked me about my opinion in these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
You might say , &quot; &quot; Does anyone have to take a genetic patent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want judges to take the same reaction when I asked that problem seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I really couldn &apos;t answer it .
The Supreme Court only enjoys one percent of the issues ahead , and agreed to listen to us .
The day of the vertical motion came , which was very exciting , a long line of people outside , standing in class two : 30 in the morning trying to enter the courthouse .
Two organizations for breast cancer in refrigerator are no longer the FORCE , they organized a protest on the tip of the court .
As Chris and I sat in the entrance a few moments before he entered to discuss the most important issue in his career .
It was clear how nervous I was .
But I waited when I walked into the courthouse and looked at this massage of smiling faces of our women who shared their own personal stories , geneticists who sacrifice much of their professional time to dedicate themselves to this issue and a variety of different actors , doctors , the Defense of Physicians , they gave a note to court in the case .
And also , in the room , three leaders from the Human Genome Project , one of whom contributed to discovering the DNA of James Watson , who gave a note to the court , pointed out to give me a patent on genomes called &quot; &quot; burning . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of representative groups in the room and contributions of all of them made this day actually after it was at stake .
The same motion was very impressive .
Chris elevated intelligence .
But to me , the most exciting aspect was to treat the judges with DNA isolated despite the chain of hot similarities and reverse replacements in the same way our legal team treats over the last seven years .
The judge is almost like the DNA gene that is isolated by extract a medical plant from the Amazon River .
As the judge Ruperz looked at a baseball boat in a tree .
And on one of my favorite moments , the judge Sotomayor declared that DNA is just the nature of sitting in front of us . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt a lot of confidence as we left the courthouse room that day , but I couldn &apos;t anticipate the result : nine to zero .
Part of the DNA that &apos;s naturally made is one of the products of nature , and being isolated simply doesn &apos;t make it easier to get a patent in it .
Moreover , Myriad did nothing in 24 hours of decision announced six labs that they would start offering the BRCA test .
And some of them promised to do the test at a lower price than what Myriad was doing .
Some promised to give a more inclusive test than the one that Myriad was presenting .
But of course , the decision is much bigger than Myriad .
It ended 25 years of giving patents to human genes in the United States .
And I became a major barrier in discoveries and chemical innovations .
And I helped to confirm that my patients as an improvisation , Kathyn and Ellen have the right to get the tests they need .
A few weeks after the court announced her decision , I got a letter in the mail .
From Bob Cook Dijan , a professor at Duke University , and one of the first visits that Chris and I visited when we started discussing this issue .
And I opened it up , and I found a little , frustrated animal .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk when we accepted that issue .
And so that led us to take that risk , we knew we were right .
It took about eight years from the beginning to end with a lot of fluctuations and volumes on the way .
Luckily , we helped , of course , but the groups that we built and the alliances that they created are the best ones .
Thank you .

The second quote is quoted by a president .
Sadly , the answer is yes .
And then you can put structures and test them .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
Everybody , literally , is more than the sum of its parts .
Where are the economic networks ?
What we looked at in detail was property networks .
We also personalize value for the company .
How did they organize ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies working in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
Let me show you through this representation .
Hello . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through a glimpse of about eight of my projects , collaborated with Danish Sorry Burroughs .
We call ourselves Burroughs and Row , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first project , which I call &quot; &quot; Uncle &apos;s phone . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been inspired by my weird uncle at the asking me to do things for him , as if I &apos;m an extension of his body — to run light or bring a glass of water for him , a cigarette box .
And I &apos;m bigger , it got worse and worse , and I started thinking about it as a kind of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because Uncle is a respected person in the Indian family .
And the situation that really fascinated me and struck me most is using it for the ground phone .
He grabs the speed and predicts me to ask him the number .
So as a refrigerator , I made it &quot; &quot; Uncle &apos;s phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it takes two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a single person &apos;s phone .
But the problem is , when I got out of the house and went to college , I started losing his instructions .
So I made a golden writer in which he could distribute his instructions to his sons and daughters around the world as an email .
So what he needed to do was take a paper and roll it in the pregnant , print his letter or something and pull out the paper .
This device will automatically send the message as an email to the meaning person .
So here you can see , we integrated a lot of electronics that understand all these mechanical movements and convert them into digital .
So my uncle is just dealing with the mechanical interface .
And of course , the thing had to be big and it had to provide a kind of ritual , the way my uncle admired me .
The next job is to install a sense of sound that we call the &quot; &quot; belly . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work on the principle of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy creatures and sensation and kindness .
So the way it works is that we have these paintings , which we put on the wall , behind them , we have these little creatures hiding .
And once it &apos;s silent , it sort of crawls out .
And if they &apos;re more silent , they &apos;re external .
With the lowest sound , they hide again .
So we had these panels in three walls of the room .
And we had over 500 of these canals hidden behind them .
So here &apos;s how it works .
This is a prototype .
So when it &apos;s quiet , it kind of comes out of the boards .
And you hear as humans do , or do real organisms .
They &apos;re immune to the sounds they fear for a while .
They don &apos;t interact with the sound of the background .
You &apos;ll hear a train in a moment that they don &apos;t interact with .
( Cheers ) But they interact with the sounds of the front . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Whistling ) So we worked really hard to make it as vibrant as possible .
So each pack has its own behavior , psychological , mood , personality and so on .
So this is an early prototype .
Of course , a lot better then .
And we made it interacting with people , but we found that people were playing and playing with them .
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The missing person . &quot; &quot; And we were very fascinated by playing at the creator of the imagination .
How could it be possible to experience the sense of anesthesia ?
So we worked with a company that specializes in monitoring the camera , and we asked them to develop software , using a camera that could look at people in the room and track them and compensate one person in the background , make it invisible .
So I &apos;m going to show you an early prototype .
On the right-hand side you can see my colleague Sorry , who is already in space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processor video where the camera made it invisible .
Sorry entered the room . Bob ! It turned into something that was invisible .
And you can see that the camera is tracking it and directing it .
It &apos;s a very prime video . So we didn &apos;t have to deal with overlap and all that , but it got very soon , later .
And the way we used it is that it was in a room where we had a camera looking at space , and we had a screen on every wall .
And as people walk in the room , they &apos;ll see themselves on the screen , except for one difference : one person was always hidden wherever they moved in the room .
This is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sunday Sunday . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a paper , like a snapshot of a childhood sketch of an oil spill or a sun .
And from the front , this thing appears very powerful and very robust , and on the other hand , it appears to be very weak .
So people walk in the room and they may ignore it almost , thinking it &apos;s just a waterfall on the ground .
But once they walk next to him , he starts climbing the wall in a forged way .
And he would feel tired , and he would collapse every time .
( Laughter ) So this works . It &apos;s a cartoon of a man headed upside down .
His head is so heavy , so full of heavy ideas , that he kind of falls in his hat , and his body has grown up like a plant .
What he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s moving upside down his head with an unpredictable motion and very slow motion .
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there , and the surface was very inadequate , it would start to navigate in space .
And there are no wires .
So I &apos;ll show you an example — so when people go into the room , the thing is activated .
And very slow , over a few minutes , it goes up in a kind of painful way , and then it gains a warm force and it looks almost like it &apos;s about to fall .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to indulge the viewer to go and help , or save it .
But it doesn &apos;t really need that , because , again , it can sort of lift itself .
And this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked on breathing , like most of our work , over the years to make mechanics true and achieve mobility .
And it was so important for us to take the moment that it would fall , because if we somehow made it so that it would fall , it would hurt itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t give me that capability , or the sense of wanting to help him .
So I &apos;m going to show you a quick video where we do a experimental scenario — it &apos;s a lot quicker .
This is my colleague . He launched it .
Now he feels nervous , so he &apos;s going to catch him .
But it doesn &apos;t need that , because it tells itself to rise .
So this is a work that we &apos;ve been fascinated by , working with the aesthetic puppies embedded with thousands of different sizes of optical fibers , which fills like the night sky .
It &apos;s the size of the night sky .
And so we wrapped this into a bubble , which is like a bear blood , which was suspended on the surface .
And the idea was to sort of show something very cold and away and abstract like the universe in a regular form like a bear blood , which is comfortable and intimate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the shape of the bear &apos;s blood and you would recognize it almost as a hole in space , and as if you were looking at a mysterious night sky .
And this is the last job , and it &apos;s in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Square . &quot; &quot; Well , imagine a little cube that &apos;s as small as you stand in front of you in the middle of the room , and once you get close , try to get you to a cube is to double its lifespan and four times its size .
So this thing extends and continues to create dynamics with people who move around — like he &apos;s trying to sort of hide a secret inside his tent or something .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really like technology , because it causes us a lot of hunger in our work over the years .
But we use them because we &apos;re interested in the way that they can help us express the patterns of emotions and behaviors in these creatures that we create .
And once our minds come to mind as a creature , as if it &apos;s almost an innovation process is figuring out how this creature really wants to exist and shape it wants to take and the way it wants to move .
Thank you .

Well , I want to talk today about how we talk about love .
And in particular , I want to talk about the mistake by talking about love .
Perhaps most of us will fall in love many times over our lifetime , and in English , this metaphor , the falling , is actually the key way we talk about that experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I imagine this expression , what I envision comes from a animation — like there &apos;s a man walking on the sidewalk , without paying attention , expressing an open hole , and what &apos;s to say is that he fell in the neighborhood channel down .
And I envision that this way because falling is not jumping .
Silence is unintended , uncontrollable .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our consent .
And this is — it &apos;s the fundamental way we talk about starting a new relationship .
I &apos;m a writer and an English teacher , which means I think of words to make my living .
You can say that I &apos;m struggling to say that the language that we use is important , and I would say that many of the metaphors that we use to talk about love — perhaps even most of them — is a problem .
So , with love , we fall .
We hit .
We are crushed .
We lose consciousness .
We burn passion .
Love makes us crazy , makes us sick .
Our hearts pain , and they break it later .
So our metaphorical expressions are the experience of pulling someone with severe or illness .
( Laughter ) It is .
It puts us in the position of victims of unexpected circumstances and never imposed .
In a book that only passes out , there are 16 translations of geography , which is the word that the Bible uses to sign an angry god .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re here using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain the thousands of people . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So , how did that happen ?
How did we get to connect love with great pain and suffering ?
And why do we talk about this beautiful experience as if we &apos;re victims ?
It &apos;s a tough question , but I have some theories .
Which is , I want to focus on a particular metaphor , which is the idea of love as insane .
When I first started looking for romantic love , I found these crazy expressions everywhere .
The history of Western culture is held in words that link love to mental illness .
These are just a few examples .
And William Shakespeare said , &quot; Love is just insane , &quot; &quot; as you walk . &quot; &quot; Frederick Nietsche said , &quot; There &apos;s always some insane in love . &quot;
&quot; It made me look , it made me look very crazy with love — &quot; ( Laughter ) for the great philosopher , Beoncé Nullins . ( Laughter )
I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a very troubling relationship from the beginning .
And the distance was very distant for the first two years , so this to me meant very beautiful moments and very sad moments .
I can remember one moment in particular .
I was sitting on bed in a subway in South America , and I was watching the person I love coming out of the door .
And it was late around the middle of the night , we had a lot of time on the dining table , and when we went back to our room , he threw his purposes in a bag and out .
I was 22 , and it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
I had another week until the plane date came back , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I had to get in to travel across to the outside , but I had no idea how to get there .
I didn &apos;t have a very homeless and very little money , and I didn &apos;t speak Spanish .
Somebody more adventure than me might be an opportunity , but I was really paralyzed .
I &apos;d sat there .
And then it exploded from crying .
But even though I was horrified , some voices in my head were saying , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
I must have done love very well . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some of me wanted a desperate sense of love .
And this sounds very strange to me right now , but at the age of 22 , I was yearning to live an exciting experience , and at that moment , I was irrational and angry and destructive , and very peculiar , I thought somehow that my sense of the boy who had just left me was devastating .
It shouldn &apos;t really be surprising , given that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , and Albumin and Wurley called &quot; &quot; crazy love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he went back to our room .
Our health .
We spent another week kind of happy traveling together .
After that , when I got to the pilot , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrifying and so great .
It must be a real love story . &quot; &quot; I was expecting to feel my first love as crazy , and of course , it was exactly the prediction .
But someone like this — as if my whole happiness is standing on his girlfriend — it wasn &apos;t appropriate for me or for him .
But I think this experience of love is not strange .
Most of us feel a little crazy in the early stages of romantic love .
In fact , there &apos;s a study that confirms that this is somewhat natural , because , from the perspective of neurochemistry , romantic love and mental illness , they &apos;re not easily separated .
That &apos;s right .
I used this study since 1999 , blood analysis to emphasize that the serotonin levels of people who have a new love relationship are very close to the levels of serotonin for people who have been diagnosed with diabetes disorder .
There &apos;s even some evidence that love is associated with changing our mood states and our behavior .
There are other studies that prove that most relationships start this way .
Researchers see that the decline of serotonin levels is associated with strategic thinking about the topic of love , which is like feeling that someone has created a camp in your brain .
And most of us feel this way when we fall in love for the first time .
But the good news is that it goes on a long time — from a few months to two years usually .
When I came back from my journey to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , checking my email , based on a response to a boy I loved .
I decided that if my friends don &apos;t understand my very professional friends , then you don &apos;t need their friends .
So I stopped expanding with most of them .
And maybe that was the most common year of my life .
But I think I felt it was my job to be miserable , because if I could be miserable , I would prove how much I loved it .
And if I could prove that , then we would eventually be together .
This is the real insane , because there is no universal rule that says that suffering deserves great pay , but we talk about love as if it &apos;s true .
Our experiences in love are biological and cultural .
Biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in the brain , it tells us that love is painful when , after trees or separation , the chemical reward is drawn .
And actually — and you &apos;ve heard this — from a neurochemical perspective , a very similar separation by pulling cocaine , which I find reassuring .
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses a language to form and foster these ideas about love .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about pain expressions and addiction and insanity .
It &apos;s kind of an interesting reaction .
Love is strong and painful , and we express this in our words and our stories , but then our words and stories lead us to expect love to be strong and painful .
What &apos;s interesting to me is that this is all happening in culture that measures the only continuous marriage of life .
It looks like we want both directions : we want love to feel crazy , and we want it to continue all the time .
It sounds terrible .
( Laughter ) To repair that , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
So imagine if we were all less negative in love .
If we &apos;re more sad , more open , more miserable , and instead of falling in love , we go back to love .
I know it takes a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest that .
In their book , &quot; &quot; The metaphor we live in , &quot; &quot; the linguist Mark Johnson and George Lockoff showed a very important solution to this dilemma , which is to change our metaphor .
They say that expressions actually shape the way we face the world , and they can even work as evidence for future business , as self-fulfilling constructions .
Johnson Wolkov suggested a new metaphor for love : love as a shared artwork .
I really love this way of thinking about love .
Language speaks about metaphor as having genes , which is fundamentally a way of looking at all the implications of the consequences , or ideas that are present in a particular metaphor .
And Johnson Wolkov talked about everything that requires this collective artwork : effort , convention , patience , common goals .
These ideas are good for our cultural investment in the long-term romantic commitment , and they work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , dissent , open , non-verbal , sexuality — because this expression brings far more complex ideas to experience someone &apos;s love .
So if love is a shared artwork , then love is an aesthetic experience .
Love is unpredictable , love is created , requires love to communicate and discipline , it &apos;s frustrated and emotionally required .
Love involves both happiness and pain .
After all , every love experience is different .
When I was younger , I had never been allowed to ask for more love , so I couldn &apos;t even accept any love in advance .
When Juliet met 14 years old for the first time — or , when Juliet of 14 couldn &apos;t be with Romo , who I met four days ago , she didn &apos;t feel disappointed or worrying .
Where is it ?
She wants to die .
Really ?
And as a new one , at this stage in the play , the third chapter of five , Romo didn &apos;t die .
It was alive , it was healthy , it was just thrown out of the city .
I realize that Verona in the 16th century was unlike modern North America , but when I first read this play , when I was 14 years old , Juliet suffering made sense to me .
Reframing love as something that I can create with someone I like , and not as something that happens to me without my will or my consent , is a encouraging thing .
It &apos;s still hard .
Love still looks completely crazy and broken some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my work in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to do together .
That &apos;s not easy , too .
But it &apos;s much better than the alternative , which is the kind of crazy thing .
This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s death .
Instead , it requires you to trust your life and talk about things when trust is hard , which seems very simple , but it &apos;s actually a kind of radical revolutionary .
And that &apos;s because you stop thinking about yourself and what you gain or lose in your relationship , and you start thinking about what you have to offer .
This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not good collaborators . Maybe that &apos;s not for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than I had planned , but it &apos;s still beautiful . &quot; &quot; The nice thing about collaborative artwork is that it won &apos;t melt or paint or bend itself .
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really happy to be here .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here ; otherwise it would be a little weird .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Here . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
It &apos;s here .
I mean Earth .
And by saying , &quot; &quot; All of us . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean this theater ; it &apos;s life , all life forms on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to single-celled , from mold to weirdness , to flying bears . ( Laughter )
What &apos;s interesting is that the Earth is the only place we know that it has life — 8.7 million species .
We &apos;ve looked elsewhere , maybe we haven &apos;t looked for corals or enough , but we &apos;ve looked and we haven &apos;t found . The Earth is the only place we know that it has life .
Is Earth special ?
This is a question I &apos;ve always wanted to know the answer since I was a little kid , and I think 80 percent of this stage has thought about itself and also wanted to know the answer .
To understand if there are other planets — there are in our solar system or outside — they can contain life , the first step is to understand what life requires .
It turns out that , in all these 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
On the one hand , all life forms on Earth need energy .
The complex life like us extend our energy from the sun , but life below Earth can get energy from sources like chemical reactions .
There are a number of different sources of energy available on all planets .
On the other hand , all life forms need food or food .
And this sounds a difficult task , especially if you want a luminescent tomato .
( Laughter ) But all life forms on Earth are derived from just six components , and these elements can be found in any plant body in our solar system .
So this puts it in the middle as a long column , the hardest thing to reach .
It &apos;s not a uniform ; it &apos;s water .
( Laughter ) Even though the preacher would have been great . ( Laughter )
And not frozen water , not water in a gas case ; it &apos;s liquid water .
This is what life needs to continue , all forms of life .
And many of the solar system bodies don &apos;t have liquid water ; so we don &apos;t look there .
There are other objects in the solar system that may have liquid water , perhaps more than Earth , but are harvested under frozen skin ; so it &apos;s hard to reach , and it &apos;s hard to get , and it &apos;s hard to even detect if there &apos;s life there .
So it leaves us with small bodies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s simplify the problem ourselves .
Let &apos;s just think of liquid water on the surface of a planet .
There are only three objects in our solar system that we can think of in terms of having liquid water on the surface of a planet , and they are — in order to the distance of the sun : flower , Earth , Mars .
You want to have a climate that allows water to remain liquid .
You have to be careful about this climate .
You don &apos;t have to have very dense climate or toxins or heat ; then you end up being very hot like a flower , and you can &apos;t get liquid water .
But if you have very thin climate or cold , it would end up like Mars ; very cold .
So Venus is very hot , Mars is very cold , and the Earth is totally recycled .
You can look at these pictures behind me and you &apos;ll see automatically where , in our solar system , life can continue .
It &apos;s a problem that looks like Goldilocks , which is so simple that a child can understand it .
But , I &apos;d like to remind you of two things that we often don &apos;t think of as Goldilocs story , but I think they &apos;ve made a connection here .
The first thing is , if the mother beatbox was so cold when Goldilocs walked into the room , does that mean that it &apos;s always too cold ?
Or maybe it was a precedent ?
So until Goldilocks entered the room determines the answer we &apos;re going to get in the story .
It &apos;s also about planets .
They &apos;re not static things , they &apos;re changing .
They vary and evolved .
And also air wraps .
So let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
It &apos;s not the highest accuracy , it &apos;s not the most glamorous picture , but it &apos;s a picture that shows the glamour radiating its way on the surface of the planet , maintaining its flow water ; it needs hundreds or thousands or tens of years to form .
This can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
Mars &apos;s climate is so cold and cold enough to stabilize liquid water .
This picture tells you that Mars climate has changed , and it has changed dramatically .
And it changed from the condition that it would have been designed as a planet for life , because the three main requirements of life have been around for a long time .
Where did this atmosphere allow water to remain liquid on the surface ?
Well , there &apos;s an idea that he escaped into space .
The atmospheric particles have enough energy to escape from the attraction of the planet , escaping into space without reference .
And this happens to all the atmospheric objects .
Comets have amazing visual representations of climate parties .
But Venus also has an atmosphere that &apos;s gone all the time , and so on Mars and Earth .
It &apos;s just a matter of degree and scale of this parties .
So we want to figure out how long it &apos;s gone ; we can explain this shift .
How does the climate get energy for parties ?
How do atoms get enough energy to parties ?
There are two ways , if we want to simplify things a little bit .
The first is sunlight .
The light from the Sun can be absorbed by climate atoms and heat atoms .
Yes , I dance ; they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even in my wedding . ( Laughter )
They get enough energy to escape and parties from the gravity of the planet just by gaining heat .
The other way to get energy is solar wind .
They &apos;re atoms , mass , material that goes off the surface of the sun and goes silently through the solar system at 400 kilometers per second , sometimes faster during the solar storms , pouring through space to planets and their atmosphere and maybe exposing atmospheric atoms with the energy needed for parties as well .
This is something that interests me because it &apos;s associated with the prayer of life .
I mentioned there are two things about the story of Goldilocks that I wanted to bring your attention and remind you about ; the second thing is a little bit more complicated .
If the father &apos;s bear pot was so hot , and the mother beatbox was so cold , shouldn &apos;t the child beaten have to be more cooler if we were going to walk through context ?
This is something you &apos;ve accepted all of your life , when you think about it a little bit more , maybe it doesn &apos;t look that simple .
And of course , the distance between the planet and the sun determines its temperature .
And this has an impact on its health of life .
But maybe there are other things we should think about .
Maybe it &apos;s the same vessels that also help identify the mystery of the story , what &apos;s the right equation .
I can talk to you about a lot of different characteristics of these three planets can affect their health of life , but for selfish reasons associated with my research and the fact that I &apos;m standing here holding the cow and not you — ( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to talk to you for a minute or two about magnetic fields .
The Earth has one ; Venus and Mars have no .
The magnetic fields are generating in the deep abdomen of the planet by connecting electrodes to a massive fluid material that creates the old and large magnetic field that falls the Earth .
If you have a compass , you know which direction is the north .
Venus and Mars don &apos;t have that .
If you have a joint on Venus or Mars , you &apos;re familiar with it ; you &apos;re the results .
( Laughter ) Is this affecting the health of life ?
Well , what &apos;s the probability of that ?
Many scientists see that the magnetic field of the planet acts as a armor of its atmospheres , reflects the solar atoms away from the planet by having a force that has a field printer associated with electrical charges of these atoms .
But I &apos;d rather see him as a container glass of the authorities ; just for planets .
( Laughter ) And yes , my colleagues who are going to see this later will realize that this is the first time in our society &apos;s history where the solar wind is being resembled with the ocean . ( Laughter )
Well , the result then is that the Earth may have been protected for billions of years because we have a magnetic field .
The atmosphere was not able to get off .
Mars , on the other hand , was unprotected because it loses the magnetic field , and for billions of years it may have been stripped out of its atmosphere enough to cause it to be transformed from a planet that is good for life to the planet that we see today .
Other scientists think that the magnetic field may work in a way that &apos;s more like a tree on a compound , where the planet can interact with more solar power than the planet would interact with itself .
These dose can collect energy from the solar wind .
A magnetic field can collect solar power that allows more atmospheric parties to occur .
It &apos;s an idea that we have to test , but the impact and how it works seems obvious .
That &apos;s because we know that solar power is being installed in our atmosphere ; here on Earth .
This energy is driven by the magnetic field chains down where the polar regions , where the beautiful polar horizon is causing a beautiful polar horizon .
If you &apos;ve tested it , you know it &apos;s wonderful .
We know that energy gets in .
And we try to measure how many atoms come out , and whether the magnetic field affects it in any way .
So I &apos;ve given you a problem here , but I don &apos;t have a solution for it yet .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it .
Well , we &apos;ve sent a spacecraft to three planets .
Some of them are still in orbit , including the MAVEN spacecraft that &apos;s orbiting Mars right now , which I &apos;ve been involved in that is being driven from here ; outside of Colorado University .
It &apos;s designed to measure the extent of the atmosphere .
We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
When we get all the measurements , we can combine all of them , and we can understand how the three planets interact with the space environment , with what surrounds them .
And we can decide whether the magnetic field is important for the prayer of life , or not .
When did we get the answer , why should we care ?
I mean , I &apos;m very interested ...
It &apos;s also true , but really .
( Laughter ) First of all , the answer to this question will teach us a lot about these three planets : flower , Earth and Mars , not just about how they interact with their surroundings today , but also how they &apos;ve been billions of years ago ; whether they &apos;re right to live old or not .
It &apos;s going to teach us about the atmosphere that surrounds us and close to us .
More than that , what we &apos;re going to learn from these planets can be applied to the atmospheres anywhere , including the planets that we &apos;re now observing around the stars .
For example , the induced spacecraft that was built and controlled from here in Boulder , noticed over the last two years an area in the sky the size of a cool printer , and found thousands of planets — in one area of the sky the size of a cold printer we don &apos;t think they differ from any other part of the sky .
We &apos;ve progressed in 20 years , from not knowing one planet outside of our solar system , to knowing so much of it now , that we don &apos;t know which one we &apos;re going to read first .
Any lever will help .
In fact , according to the observations that Keimeer took and some other observations like that , we now believe that among 200 billion stars in the Milky Way alone , every star there , at least one planet .
In addition , estimates suggest that somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion of these planets can be considered to be alive in our galaxy .
We have these observations from those planets , but we don &apos;t yet know which ones are good for life .
It &apos;s a little bit like being stuck with a red spot — ( Laughter ) on stage , and you know that there are other worlds out there , and you really want to know more about them , you want to respond and learn whether one or two of them might look a little bit like you .
You can &apos;t do that ; you can &apos;t go there , not yet .
So you have to use the tools that you &apos;ve developed around you for flower , land and Mars , and you have to apply them to these other situations , and you hope that you come up with reasonable conclusions of data , and that you &apos;re going to be able to identify the best candidates to be life-friendly planets , who are not .
Eventually , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
This is the only planet that we know is good for life , although pretty soon we will know more .
But now , this is the only planet that is alive , this is our red spot .
I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
That &apos;s true .
Think about everything I brought to us .
Think of all the services that we use all the communications — all kinds of entertainment , all kinds of business and trade .
And that happens during our lifetime .
I &apos;m very sure one day we &apos;ll write history hundreds of years from now , our generation will be remembered by the generation that has become connected online , the generation that has built something that &apos;s truly global .
But at the same time , the Internet has problems , very serious problems with information security and problems with the privacy of users .
And I spent years in my career addressing these problems .
So let me show you something .
This is Brin .
This flexible disk is a disk of five inches infected with Parin &apos;s virus .
It &apos;s the first virus we found for personal computers .
And in fact , we know where Barin came from .
We know because it says that inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
Okay .
This is the slice of the infected pill , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that here he says , &quot; &quot; Hello to the cell . &quot; &quot; And then he goes on and he says , 1986 , simple and glory .
Simple and glory are the first names of Pakistani .
There &apos;s actually a phone number and address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
And now 2011 .
That was 25 years ago .
The personal computer viruses have 25 years now .
So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
So let &apos;s see , these are some pictures I took when I was in Pakistan .
This is from Lahore , which is about 300 kilometers south of Abuadabad , where Ben Laden was caught .
This is what the street looks like .
And this is the street that leads to this building , a house of 730 in a system in the Alabama town .
And I knocked the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess who &apos;s opening the door ?
Simple and glory , still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the situation . It &apos;s simple .
And sitting is his brother Abed .
These are people who wrote the first computer virus .
Now of course , we &apos;ve had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them what they felt about what they started .
And I got some satisfaction from figuring out that both simple and gloriously their computers had more viruses than once , and other viruses were completely different over the years .
So there &apos;s a kind of justice in the world above everything .
Now viruses that we used to see in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s are not a problem anymore .
So let me show you some examples of what they looked like .
What I &apos;m working on here is a system that I can run old programs on a modern computer .
So let me just ride some scaffolding , go there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s turn on a Four and 40 virus first .
And you can see on the top of the screen , there are four or four crawling across your computer when you get this .
You know you &apos;ve got it because it actually shows up .
This is another one called Craash virus invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one that actually plays some voices .
( Scream whistle ) And the last example is a laser example of what a marshmallow virus does .
Yes , somebody walks through your screen once you get caught .
So it was easy to know that you had a virus when viruses were programmed by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , it &apos;s not programmed by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What we have here in the background is an example of the systems that we &apos;re working on in our lab where we &apos;re tracking viruses worldwide .
So we see in real time that we &apos;ve stopped a virus in Sweden , Taiwan , Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if we connect again to our lab systems through the network , we can only see in real time just an idea of how many viruses are , how many malware examples we find every day .
This is the last virus we &apos;ve discovered in a profile called serverver.exe .
And we found it here three seconds ago that he accepted , six seconds ago .
And if we go through the page , it &apos;s just phenomenal .
We find tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands .
And this is the last 20 minutes of malware every day .
So where does all this come from ?
Well today , it &apos;s organized criminal gangs that are programming these viruses because they get money from their viral .
It &apos;s like a guerrilla to go to gosk.com .
This site works in Moscow , where they buy infected computers .
So if you &apos;re a virus programmer and you &apos;re able to get Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing with it , you can sell these computers with other people &apos;s computers .
And they &apos;re actually going to pay you money for these computers .
So how do these people turn money into money ?
Well , there are many different ways , like picking up bank steams , which steal money from your bank account on the web , when you do bank work on the web , or keys records .
The keyboard records sit in the computer silently , hidden from the wait , and they record anything they print .
So you &apos;re sitting in your computer looking at Google .
Every research you do at Google keeps and sends to criminals .
Every email you write keeps and sends to criminals .
Same with every secret word and so on .
But what they &apos;re looking for is time periods when you &apos;re on the web and you &apos;re buying on the grid in any electronic store .
Because when you buy in the store , you write your name and your number of credit cards and your secret traffic number .
And this is an example of a file that we found in a service a few weeks ago .
That &apos;s a credit card number , that &apos;s the end of the prayer , and that &apos;s the secret number , and that &apos;s the name of the card owner .
Once you get credit card information , other people can go into the network and buy what you want with this information .
And that &apos;s obviously a problem .
Now we have a whole black market and an economic system built for cybercrime .
So an example of how these people can do their work , we went and took a look at the Internet pages and looked for people who were needed .
We found people like Beijing Snowden originally from Sweden and his partner in crime as well in the pages of people who were required in the Interval , Mr. Cheshukushima Jane , an American citizen .
These young people were running a process called IMU , an electronic crime process where they were winning millions .
Now both of them are Harban .
No one knows where they are .
The U.S. officials just a few weeks ago , Gammeo calculated in Swiss Bank , going back to Mr. Jane , and that calculation was 14.9 million U.S. dollars .
So the amount of money that cybercrime generates is enormous .
That means that cybercriminals can invest in their attacks .
We know that cybercriminals hire programmers , hire people to test their code , they have modern systems with ASK-G databases .
And they can afford to see how we work like how security men work and try to find their way about which security we can build .
They also use the universal nature of the Internet for their benefit .
I mean , the Internet is global .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s called the Internet .
And if we go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the virtual world , here &apos;s a video made by Craig Nux , where it shows how a single malware family can move around the world .
This process believes that it originally started from Estonia moving from country to country , as soon as someone tries to close the site .
So you can &apos;t stop these people .
They &apos;re going to turn from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another , moving around the world using the fact that we don &apos;t have the ability to do global policy processes like this .
So the Internet is like giving someone free aircraft ticket to all the cybercriminals in the world .
The criminals who couldn &apos;t get us before could get us there .
So how do you really go to find criminals on the network ?
How do you really track them ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is a single infected file .
Here I &apos;m looking at the X-rail of a picture file that has a security threat .
And that basically means if you want to see this picture in your Windows computer , it actually dominates your computer and operates the code .
Now if you look at the picture file , this is , well , there &apos;s a snapshot , and here &apos;s where the attack code begins .
And this code has been recognized , so let &apos;s uncoding .
It was uploaded with XOR 97 .
You just have to believe me that it is , it is .
And we can go here and really start deciphering the code .
Well the yellow part of the code is now unicked .
And I know it doesn &apos;t look very different from the origin .
But just keep staring at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here , you can see the web address here , unionseseek.com / ioo.exe , and when you show this picture in your computer , it &apos;s actually going to download and run that program .
And that &apos;s the back door that &apos;s going to control your computer .
But more interestingly , if we continue to decode , we will find this mysterious sentence that says O600,78RUs .
That code there is below the code as a kind of signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I was looking at that and trying to figure out what it means .
So , of course , I did the Google search .
I didn &apos;t find any results . It wasn &apos;t there .
So I talked to young people in the lab .
And we have two Russian people in our lab , and one mentioned , well , it ends up with Rice like Russia .
And 78 is the symbol of the city of St. Petersburgh .
Perhaps for example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car boards and things like this .
So I went to look for contact directions in St. Petersburgh , and in a long way , we finally found a particular website .
Here &apos;s this Russian guy who was working on the web a few years ago who ran his own website and ran a blog under the Live Journell magazine .
And in this blog , he &apos;s talking about his life in St. Petersburg , at the beginning of his 20s about his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a very beautiful car .
In fact , this guy is driving Mercedes Benz 600 LEDs with a six-kilometer engine and the power of 400 horses .
Now this is a beautiful car for a young man in the 20s in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about his car ?
It &apos;s not about her .
He actually had a crash with him .
In the middle of the city in St. Petersburgh , he actually hit his car with another car .
And he put pictures in the blog about his car accident , this is his gun , and here &apos;s the one that hit him .
And you can actually see the left panel end up with 78RUS .
And if you take a look at the image of the scene , you can see the picture of the chair is O6,000,78RUS .
Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if you &apos;re here , where I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m losing my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when electronic criminals are caught ?
Well in most cases it doesn &apos;t get there yet .
The vast majority of cybercrime issues , we don &apos;t know from any continent of attack .
And even if we can find criminals , there &apos;s probably no product .
Local police don &apos;t act , and if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t catch them .
I hope it &apos;s easier , unfortunately it &apos;s not .
But things also change very quickly .
You &apos;ve all heard of things like Stuxnet .
So if you look at what Stuxnet did , it was the injury of this court .
That programmed court from Simens controls a reasonable programmer .
And that &apos;s what our infrastructure is managing .
That &apos;s what runs everything around us .
The programmer controls are these little boxes that don &apos;t have a screen or a keyboard that code and put it in place and do it .
For example , the elevator in this building is probably controlled by one of these .
And when St. Tony infects one of these , this is a great revolution in the kind of risk we should worry about .
Because everything around us is switched on like this .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Go to any plant , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food plant , look around you , everything is switched on with computers .
Everything is switched on with computers .
Everything depends on these computers to work .
We &apos;ve become very dependent on the Internet on basic things like electricity on computers to work .
And that &apos;s really something that creates new problems for us .
We need to find a way to continue our work even if computers fail .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So the metaphor means that we can do things even though the things that we take from something that &apos;s not here .
It &apos;s actually very basic things to think about sustainability , thinking about backup , thinking about things that really matter .
Now I tell you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet , I love it .
Think of all the services that we have on the web .
Think if you take us if one day you don &apos;t really have a reason or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I worry that maybe we can &apos;t see that .
I worry that we &apos;re running into trouble because of cybercrime .
Cyber crime is something that can take these things from us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the network , and I feel that if we don &apos;t fight cybercrime , we risk it all .
We have to do it globally , and we have to do it now .
What we need is more global security forces to find cybercrime gangs , these organized gangs that profit millions of their attacks .
That &apos;s more important than running antiretrovirals or protection walls .
What really matters is that finding people behind these attacks and more importantly , we have to find people who are about to become part of this cybercrime world , but they haven &apos;t yet done it .
We have to find people with skills , but without opportunities , and give them opportunities to use their skills for good .
Thank you very much .

The world is changing very rapidly .
If you look at this graph , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , the predictions of Goldman Sachs say that the Chinese economy is going to be about the same size as the U.S. economy .
And if you look at the graph of 2050 , you &apos;ll see that it shows that the Chinese economy will become twice the size of the U.S. economy and the Indian economy as well as the U.S. economy .
But we have to consider that these projections were before the economic crisis in Western markets .
And two weeks ago , I was looking at the new projections that came out by the BMI Bank , which illustrates when China &apos;s economy is going to go beyond the U.S. economy .
Goldman Sachs forecast was in 2027 .
The post-crisis projections are 2020 .
That &apos;s after one decade .
China is going to change the world in two basic concepts .
The first is that it &apos;s a mega-growing country with 1.3 billion people that have been growing for 30 years at a rate of 10 percent every year .
In one decade , the largest economy will become the world &apos;s largest economy .
So it &apos;s never happened in the modern age , if the country with the largest economy in the world in developing countries instead of being developed countries .
The second thing is that for the first time in modern history , the dominant state of the world , which I think China is a country that is in the east , not in the West , and it &apos;s a very different cultural roots .
And I know that it &apos;s common in the West , I think that once countries develop , they earn the character of Western countries .
But that &apos;s an illusion .
Suppose that modernism is only shaped by competition , markets and technology is a false assumption .
They also form by history and culture .
China is not a Western country , and it &apos;s not going to be a Western country .
And it will remain with very different respect .
The big question is , how do we understand China ?
How are we going to absorb what China is ?
And the problem that &apos;s so common today is that we &apos;re trying to understand things from a Western perspective and using Western ideas .
That &apos;s wrong !
Now I want to show you three stones , basically , to try to understand China as a beginning .
First of all , China is not a nation-state .
I &apos;ve called herself over the last hundred years , but anyone knows China knows it &apos;s much more advanced than that history .
This is China , after the Cuban strains in 221 BC , after the era of wars , it &apos;s the birth of modern China .
And you can see that the border is very different to China &apos;s borders .
And then came the Halloween strain era , and also since 2000 years .
And as you can see , I &apos;ve occupied most of what &apos;s known as the Eastern China , where most Chinese live today , and there are more than Chinese .
Now what &apos;s remarkable about this is that what gives China the concept of China is that what Chinese means is that China &apos;s concept will not come from looking at the last hundred years , nor is it a nation-state nation , as it happens in the West , but from the period in which the state of China has been the state of expression .
Now , old wardens conclude me the distinct state concepts , the concepts of family , social relationships , like Johannes , the concepts of governance , Confucius .
And things like that came out of the era of civilization .
To make it even more clear , China is not like Western countries , not like most countries in the world , it &apos;s shaped by the notion of civilization , but it &apos;s found in terms of civilization rather than the nation-state concept .
Another thing we can add to this is that we really know that China is a large geographic and demographic country with 1.3 billion people .
And what we don &apos;t usually realize is the fact that China is so diverse and so multiverse , and it &apos;s not central at all .
Beijing &apos;s power can &apos;t be simpler , even if we think that &apos;s what happens .
It never happens .
Well , this is China , the state of civilization rather than the nation-state .
And what does this mean ?
This has a huge impact .
I &apos;m going to give you two of these effects .
The first is that the most important political concept of China is the unit of survival of Chinese culture .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe had been divided by the Roman Empire .
I &apos;ve come , and I &apos;ve been divided since then .
And China at this time had the exact opposite of trying to hold and maintain this great civilization in parallel with the concept of the state .
The second thing is probably very innovative , and it &apos;s about Hong Kong .
Do you remember Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese Constitution was .
One country , two systems .
And I bet everyone in the Western world has honested an idea .
There &apos;s an independent system .
When Hong Kong graduates under China &apos;s power , it &apos;s not going to be so critical after 13 years of political and international system in Hong Kong very different than it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . We got it wrong .
Because we thought it would work in our view of the state .
We thought it would happen in Germany in 1990 .
Remember what happened .
When the West swallowed right away .
One nation , one system .
This is the state mindset .
But this mindset can &apos;t be drawn to China , it &apos;s a nation of civilization , that the principle of one civilization , one system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
China &apos;s response to the Hong Kong issue is the same as Taiwan , which is the natural response of one civilization , many systems .
Let me give you another fundamental stone to try to understand China , perhaps a slightly strange base .
Chinese have a very different perspective on race compared to other countries .
Do you know that among 1.3 billion people in China , 90 percent of them belong to the same race as the Halloween race ?
And this is very different from most of the world &apos;s largest population .
Like India , the United States of Indonesia , Brazil , all of these countries are made of ethnic mixture .
China is not .
China is multi-ethnic in the other side .
And the question is , why ?
The reason is , I think , fundamentally , is to go back to the state of civilization .
Maybe going back to 2,000 years to the era of celebration and war and mercy and understanding that all of this has led over time , that the nation of Han has naturally expanded because of its strength , because of its sense of connection and its cultural character .
Back in history and into experiments , we can see that the greatest benefit came from the idea that without the bloodline , China would still be as coherent as it was .
The personality of the Halloween was the link that connected this country together .
But the thing about this is that the hallucinations have a very weak concept of cultural diversity .
They really believe in their science , and they don &apos;t respect other people who don &apos;t care about their authority .
And for example , we can see their collaboration with the Eiger and with the Tibet .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the third foundation of the Chinese state .
The relationship between the Chinese government and the Chinese community is very different than the one in the West .
We &apos;re here in the West busy thinking , at least in this age , that power and legislation that govern the state is a kind of democracy .
And the problem with this approach is that the Chinese government has more legislation and power between Chinese than it is in Western countries .
And the reason for that is that , in fact , there are two reasons .
They &apos;re not democracy at all , because if we want to apply our terms , China is not going to decrease democracy at all .
And the reason for this is that the country in China has a very special representation of whether it &apos;s Parliament or government or country for all forms of Chinese culture .
And that brings the situation in China to a kind of religious role .
And the second reason , whether in Europe or in North America , power has always been in a position of challenge , meaning in the European tradition , history speaks a lot about the struggle between the church and the Astroturic class and the trafficking for 1,000 years , that Chinese power has not faced any challenge .
No important revolution .
So we can see the way power is formed in China , and it &apos;s very different from the way our power is shaped in Western history .
And the result is that China is a very different concept of government .
When we treat it as a horse or a stranger , or as an entity that needs to undermine its power or value it , Chinese don &apos;t see it that way .
Chinese look at power as a partner , not just as a partner , but as a family member , not just as a family member , but as a family member , but as a family member .
This is the Chinese view of the Chinese government , and it &apos;s very different from our view .
And they &apos;re so touched by the government in a very different way than it is in the West .
And I want to show you my vision of what we &apos;re facing today in the Chinese context is a new model , which is different from all we &apos;re seeing and all we &apos;re thinking .
We need to know that China believes in the market , in the country .
I mean , Adam Smith wrote in the late 18th century that the Chinese market was more sophisticated and more organized than any market in Europe , far from the time of Mao , which was the story in which , while , or different .
But on the verge of a very strong country , there are many ways .
The government of China is everywhere .
I mean , it &apos;s leading companies that most companies are civil companies .
Special companies , whatever big they are , like Linufu , depend on a number of ways of government aid .
The economic goals are determined by government .
And government extends its power into multiple domains , we know each other like one-child policy .
More than that , a very old tradition of government construction .
I mean , if we look at the image of the construction , we see that the Great Wall of China is its meaning .
But there &apos;s another teacher that &apos;s the great channel that started to be founded in the fifth century before Christmas .
And it ended exactly in the 17th century .
It stretches about 114 miles up to Beijing and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary infrastructure projects in China , which I think explains what we see today , like what we &apos;ve seen from opening the three Great Cars , and many of the facilities that the state is funding within China .
So these are the three basic stones to try to understand China , to disappear it as the nation of one nation of one race , and of course this nation is different from us and its relationship with the different community .
And yet , largely , we think that we can understand China by comparing it to a Western model and looking at it in Western eyes and in Western terms .
And if you want to know why we continue to understand China wrong , and our expectations are always wrong there , in fact , that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I think , as I should say , the impression of China is the European mindset .
It &apos;s the hubris .
It &apos;s the feeling of excellence , and we think we are the best and we are the global scale .
Second , it &apos;s ignorance .
We refuse to confront the idea of difference between the East and the West .
You know , there &apos;s an interesting paragraph in Paul Cohen &apos;s book , the American historian .
Paul Cohen says that the West thinks of himself as the most universal culture that can be applied widely among most cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many areas , it &apos;s the most limited in thought , because over the last 200 years , the West has been a dominant world , a dominant one that has not had to understand the civilizations and civilizations of others .
Because she thought that Western culture could force her way .
Even if we were to mean at the other end , all the other civilizations in the world that have been around for a long time in the face of the western culture that forced the West culture to understand , because the West was present in those societies .
And for that , as a result , the Eastern cultures are more global than the West .
I mean , take , for example .
Eastern Asia : Japan , Korea , China , a third of the world lives there .
It &apos;s the most powerful economic area in the world today .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that people from East Asia know a lot about the West than the West knows about East Asia .
And this is a very important point for the present .
Because of what &apos;s happening today , you remember the graph , the Golden Sachs projection diagram .
You see what happens very quickly , compared to history , the world is being driven , not by developed countries , but by developing countries .
And we see this in the meetings of the big 20 countries , which are rapidly occupying the position of the seventh largest , or the eight-year-old countries .
And there are two implications for this .
The first is that the West is losing very rapidly .
And there was an obvious representation of this last year , especially in Copenhagen at the Climate Change Conference .
Europe didn &apos;t exist at the end of the conversation .
How did this happen before ?
Maybe more than 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
The second consequence is that the world will become , as a consequence of what &apos;s going on today , will become a strange world for us , because it &apos;s being shaped by cultures and traditions and history that we don &apos;t know anything about or ignorant about .
And finally , I &apos;m afraid that Europe is a little different , but the Europeans are largely immersed and unaware of the changes that are happening in the world today .
Some people say , somebody &apos;s a British friend of mine in China says that the old continent is going to be mysterious about forgetting , maybe that &apos;s right , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
But there &apos;s also a problem going forward with this problem that Europe is moving away from the wishes of the world and a sense of loss of the sense of the future .
I mean , Europe was at some point controlling the future .
Like what was happening in the 19th century .
But that &apos;s not true anymore .
And if you want to feel the future , you have to taste the future in China , in the Old Copernicus .
This is a train station ; it &apos;s something that has never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t look like a normal train station .
It &apos;s a new Gowanus train station for high-speed trains .
China now has the largest railroad network of any country in the world , and it will soon have more than all the railroad in the world together .
Now look at this idea : it &apos;s an idea that you &apos;re going to try soon in the suburbs of Beijing .
It &apos;s the giant bus that &apos;s expanding to 2,000 people on board .
You &apos;re moving on a knife through rural roads and cars moving inside .
It &apos;s going 100 miles an hour .
And that &apos;s how things are going to go , because China has a very different problem from Europe , and from the United States , China has a huge number of people and a few areas .
And this is the solution to this problem where it will apply to China in many , many cities that are over 20 million people .
So how do I end this talk ?
How do we face it should be about the world that we see changing very rapidly and causing it ?
I think there will be positive and negative reasons for that .
But I want to say that even though there is a positive image of something .
For 200 years , the world has been basically governed before a handful of people .
They live in Europe and North America .
And these countries , like China and India , which have 38 percent of the world &apos;s population and countries like Indonesia and Brazil , that would mean the real democratic representation of the 200 years .
The civilizations and cultures that we were ignoring , that were silent , that nobody knew about , would be embedded in new sites as representatives of the world .
As humans , they &apos;re completely welcome , and we have to learn about these civilizations .
This giant ship is the one that Zing sail in the early 1500s in its big travels across the Southern Sea , East and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
And the little boat in front of it was made 80 years later , which Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Now look very well at this cartoon made by Zozo in 138 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Oh my God , Chinese also invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
Now before you pay attention , or start singing , or choosing a better color , I want to identify what I mean by a revolution .
In the words of revolution , I mean radical and long-term change in the way we think and our behaviors — in the way we think and how we behave .
Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because things don &apos;t work ; they don &apos;t work very well .
And that makes me very sad , because I &apos;m tired and tired of things that don &apos;t work .
You know , I &apos;ve been tired and tired of us and we don &apos;t live our possibilities .
I was tired and tired of us and we were late .
And we &apos;re at the last center of several things — for example , social factors .
We &apos;re at the recent center of Europe in innovation .
Here we are at the end , right down at the bottom , at the last dense density of innovation .
We &apos;re in the final center of medical care , and that &apos;s important for the sense of well-being .
And here we are , not only in the last center of the European Union , but the last in Europe , right down .
And worst of all , it was released three weeks ago , and most of you saw it , Economist .
We &apos;re measuring a place on Earth , according to the statistics of GDP per capita — a place on Earth .
This is socially , let &apos;s look at education .
Where was our classification three weeks ago in another report came from the OECD ?
The final center in reading , mathematics and science , the last center .
Business : The lowest percentage in the European Union .
Business men provide benefits to society .
Why is it ? What &apos;s going on ?
Less than a percentage of entrepreneurs who start projects .
And that &apos;s irrespective of the fact that all people realize that small businesses are the engine of the economy .
We run most people , we create most taxes .
So if our engine broke , guess what ?
The final center of GDP per capita is at the level of Europe .
The last one .
So it &apos;s not surprising , my friends , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , we have the worst business .
And these are facts , guys .
It &apos;s not a story , it &apos;s not a myth .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a plot from me on Bulgaria . These are facts .
And so I think it should be clear , it &apos;s very clear that our system is broken .
The way we think , the way we behave , the system of our behavior is broken .
We need a radical change in the way we think and our behaviors to transform Bulgaria for better , for us , for our friends , for our families and our future .
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;ll start positive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re in the last center because we — and it might be hard for some of you — because we &apos;re setting ourselves up .
We &apos;re setting ourselves up because we can &apos;t play .
I said play , right .
If you forget what play is , this is what play looks like .
Small play , kids play , adults play .
We can &apos;t play .
In fact , we underestimate the value of play .
And we underestimate its value in three aspects .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three aspects .
Social : 45 years of what ?
It &apos;s communism of appreciating society and state above the individual and the right , of unintentional , of creativity , of self-expression of individual and innovation .
In contrast , what do we value ?
Because obviously how to implement and generate and use knowledge is influenced by social and institutional context that told us that communism is what ?
Being solemn .
To be very solemn .
I did .
( Applause ) Be solemn .
I can &apos;t remember how many times I was hired in the park because I let my kids play in the courtyard .
God forbid to play in clay , or dirty water , which will kill them .
I was told that we should not let our children play a lot , because life is new and we should train them on the quality of life .
We have a belief in seriousness that goes between us .
It &apos;s a social norm that goes between us .
It &apos;s a new knowledge .
It &apos;s 45 years of this that created what I call my father , father &apos;s worker . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Which works like this .
Step one : the woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to take a baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : We tear the baby . Wow !
And then what happens in the third step ?
I want to go back to my work , because I want to meet my job or I just want to go to coffee .
I &apos;m going to go and introduce Becko to the father .
But we have to remember that this father has this serious thought for 45 years .
So what happens ?
This virus transferred to the child , and it takes a very long time — like the Red forest trees — this serious belief to come out of our operating system .
What happens next ?
It &apos;s about education where we have a deep education system that has changed a subtle change over the last hundred years that value education , preservation and standard standards , and underestimate the amount of self-expression , self-discovery , wonder , creativity and play .
It &apos;s a sterile system .
Truth story : I went looking for a school for my kids .
We went to that elite school and said they would study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read five times a day and all these things .
And we said to them , &quot; &quot; Well , what about play and vacation ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Huh . There won &apos;t be one moment in the table . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime .
And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious that education is so serious that we create autonomous robot workers to put a trajectory in holes that have been stolen before .
Please apologize , but today &apos;s problems are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
We need to adapt , and the ability to learn to become creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t want mechanical work .
But no , if we think about solemn , it even goes into the work that can &apos;t play .
We create robotic work and treat them as property , for chips and then we get rid of them .
What are the characteristics of Bulgarian labor ?
I replace — do what I &apos;m saying because I &apos;m the president .
I &apos;m the president and I see you .
It &apos;s not trust — obviously you &apos;re a criminal , so I &apos;m going to put the cameras .
( Laughter ) Clearly , you &apos;re stupid , so I &apos;m going to put some small procedures to follow so that you don &apos;t get off the road .
And they &apos;re constrained — don &apos;t use your lover , don &apos;t use your personal computer , don &apos;t go online , don &apos;t use instant messaging .
This is kind of bad and unprofessional .
And at the end of the day , you &apos;re not satisfied , because you &apos;re constrained and you &apos;re not appreciated and you don &apos;t get any pleasure .
In social development , in education and business , it can &apos;t play .
And so we &apos;re late , because we don &apos;t give value to play .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; This is silly speech , Steve . What a stupid idea .
It can &apos;t be because of entertainment .
It &apos;s just playing , it &apos;s ridiculous . We have the power of this social thought .
Well , I &apos;ll say no .
And I &apos;ll prove that to you in the next part of this show — that play is the incentive , is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria into the best .
Narrator : Our brains are ready to play .
Evolution has chosen , over millions of years , many play patterns of animals and humans .
You know something ?
Evolution did a good job , very good , to abolish the unappropriate qualities of us and identify the right qualities of the competitive advantage .
Nature is not stupid , and she chose entertainment .
Through the animal kingdom , for example , ants , ants play .
You may not know this .
But when he plays , he learns the social system , and the movement of things .
The rats play , but what you might not know is that rats that play a lot more brains and learn better tasks , skills .
Cats play , and we all know that cats play .
But what you might not know is that the cats that deprive play , can &apos;t socially communicate .
They can always hunt , but they can &apos;t deal with the social context .
The bears play .
But what you might not know is that bears that play more live longer .
It &apos;s not the bears that learn to catch fish better .
But those that play more .
And this is another interesting study , which proved , that there &apos;s a big correlation between play and brain size .
The more you play , the bigger the brain is .
Dolphins , with big brains , play a lot .
But who do you think of large brains who play more ?
Indeed you , the human .
Children play , we all play , no matter what our gender is , our race , our colors , our data .
Play is a unified global thing , we all play .
Not only kids who play , adults also play .
There &apos;s a nice term : Newtonian , which is to keep the properties of play and the younger in adults .
Who is the biggest Newtonian ?
Humans . We practice and play sports .
We do it for entertainment , or for Olympics , or as professionals .
We play on instruments .
We dance , we accept , we sing , we act like crazy .
We &apos;ve been trained to play since birth to an advanced age .
We were constantly forced to do this — we had to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
That &apos;s a big benefit .
And there &apos;s also a benefit for animals , there &apos;s also a benefit for humans .
For example , I &apos;ve shown that play triggers the growth of neurons in the tapestry lobby , in the region that controls emotions .
It also proved that it stimulates the evolution of the cortex before the frontal cortex where cognitive capability is concentrated .
And as a result of this ? What happens ?
We &apos;re developing our emotional struggle more if we play more .
We develop better decision-making capabilities if we play more .
That &apos;s a reality .
It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s a fairy tale , it &apos;s a static science and it &apos;s self-determined .
These are the benefits of play .
It &apos;s our genetic right , and we &apos;re walking or seeing or hearing .
If we admire ourselves from play , we admire ourselves as if we did with any other genetic right .
We advocate ourselves for progress .
This is a simple exercise for a few seconds : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without fun .
Imagine a world with no theater , no art , no song , no dance , no football , no laughing .
What would this world look like ?
Very resistant .
Very , very primitive .
Now imagine where your work is .
Is it fun ? Small ?
Or maybe your friend &apos;s workplace — we &apos;re now thinking further .
Is it fun ? Small ?
Or is it a place where boredom , replacement , control , constraint , not disease , not trustworthy ?
We have that concept that the opposite of entertainment is work .
We even feel guilty if we &apos;re playing at work .
&quot; Ah , my colleagues and I laughed , they must have thought I don &apos;t have much work . &quot; &quot; Or , &quot; Oh , I have to hide so that my boss doesn &apos;t see me . &quot;
He would think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have some news for you : we thought this was my return .
We refuse to play not work . We refuse to play .
It &apos;s depression , it &apos;s depression .
In fact , play helps improve our work .
Just as there are benefits to humans and animals , there are benefits to play at work .
For example , it motivates creativity .
It increases our openness to change .
And our ability to learn .
We make us realize the features of things , and they &apos;re convinced — and they &apos;re two key incentives that increase productivity in work , through play .
So before you think of play as non-serious , play doesn &apos;t mean humor .
You know that professional sport that loves ski , is serious about it , but he loves it .
He enjoys his time , he passes on the stakes or skips on the slope .
The doctor may seem serious , but laughter is still a great drug .
We thought back and forth .
We shouldn &apos;t feel guilty .
We have to celebrate play .
A quick example from the business world .
FedEx : A simple slogan : people , service , profit .
If you treat people as people , if you treat them in a very good way , they &apos;re happier , satisfied , and they feel the meaning of purpose and mastery .
What happens ? They do better service — not worse , but better .
When clients call the company in order to serve what they &apos;re dealing with happy employees , they can make their decisions , and they &apos;re satisfied , what does customers feel ? They feel great .
Then , what do these fellow clients do , who felt that great feeling ?
They call you to buy another service , and they tell their friends that , which leads to more profit .
People , service , profit .
Play increases productivity , and it doesn &apos;t lack it .
You might say to me , &quot; &quot; Hey , this is possible in FedEx , there in the United States , not here in Bulgaria .
Impossible , we &apos;re completely different . &quot; &quot; This is possible , in Bulgaria , you have , for two reasons .
First of all , entertainment is universal .
Nothing odd prevents Bulgarians from entertainment , if we invest that collective thinking that we have to get rid of .
Secondly , because I tried , I tried in St. .
I went there , we had no happy customer .
It wasn &apos;t one customer to complain about our work .
I asked them all .
We had marginal profits — I did .
We had marginalized profits , and our partners were unstable .
Through some basic changes , changes , such as improving transparency , changes , like encouraging self-directions and collaboration , encouraging cooperation , not authoritarian , but the nature of the work underpins focus on outcomes .
I don &apos;t care when I came to work in the morning , or when I left .
What I &apos;m interested in is that your customer and your team are happy and you &apos;re organized around this .
Why should I care if I came to work at nine o &apos;clock in the morning ?
Basically foster pleasure .
Through enhancing fun , and a great business space we &apos;ve been able to transform St. and in a short period of about three years — it looks like it &apos;s a long time , but the change is slow — to a company where all the customers are constructed , when no one &apos;s ever done that before , plus the rate of profitable profits in the sector and enterprising partners .
Now you might ask , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you know they &apos;re encrypted ? Well , we &apos;ve won , over the years of our work , with one of the best categories in the category of small companies .
This is an independent analysis of employees who didn &apos;t explain their names on surveillance colonies .
This is possible , and it can work in Bulgaria .
Nothing distinguishes us , except our entertainment mindset .
So these are some steps that we can follow — to finish the subject — how we can revolutionize play .
First , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , well , go home and think about it a little bit .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t have that feeling of wanting to play and entertainment , you have to rediscover them .
Whatever it was when you were a kid , you were enjoying , but now when you got a paper , you couldn &apos;t enjoy , but now when you got a paper , you couldn &apos;t enjoy , because you felt you had to be serious , you discovered it again .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about riding a bike on the mountain , reading a book , playing a game .
He discovered it again . Because you are leaders , leaders of regeneration , leaders of thinking .
Because you have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and encourage the change in the play revolution .
You have to do this , and if you don &apos;t feel this , your colleagues and your employees can &apos;t feel it .
You have to go back to work , and you say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll trust you . &quot; &quot; A strange concept . I hired you . I have to trust you .
I &apos;ll let you make decisions , and I &apos;ll give you some tasks , and I &apos;ll explain some authorities to the lower levels , rather than the top .
I &apos;m going to encourage the construction critic .
I &apos;ll be able to challenge power .
Because by identifying the ways that we can break the protein that we live in and create creative solutions to the problems of today .
As leaders , we &apos;re not always right .
We &apos;re going to eliminate fear .
Fear is the enemy of entertainment .
And we &apos;re going to do some things like removing constraints .
You know something , let them use their phones to make personal talks — God &apos;s sport .
Let them use the Internet .
Let them get into the safe talks .
Let them take longer food .
Food is like a scandal of work .
When you go out to the world , you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you take a drink , you eat food , you talk , you get some linked ideas that you never had before .
Let them do that , give them some freedom . And in general , let them climb , let them enjoy where they work .
We spend most of our lives , in our workplace , and you &apos;re supposed to be what ? A desperate package until 20 years from now , you &apos;re going to wake up , and you say , &quot; Is that all it is ? &quot;
&quot; Is that all it was ? &quot; &quot; No acceptable . &quot; &quot; Nebromelia .
( Laughter ) And in short , we need a radical change in the way we think and our behavior , but we don &apos;t need a business revolution .
We don &apos;t need a business revolution .
What we need is the play sport . What we need is the execution of the players . What we need is the execution of the players .
I &apos;m serious now , we have to be a team together . Today is the beginning of the Intifada , but what we have to do is to promote the Revolution . You have to share with everybody the stories of your success .
It &apos;s about what was so hard to revitalize our lives , our schools , our business through entertainment , about how entertainment promotes the sense of hope and self-fulfillment ; promote regeneration and productivity ; and finally , how play creates meaning .
And because we can &apos;t do this alone , we have to do it together , and together if we do that , and we share these ideas about entertainment , we can change Bulgaria to the best .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , I want to start by giving you free advice , and all I need you to do is change the position of your skin for two minutes .
But before I give you a piece . I want to ask you now to look at your body and see what you &apos;re doing with it .
Well , how many of you are shrinking on your body and looking smaller ?
Sometimes we grab our arms like this .
Sometimes we expand our comfort . ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want you to notice very well what you &apos;re doing now .
So , we &apos;re very fascinated by the language of the body , and we &apos;re particularly interested .
You know , we &apos;re interested in weird things like this — ( Laughter ) with embarrassing motion or smile , or with a visceral look or maybe a very strange mystery , or maybe we care about something like a browser .
Narrator : Here they are , they &apos;re up to 10 Dunnings Street , and look at this .
Even the BBC and the New York Times .
So it &apos;s clear that when we think about non-verbal expressions or body language — but we call it non-verbal expressions as social scientists — it &apos;s a language itself , we think about communication .
And when we think about communication , we think about interaction .
And there are a lot of reasons why we think this is a way .
And we make inclusive judgments and we argue a lot about what &apos;s around us through the language of the body .
And through these judgments we can predict important outcomes in our lives like employing or nurturing or asking for an exit to a date .
For example , Nanny Empire , a researcher at the University of Texas , pointed out that when people watch 30 seconds of recorded intersections without sound , from the real interaction between the doctor and the patient , their governance at the level of the doctor &apos;s kindness indicates whether you &apos;re going to be interviewed or not .
If you don &apos;t use them a little bit — that &apos;s a bad idea , right ?
We &apos;re also influenced by our non-verbal expressions , our ideas , feelings and physiological functions .
So what are the non-verbal expressions that I &apos;m talking about ?
I &apos;m a psychologist , and I study prejudice and prejudice , and I study in one of the key business schools , so it was inevitable that I would be interested in the power mechanics .
And I became particularly interested in non-verbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are the non-verbal expressions of power and dominance ?
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s about expansion .
So you expand yourself and expand , you occupy space , and you basically open .
So it &apos;s about openness , and that &apos;s true .
This is a famous expression of pride , studied by Jaska Trey , and it shows that .
We &apos;re smaller than our size , and we don &apos;t want to be with those next to us .
And that &apos;s what happens when you combine high power .
If someone is dealing with us strongly , we tend to make ourselves smaller , we don &apos;t kill them .
And I see this behavior in the classroom , what did I notice ? I noticed that the MBA students .
And when they sit , they kind of post .
And you have other people actually collapse when they enter , and once they enter , you can see this collapse .
I &apos;ve noticed two things about this behavior .
Women often do these behaviors more than men .
Women always feel that they &apos;re less powerful and more robust than men . So that wasn &apos;t surprising , but there &apos;s something else I noticed .
And this is very important in the MBA class , because half of the end line depends on participation .
The business management mechanisms suffer from this gender gap .
So I started to wonder , you know , well , we have these people entering this way .
There &apos;s evidence that it affects .
So for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also when we &apos;re forced to smile when we hold a pencil like this , it makes us feel happy .
And the same is true of our sense of power .
So the second question was , you know , we know that our brains change and affect our bodies , but is it true that our bodies change and affect our minds ?
And when I say minds , in this case of power , what exactly am I talking about ?
So how do powerful people &apos;s minds differ versus ?
The powerful people tend to be ... &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s not surprising , &quot; &quot; much more confident and optimistic .
They actually feel like they &apos;re going to win even in things about chance and luck .
So there &apos;s a lot of difference . They &apos;re more risk .
But actually , power is also about how we act with stress .
So do you want that super-dominant leader , and the testosterone rate is high , but you &apos;re responding to stress ?
Probably not , right ? You want to be a diagnosis .
So we have this evidence , that just as the body can form the mind , at least at the surface level , these basic changes can shape the mind .
So what happens , well , take a change role , what happens if you do this thing at a very simple level , like this simple manipulation , this simple intervention ?
And here &apos;s another couple .
So it could be standing or sitting .
And here are the weak power positions .
So you involve yourself , you make yourself smaller .
You touch your neck .
So that &apos;s what happened . They come .
And that &apos;s it . That was the whole experience .
And this is what we came up with for the testosterone .
So again , two minutes , and you can get these changes .
This is what you get for Cortisol . People with great power .
So it seems that our non-verbal language is actually controlling not just the direction of others , but even ourselves .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
I mean that &apos;s what any attitudes you get to a social threat , where you &apos;re evaluated .
Again , this is not about you when you talk to others .
It &apos;s about you , talking to yourself , what do you do ?
Well , that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . It &apos;s filmed in it .
So for five minutes , nothing , and that &apos;s worse than being interrupted by speech .
People hate this . This is what Marian Lawrence calls .
Then we made programmers look at those recordings , four of them .
And the programmers were completely ignored for the hypothesis , and they ignored the circumstances .
It &apos;s about the appearance they showed in the talk .
These things . People bring what they really are .
So that &apos;s what drives the effect , or what connects the effect .
So I was telling them , &quot; &quot; Make it go . Don &apos;t want it . That &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there , and then I feel like I &apos;m getting nervous .
I don &apos;t want to feel invited .
It happened when I was nine years old , where I had a very bad car accident .
I got thrown out of the car , and I burned several times .
I threw out of the car , and I woke up , and I had my head .
And I was aware of my intelligence , because my ability was identified as smart and they were throwing on the talent heart as a child .
So I was separated from college , and I kept trying to go back to her .
And they said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t finish college .
I &apos;m inevitably .
You &apos;re going to stay , and all you have to do is .
I became what I wanted , I really do , so that &apos;s what I did , I spent five years at a university .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she feels that , and I know how that feeling is .
She can pretend that , until she becomes that .
So it &apos;s changed .
And what I want to tell you . Don &apos;t pretend to do it .
They protested it until they actually became .
Do it enough to be like that , and you understand it .
And the last thing I want to leave you with is this .
Small modifications can lead you to great changes .
So it &apos;s just two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s what you have to do . Hold your mind .
Make the testosterone go up . Make it go down .
Don &apos;t let the situation feel like , oh , I didn &apos;t see who I am .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Good creativity , sometimes , we need it .
Sharing . Good creativity is amazing , ridiculous , irrational , irrational .
Good creativity can spread tolerance and freedom and make education look like a brief idea .
( Laughter ) A good creativity can highlight deprivation or make it useless .
Good creativity can make politicians elected , or parties unwanted .
It can make war look like a tragedy or a sitcom .
Creativity is like a pen that writes logos on our shirt or phrases on our lips .
It &apos;s the explorer that shows us the simple way through the spiritual labyrinth .
Science is clever , but good creativity is a little bit less common , and more magical , and that &apos;s what we need now .
This is the time he needed it .
Our climate is changing very rapidly , very fast .
And good creativity is needed to do what is qualified for it : Keep thinking differently with the creative entities .
The temptation to behave differently with exhilarating creative touch .
This is one of them , a initiative from me that used creativity to motivate people to be friends of the environment .
Video : Man : You know , instead of driving the car today , I &apos;m going to walk .
Narrator : And he walked , while he saw things .
Strange , wonderful things that he never had .
My shadow broke his leg , a motorcycle flying .
The father and his son separated them from the bike , a strange wall .
And then she stops . She &apos;s in front of him .
The woman I grew up with was a little girl and she broke her heart .
Of course , I grew up a little bit .
In fact , I grew up a lot .
But he felt all his old ambition to come back .
Ford , call her kindly , that was her name .
She said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Jesse ... &quot; &quot; That was his name .
I know a tent next to the camp , 300 yards away from here .
Let &apos;s go there and do love . Ford &apos;s done it .
And I put it in my body while I photographed it , because it was visceral .
The Earth belonged to them .
And they lived together , happy forever .
That &apos;s because he decided to walk that day .
( Applause ) Andy Hopplumber : We had science , and we had a conversation .
The moral thing is that commitment is at the table .
The good creativity is needed to make it simple and fragile .
Until people get there , they get them to act .
This is a call , and he came to the talented TED community .
Let &apos;s employ creativity against climate change .
Let &apos;s do it sooner . Thank you !
( Applause )
BL : Well , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
Well , I &apos;m going to count , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
Well , one , two , three . Audience : Can you read this ?
BG : Amazing . And what about this ? One , two . Audience : You &apos;re not reading this .
PL : Okay . One , two . ( Laughter ) If you &apos;re a Portuguese , right ? What about this ? One , two .
Audience : What do you read ?
PL : What do you read ? There are no words .
I said , read what you see . Right ?
He literally says , &quot; &quot; Wow or Ray ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
And that &apos;s what should be said . Right ? Why is this ?
Because perception is based on our experience .
Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and creates meaning , which means we never see what &apos;s there , and we never see the information , we just see what was useful to see in the past .
Okay ? What it means is that when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) Right ? He &apos;s getting information . He &apos;s born useful behavior . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ah ! Ah ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) PL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go on our way , we get a little upset , right ?
But here we &apos;re talking about perception , right ?
And consciousness represents everything we think and know , and we believe in it , our hopes , our dreams and clothes that we wear , and fall in love , everything begins to realize .
Now if perception is based on our history , it means we &apos;re just responding to what we &apos;ve done before .
But in fact , that &apos;s a huge problem , because how do we ever see it differently ?
Now , I want to tell you a story about vision differently , and all the new perceptions that start the same way .
It starts with a question .
And the problem with questions is it creates a question .
Now , doubt is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionary terms that &apos;s bad . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s predator , it &apos;s going to be very late .
Right ? ( Laughter ) Even sea dialogue is a consequence .
Right ? If you go down on a boat , your inner ears tell you you &apos;re moving . And your eyes , and because they &apos;re moving with the boat , you say you &apos;re standing still .
Your brain can &apos;t deal with the odds of that information , so it &apos;s sick .
The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you to doubt .
And yet , the paradox is that the only way we can never do anything new is to step into this space .
So how can we ever do something new ? Well luckily , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And we &apos;ve been able to tackle even the hardest questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most exotic .
It &apos;s the ones that doubt things that we think are true , right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how life begins , or what extends beyond the universe , but to ask what you think is really true is to actually enter into that space .
So what is the answer to evolution to the problem of doubt ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not just a process . Play experts will tell you that it &apos;s actually a lifestyle .
Play is one of the human endeavors where doubt is actually celebrated , doubt is what makes play fun .
Right ? It &apos;s adapted to change . Right ? It opens up possibility , and it &apos;s collaborative . It &apos;s actually our way of social connectedness , and it &apos;s fundamentally driven . What that means is that we play for play . Play is the reward of itself .
Now if you look at these five ways of life , these are exactly the same ways that you need to be a good world .
Science is not defined by the curriculum in scientific research .
It &apos;s actually a lifestyle , it &apos;s here , and that &apos;s true of everything creative .
If you add rules to play , you have a game .
And that &apos;s actually what the experience is .
So , armed with these two ideas , that science is a lifestyle , and that experiences are games , we wondered , could anyone become a scientist ?
And better to ask him from 25 to 10 years old ?
Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took a cell to a small school in Dave , and the goal of that was not just to get kids to look at science differently , but to see themselves in a different way through the curriculum of science . Right ?
And the first step was to ask a question .
Now , I &apos;d like to say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because scientists said that little kids couldn &apos;t give a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So , here are some questions . I put them in a little book so you don &apos;t get tired of reading them . The point is that five of the questions that children put were actually the basis of scientific publication in the last five to 15 years . Right ?
So they were asking important questions for experts .
Now here , I want to share the wood with a very special person , right ?
It was one of the young people who participated in this study , and it &apos;s now one of the smallest scientists ever published in the world . Right ? It &apos;s going to be now , once it gets to the stage , the smallest person ever talks at TED . Right ?
Now , science and asking questions about courage .
Now it &apos;s an embodiment of courage , because it &apos;s going to stand here , and talk to you all .
Well Aimee , please prefer me . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Aimee &apos;s going to help me tell the story what we call the Blakton Bee Project , and you &apos;re going to first tell you the question they thought about , prefer Aimee .
AM : Thank you so much . We thought it was easy to see the connection between humans and apes in the way we think about it , because we seem to be equal .
But we wondered if there was a relationship with other animals , it would be amazing if humans and bees were thinking similarly , where it seemed very different from us .
So we thought about whether humans and bees could solve complex problems in the same way .
Really , we wanted to know if bees could also adapt themselves to new cases using the monologues used earlier . What if bees could think like us ?
Well , that would be amazing , because we &apos;re talking about a insect that only has a million brain cells .
It &apos;s actually going to make sense that you can , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of the day , the light , the weather , or from any angle close to it . ( Applause ) PL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids designed this experiment , and so — well , it &apos;s a game — AM , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle you put to bees ?
EA : The puzzle we came up with was the rule of if ...
We asked bees to learn not only to go to a particular color , but to a particular color flower when it &apos;s in a particular pattern .
They were only paid if they went to yellow flowers if yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or if blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
There are many different rules that bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question was , you know ?
What was really exciting about this project was that , Boo , he had no idea whether this was going to work .
It was completely new , and nobody had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) PL : including teachers , and that was really hard for teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a world to continue and have no idea what it &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — a lot of people go back to Dave Strawick , who was cooperative in this project . Okay ?
So I &apos;m not going to go into the full detail of the study because you can actually read about it , but the next step is surveillance . Here are some students doing observations , and they record where bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strawick : So what are we going to do — student : Five .
DJ : Are you still going up here ? DM : Yes .
Dave Strowick : Okay , so let &apos;s watch each of them . student : Henry , can you help me here ?
PL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist says that , right ?
Teacher : There are two there .
And three here .
PL : Right ? So we have our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
They do simple mathematics , on average , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this , and we &apos;re going to try to send it to publication . Right ? So we &apos;ve got to write it .
And so we did , of course , go to the pub . Right ? ( Laughter ) The glass on the left is my property , OK ? ( Laughter ) Now , I told them , the scientific research has four different sections : introduction and presentation to methods and results and discussions .
The front is talking about the question and why ?
And he showed the methods of what we did ? The results , what was the observation ?
And the discussion , who cares ? Right ?
That &apos;s the scientific research , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids gave me the words , right ? And I put them in a narrative context , which means that this paper is written in children &apos;s language .
I &apos;m not a writer . It &apos;s written by Aimee and other students in the class . As a result , this paper starts like this , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results department says , &quot; &quot; The training phase , the puzzle — oh my goodness . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And showing the methods , he says , &quot; &quot; Then we put bees in the refrigerator . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Seriously , we &apos;re going to try this paper .
Well this is the title page . We have a number of authors there .
All those in the broad line are for those of you who are eight to 10 years old .
The first author is &quot; &quot; elementary schools of Blackton , &quot; &quot; because if they &apos;ve ever been referred to it , it &apos;s going to be &quot; &quot; plason and others . &quot; &quot; And not one . So we sent it to a public circulation , and they said this . They said a lot of things , but he said this .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper didn &apos;t reach our primary quality standards in many different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it begins with the phrase &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; &quot; and the drawings were in color markers , etc . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to review them . &quot; We went to Dave Porse , which is in &quot; &quot; National Academy of Science , &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the leading neuroscientists , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is absolutely the most popular book .
Larry Milton , the expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is awesome .
And the work is going to be publicly scalable if the adult did it . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sent it back to the editor .
They said no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hamble to write a commentary that puts the results to scientists , right , by putting the reference , and we presented it to biology messages .
And there , it was reviewed by five independent governors , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took us four months to do the science side , two years to publish it . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s applied in science , actually , right ? And that makes Aimee and her youngest publisher scientists in the world .
How did the reactions look like ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , it was downloaded for 30,000 times the first day , right ?
It was the choice of editors in Sennis , a classified scientific journal .
It &apos;s available to free access by biology messages .
It &apos;s the only scientific paper that will be available for free by this cycle .
Last year , the second most updated scientific paper in biology letters , and comments were not only by scientists but by teachers and the audience as well .
I &apos;m just going to read one .
I read &quot; &quot; Plakton Bee recently . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have phrases that I describe what I feel right now .
What you did , real guys , healthy and amazing .
Curiosity , attention , innocence and enthusiasm are the basis and one of the most important things to do with science .
And who doesn &apos;t have these characteristics ?
Please hire your kids &apos; team on behalf of me . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
Can I try it for you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yes , yes , come on . Yes . Yes . Okay .
Now , science is associated with risk , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , it &apos;s not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve done this once . ( Laughter ) And you love technology , right ?
Chimon Schawken : Yeah , but I love myself .
BG : That &apos;s an example of technology . Right . Okay .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to show you a little demo , right ?
You have to cover your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . Okay ?
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Okay , what if all the audience screamed there . One , two ?
Audience : ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) Excellent . Now , open your eyes . And you &apos;ll do it again .
Everyone is screaming . ( screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What is the phrase ? The phrase is what science does with us .
Right ? We usually live our lives responding , but if we ever want to do something different , we have to step toward doubt . When his eyes opened , he was able to see the world in a new way .
And that &apos;s what science offers us . It provides the possibility of stepping towards doubt through the play process , right ?
Now , I think the real education of science has to be associated with giving people a voice and empowering them to express that voice , and so I asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
Well , Aimee ?
EA : This project was really exciting to me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it turns out that anyone , I mean anyone , has the ability to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a big discovery .
Changing the way someone thinks about something can be easy or hard . Everything stops on the way one feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was astonishing . Once we played games , then I started thinking about this puzzle , I realized then that science is not just a boring subject , and that anybody can discover something new .
I just needed a chance . I had the opportunity in the form of a bo , and a beekeeping project .
Thank you . BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I want to talk about is actually the biggest problems in the world .
And I &apos;m not going to talk as &quot; &quot; environmental geeks , &quot; &quot; and I think that &apos;s a good choice as well .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;m going to talk about what are these big problems facing our world .
And I have to ask you , before I start , I have to ask each of you personally to find a heart and a paper , because I &apos;m going to ask you for help .
So bring a paper and a pen .
We all know that there are a lot of problems in this world .
And I &apos;m going to show you a few of them .
There are 800 million hungry people around the world .
There are a billion people living without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation services .
Other million people suffer from HIV .
And the list grows .
There are two billion people who are going to suffer from climate change , and so on .
There are many , many problems in the outside world .
And in a perfect world , we will solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t really solve all these problems .
And so , we have to ask ourselves a question — as if we &apos;re restricted with financial constraints — we can say , if we can &apos;t solve all of these problems , what &apos;s the first problem we have to begin to solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I want to ask you .
If we have , 50 billion dollars now , how are we going to spend it in the next four years to benefit the world around us , where are we going to spend it and what ?
I &apos;ve identified 10 big problems facing our world , and I &apos;ll just briefly read it to you , climate change , infectious diseases , conflict , economic crisis , government corruption , government corruption , malnutrition , hunger , migration of sanitation , lack of water , financial storms and trade barriers .
I think these are generally the biggest problems in the world around us .
And the obvious question here is , what are the most important problems ?
And which one should we start to solve ?
But this is wrong .
And this was the real problem we had in Davos in January .
Because of course , there &apos;s a problem with getting people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve it .
Of course the biggest problem in this world is that we are artists and we will die someday .
And let &apos;s have the technology to solve that , right ?
So the point I &apos;m trying to get to is not just classifying problems , but classifying solutions to those problems .
And that would — of course that would make it more complicated .
To solve climate change , the answer would be to make the world like Kito , a city in Japan .
And to solve the problem of infectious diseases , the answer would be health centers or bed nets .
And for conflict , the answer will be the U.N. forces to save peace and so on .
And what I want you to do now is try , in 30 seconds — and I know it makes sense — an impossible task — to write on the paper what you think is one of the most important priorities .
And also — that , of course , even though it &apos;s evil — what are the things we should not do , at least first .
What problem should be at the end of the priorities list ?
Please , just 30 seconds , you can talk to people next to you , and try to figure out what are the most important priorities and what are the least important problems we should consider to be the most important problems in our world .
The amazing part of this stage — and of course , I mean , I want to — I just have 18 minutes , and I &apos;ve given you a good split of my time , right ?
I want you to engage with me , to realize what this mechanism is , and that &apos;s exactly what we did .
And I highly encourage you to do this , and I &apos;m sure we can discuss this later , to think together how do we prioritize these priorities ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself first , why is this list not really there on the ground ?
And the only reason is that priorities are often uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do that .
Of course , every organization wants to be at the top of the list .
But at the same time , they hate not to be on the top of the list .
And as long as there are so many problems that don &apos;t occupy the first order on the list and that there &apos;s only one organization that will follow the list , it makes sense not to do a list like the one we &apos;re talking about .
So for example , we have the United Nations 60 years ago , but we haven &apos;t done a real list of big problems that we want to change in this world , and we haven &apos;t identified , which of those things should we do at the beginning ?
But that doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no category of things around us — because any idol decision itself , of course we &apos;re still classifying . If that &apos;s just done — and that &apos;s not good enough if we actually identified those priorities , and we discussed them and talked about them .
So I suggest that we imagine that we have , for a long time , a problem when we had a list of choices .
There &apos;s so much , what we can do , but we didn &apos;t have the cost , we didn &apos;t even have the measurements required for it .
We had no idea about them .
So imagine you &apos;re in a restaurant and you have a big food list , but you don &apos;t know how much food you have .
You can ask pizza because it &apos;s on the list , but you don &apos;t know what it costs .
It could be one dollar , it could be 1,000 dollars .
And it might be a family size , or it &apos;s just one chip , right ?
We all want to know these things : cost and scale .
And this is what Copenhagen was trying to do , which is to enhance these issues .
And basically that &apos;s what the Copenhagen meeting tried to do .
He &apos;s offered the top 30 economies in the world , three in every field .
So we had the best three local economists to write about climate change .
And figure out what to do ? What is the cost of this work ? What are the complexities and benefits to it ?
And so also in infectious diseases .
Three of the most important experts to determine us , what should we do ?
And what is the cost of this work ?
And how to fix the problem , and what are the threats and the threats ?
And so ...
And then we made some of the best economists in the world , eight of them specifically , including three Nobel Prize winners , met in Copenhagen in May of 2004 .
We called them the Dream team , and the University of Cambridge decided to call them the Ryal Economic team .
And the name resonated very well in Europe , except he didn &apos;t get this improvement here .
And what this particular team did was to come up with a priority list .
And then you ask , why are economists ?
And I &apos;m , of course , very happy because you asked this question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very important question .
The idea , of course , is that if you want to know something about malaria , you ask an expert in malaria .
And if you want to know something about climate , you &apos;re going to ask news about it .
But if you want to know which of those things you have to treat first , you can &apos;t ask any of them , because it &apos;s not their job .
And that &apos;s what economists do .
They limit priorities .
They don &apos;t like most , what should you care about first , and what should you do next ?
And here &apos;s the list , which they came up with that I want to share with you .
Of course , you can also look at it with the electronic address , and we &apos;ll talk a little bit more about it later on this day .
They actually went out on a list where they said there are a few loser projects — basically , projects — if you invest one dollar , you get less of them .
And there are balanced projects , there are profitable and profitable projects .
And of course , that very profit is the one we have to start with .
And I &apos;m going to start with you from the bottom of the list to end with very profitable projects .
And these were projects that were losing their perspective .
And as you can see , climate change is in the tail of the list .
And that might be bad for many people , which is one of the things that causes people to not trust going back , too .
And I &apos;m going to talk about this , because it &apos;s really interesting .
Why did climate change come here ?
And I &apos;m going to try to come back to this too , because it &apos;s often one of the things that we &apos;re going to disagree with based on the list that you wrote earlier .
What made them say that making the world a city of Kyoto — or doing better than Kyoto — is simply lost because it &apos;s an inefficient way .
They don &apos;t say climate change is actually not an accident .
And it &apos;s not a big problem either .
But they say that what we can do about it is relatively small , for the cost of the problem .
What they showed us , most of the economic models gathered , is that if Cyoto &apos;s solution depended , if everyone agreed , it would be about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a lot of money .
It &apos;s actually about two to three times the amount of global development that normally behave to the third world every year .
It &apos;s only going to affect a very good job .
And the conservative models of the problem say that this amount is going to stop global warming for six years since 2100 .
So the person who lives in Bangladesh can avoid a sunset of six years .
Which is good , but it &apos;s not good enough .
And the idea I &apos;m trying to make to you is , we &apos;re going to spend in this case a very large amount compared to the expected achievement .
And we can see the biggest number when we know , the United Nations estimates only half of this money , which is about 75 billion dollars a year , to solve most of the big problems in the world .
That amount can provide clean water , good sanitation and basic health services as well as teaching everyone on this planet .
So we can ask ourselves , again , do we want to spend twice this money doing a little bit of good achievement ?
Or should we just spend half of it in order to make a huge amount of accomplishments ?
And that &apos;s why the climate crisis became a huge project .
That doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not going to fix this problem , if enough resources are available .
But we say that right now it &apos;s not in the most powerful priorities based on economic values .
And the fair projects — and I &apos;m not going to stick on all of these — but the problem of infectious diseases , the right health services — made them , simple , yes , the size of basic health services is a great thing .
This will provide a very large service , but it &apos;s also very expensive .
And again , this tells us that it &apos;s the beginning of our start thinking about the implications of this equation .
And if we look at successful projects , we &apos;ll find that water and sanitation projects will appear on the list .
And it &apos;s true that water and sanitation is very important , but it requires a lot of infrastructure .
So I want to show you the first four priorities that have been identified that we have to start to address immediately when we talk about how to deal with problems in the world .
The problem of malaria kills the fourth center — the problem with malaria .
That affects about two million people every year .
And it can cost to one percent of the GDP per year of developing countries .
But if we invest 13 billion dollars in the next four years , the rate of infection will fall in half .
And we &apos;re going to save half a million people dying , and most importantly , we &apos;re going to avoid nearly a billion people dying every year .
And that &apos;s going to increase their ability to deal with other problems that we have to deal with around them , and of course , in the long term dealing with the global warming problem .
The third center is free trade .
And this model in front of you is that if we can liberate trade , and especially stop the support for goods in the United States and Europe , we &apos;re going to extend the global economy as a very large number of 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of it will go back to the third world .
Again , the importance here is that we can lift about 2- to three million people from extreme poverty , rapidly , within a period of two to five years .
And this will be the third best thing we can do .
The second thing we can do is focus on malnutrition .
Not just overall malnutrition , but also in a cheap way to deal with malnutrition , official , lack of basic needs in food .
Basically , half the world is suffering from a lack of iron , zinc , Jews and vitamin A.
And if we invest 12 billion dollars , this will make a huge impact on the problem and solve it .
So this is the second best thing to do .
The best thing to intervene is to focus on AIDS .
And if we invest about 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we will protect nearly 28 million people with HIV .
And again , this suggests that there are two ways of dealing with AIDS .
The first is treatment , the second is prevention .
And in a perfect world we can do things together .
But in a world that doesn &apos;t do anything at all , or does one at low efficiency , we have to choose one way to interfere with that problem first .
And given that treatment is much more expensive than prevention .
The committee suggested that the greatest achievement would be to invest in prevention .
So the amount that we &apos;re going to spend , on treatment , we can do much more than the variability , but it will benefit 10 times that variation if we &apos;re spending on prevention .
So again , focusing on prevention rather than treatment , is the beginning .
This is what I showed us thinking about our own childhood .
I want each of you to look at his first list and say , are you what you wrote right ?
Or is it a little closer than I &apos;m showing you here ?
Of course , climate change is one of the most important things secondary .
I find a lot of you find that , it &apos;s wrong to walk this order .
And they say we have to deal with climate change , if not for another reason , at least because it &apos;s a very big problem .
But of course we can &apos;t deal with all the problems .
Our world is full of problems .
And what I want to emphasize , is that if we focus on problems , it &apos;s the problems that we really need to focus on .
And we can do a lot more with it than we can &apos;t do much about it .
And I really think that Thomas Shirling is one of the participants in the dream team , he organized it very well .
One of the things that we &apos;ve forgotten a lot is that in 100 years , when we think that the effect of global change is going to be the biggest on us , people will be at the time wealthier .
According to the most common visualization , the U.N.
You expect the average person in the developing world to be 2100 times as rich as we are right now .
And very likely , about two to four times what we are right now .
And of course we &apos;re also going to be much wealthier than we are now .
But the idea here is that when we talk about human rescue , or helping people in Bangladesh , for example , in 2100 , we haven &apos;t talked about poor people in Bangladesh .
We &apos;re talking about the rich average person in the Netherlands .
So the reality here raises a question , do we really want to spend a lot of money to help a few , in the next hundred years to help the Dutch average ?
Or do we really want to help the real poor , now , in Bangladesh , who actually needs our help ? And who will we help , at least as much as possible ?
And as Chile said , imagine yourself a rich person — as it would be — rich from China or from Bolivia or from Congo in 2100 by looking back at 2005 , wouldn &apos;t you say , &quot; &quot; How strange are their big attention ? &quot; &quot; So they helped us a little bit about global warming , and they got a little bit simpler and my great-great-grandfather , who they could help him more , so how much more help ? &quot; &quot; I think that really tells us why we should prioritize it .
Even if we &apos;re not allowed to conceive of how important these problems are .
And of course , what caused them is that issues like global warming have good images .
We &apos;ve all seen in &quot; &quot; The Day Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it was a great movie , right ?
It was a great film in photography that I wanted to see , right , but I don &apos;t think the director Ronald Emerch uses Brad Pitt in his next film , and he digs sanitation channels in Tanzania or so — ( Laughter ) — this issue is not for a good movie .
So in many ways , I see that the Copenhagen Forum and all that had happened in conversations about priorities were defense of these boring problems .
And it will make us sad to realize that solving these things is not about feeling comfortable .
It &apos;s not about bringing a big media noise , it &apos;s about actually making change in its right place very effectively .
And the other assumptions , which I think are important and should say is that I or we are always always selecting wrong .
Right , we have to solve the hunger of these problems , in a perfect world — I &apos;ll certainly agree with you .
I think we should be interested in everything , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided to describe twice as much as we are , now , more than 1970s on the developing world .
Since then , our equipment has halved .
So it looks like we &apos;re not on the right way to solve all these problems once .
On the other hand , some people will say what about the Iraq War ?
We spent about 100 billion dollars . Why haven &apos;t we spent this money serving our world ?
And I &apos;m with you in that .
And if anybody can talk to George Bush about that , that &apos;s good .
But what &apos;s important here is that if we get another 100 billion dollars , we have to make sure that it &apos;s the best possible way , right ?
And the fundamental issue here is to go back to ourselves and think very well about the most important and true priorities .
But I want to just briefly ask , is that the list really true ?
You know , we &apos;ve consulted the best economists , and you &apos;re probably going to end up asking an older white man .
And they &apos;re not necessarily — you know — they don &apos;t have the best view they can look at for the world .
So we invited 80 young people from all over the world to discuss and solve the same problem .
And there were first acceptance partners that they were studying in college , and the second was that they were speaking English at all .
Most of them were from developing countries .
Everybody got the same data , but they could look at it from other perspectives and so what they did , they came out with their own list .
And surprisingly , it was very similar to the ones we have — it was malnutrition and malaria at the top and climate change at the bottom of the list .
And we &apos;ve done this a lot of times .
They have different universities and in conferences from multiple directions .
And they were all coming out almost the same list .
And that gives me a great hope to say that I believe that we &apos;re on the right path as well as thinking about our priorities , and in particular what is the most important thing in the world ?
And of course , I repeat that in a perfect world , we will solve everything .
But if we can &apos;t do that , we have to think about what we should start first ?
And I see Copenhagen meeting as progress .
We did it in 2004 , and I hope it will attract many people , to the next conference in 2008 , which is next in 2012 .
Let &apos;s map the right road map of the world , and let &apos;s also start thinking about political priorities .
And let &apos;s think , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s work not with those things that cost a lot and produce a little bit , and not with those things that we don &apos;t know yet to do , but let &apos;s do those things that if we make a wonderful impact on the world at low cost and at the moment . &quot; &quot; And finally you can differentiate with this way we &apos;ve identified these priorities , but we have to be honest and committed , when we say you &apos;re doing something else .
And if we get too worried about some things , it &apos;s going to end up not worrying about something else .
So in closing , I hope this helps us define our ideal priorities , and to make us think about how we can use the world in a better way .
Thank you .
A small and odd invention is being talked about .
It &apos;s called the microscope .
What you &apos;re allowed to do is see very small organisms that don &apos;t see the naked eye .
A little bit later , a medical discovery will come out that many of these organisms form a cause of serious human diseases .
Imagine what happened to the community when he realized that the mother of English and in her tea was actually drinking a soup full of germs . Not far from here . This was in London .
200 years later .
These germs are still around us and are still controlling their grip on developing countries around the tropics .
Just for malaria , there are a million deaths every year , and more than a billion people need to diagnose because they &apos;re exposed to different kinds of malaria infections .
Now , in fact , it &apos;s very easy to recognize many of these germs .
You take a formula , for example , the oranges of oranges , the Florida or the beautiful , and so on , to look at it .
They all have faces .
There was still Alex from Kenya , and he died in Bangladesh , and a bomb in Mumbai , Julie and Mary in Uganda waiting months to be diagnosed to know why they were patients ?
And this is in the first place , because diagnosis is is so far from the place .
And remember that number : a billion .
The problem is in the microscope itself .
Although modern science is at the top of a face , it &apos;s a research microscope that &apos;s not designed for field tests .
It wasn &apos;t even designed to make a diagnosis at all .
It &apos;s heavy , it &apos;s hard to take care of and it costs a lot of money .
This is the image of Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s , and he &apos;s using the same way that we use today to diagnose malaria in his laboratory in Savatar India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , all over India and Thailand , and they started thinking about this problem a lot .
We saw all kinds of donor equipment .
We saw fungi growing on the lens of the microscope .
And we saw people who had a practical microscope , but they didn &apos;t know how to run it .
What came out of this work and this journey was really the idea that we call folded microscopes .
What is a folded microscope ?
The folded microscope is a completely practical microscope , a platform for radioactivity and luminescence and polarization , and projection , all kinds of advanced microscopes made out of a folded paper .
So you &apos;re thinking , how is this possible ?
I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we &apos;re going to go through them very quickly .
It starts with one piece of paper .
What you see here is all possible ingredients to build the luminescent microscope and the radiation microscope .
So , there are three stages : there &apos;s the visual stage , the lighting phase and the mask phase .
And there are little sticks down there that are part of the paper itself .
What you do is you take it , and just like you play with a game , and it &apos;s really like that , press it , and separate it .
This paper has no instructions or languages .
There &apos;s a code , a colored code , tells you how to cover that particular microscope .
When it &apos;s ready , it looks kind of like this , it has all the functions of a perfect microscope , like a Stage Page . A place where a sample can put , for example , here .
We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that has been improved over the years , and many health workers have been used to it .
So that &apos;s what has changed , but ideal pigments are still the same for many different diseases .
You enter it very quickly .
There &apos;s a phase of text , and then the focus phase , which is the folding mechanism that &apos;s built in the paper itself to allow us to move and focus the lenses with the micron steps .
And what &apos;s really interesting about this thing , which is what my students hate to do , but I &apos;m going to do it anyway , these are expensive devices .
I can turn it on and throw it on the ground and really try to put my foot on it .
And it lasts a long time , even though they &apos;ve designed a flexible material , like paper .
And another interesting fact , here &apos;s what we &apos;re actually sending out there as a traditional diagnostic tool , but here in this situation I have 30 different types of microscopes that are embedded from all kinds of structures , all in one file .
And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
This , it turns out , is designed specifically for malaria , because it has radioactive filters designed specifically to diagnose malaria .
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes emerged through this .
So far , you haven &apos;t really seen what I &apos;m going to see through one of these devices .
So what I &apos;d like to do is , can we make light light light light light light light , please . It also turns out that the folded microscopes are also the microscopes of falling .
I have these two little microscopes that I &apos;m going to run — and I &apos;m going to go behind the wall — and just show you , and in this way you &apos;ll see exactly what I &apos;m going to see .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) This is a cross-section of an eye gatherer , and when you zoom in more , there is , through the axis of a disk .
You actually see how the lenses are cut together in my presentation pattern .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I like to hate this one , it &apos;s a mosquito , and you see an antenna with a cholyx mosquito .
There .
All of this is through the simple numbers I described .
My wife recently tested Medani for some of our labs by washing my clothes when I forget her in the hospital machine .
So it turns out it &apos;s anti-water , and — ( Laughter ) here I have radioactive water , and I don &apos;t really know if you can see this .
And this also shows you how the projection range works .
You can see the light and the way it &apos;s presented and curved .
Can you bring light back please ?
I &apos;m going to show you very quickly , given that I don &apos;t have a lot of time , in terms of the cost of manufacturing , the big idea was to be made in a finite circuit way , so we designed it at a cost of 50 cents that includes pieces and costs .
( Applause ) And what we can do is think of a new paradigm in the microscope that we call the microscope , &quot; Use it and draw it . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you a quick glimpse of some of the pieces that you use .
This is a piece of paper .
This was when we thought about the idea .
This is a 44 paper .
These three stages that you see .
And the visual ingredients , if you look at the ingredient at the top on the right , we had to find a way to manufacture the lens in the paper itself with high productivity , so it uses the self-assembly process and the pressed surface to build a color lens in the paper itself .
Here &apos;s where the lens are .
There are sources of light .
And basically , ultimately , all the parts of the origami form , because origami can get accuracy at the micron level of visual stimulation .
Even though it looks like a simple game , the geometric aspects of it are fairly sophisticated .
There &apos;s another obvious thing that we might do , usually , if I want to show that these little microscopes are strong , I &apos;ll go to the third role and throw them out of there .
It &apos;s there , and it &apos;s survived .
So for us , the next step is to end our field experiences .
We &apos;re going to start at the end of the summer .
We &apos;re at a stage in which we &apos;re going to make thousands of microscopes .
That will be the first time we &apos;re going to do field trials at the highest density of microscopes ever in a particular place .
We started collecting data on malaria , the performance of the American tribes and the neighbors of the patients themselves .
And I want to leave you with this picture .
To plan this before , there &apos;s a really interesting connection between actual participation in science and global health education .
What tools are we presenting to kids who are going to fight these germs tomorrow ?
I like to have the ability to print the folded microscope and carry it with them in their pocket .
Thank you .

Our world is full of superheroes .
But these live under a painful reality : the fact of marginalization .
The emergence of a college class of waste reflected on social inequality and unemployment , solid waste and labor deficit of a waste collection system .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of the recycled waste .
Most garbage collectors work independently collecting waste from the streets , and then selling it in the courtyard with very cheap prices .
They collect over 300 kilos in their backpacks and shopping carts and bicycles and Brazilian carriers .
I &apos;m an artist and an activist and an artist who is a social art , an ecologist and a political character .
In 2007 , I launched my work beyond running to Brazilian carriers &quot; &quot; Carropolas &quot; &quot; as a civilizational support for my letter .
At that time , the idea was delivered to the garbage collectors .
They are now from celebrity in a place : in roads , in public and social media .
For this thing , I drove in this world and I didn &apos;t stop working .
I drew over 200 Carropolas in many cities and invited to create exhibitions and travel around the world .
And then I learned that the waste collectors in the Daissance case , are not governors in Brazil .
I joined the garbage collectors in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey , and even in developed countries like America and Japan .
So I realized that I needed a lot of individuals to join that issue because it was a big challenge .
After that , I created a cooperative movement called &quot; &quot; My Beautiful Me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) — massively funded .
Thank you .
( Applause )
My great &quot; &quot; My Beautiful &quot; &quot; is a massive massive public movement to help waste collectors with their carts .
In addition to helping them professionally and healthily , like providing services from doctors , dentists , children , poetry and professionals and more .
In addition , garbage collectors also receive our shells and realistic gloves and sunglasses and realistic emotions from the rain so we can see the city really , whereas their cars are being painted by our wonderful volunteers .
Also , garbage collectors have received elements of safety as reflective tapes of light , markets and mirrors .
My own garbage project moved to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
So to become another city requirement outside Brazil , we &apos;ve created a project that &apos;s inspired by TEDx , a simpler project , doing itself , which is another picture of my garbage project .
Now everybody can join .
In two years , more than 170,000 waste collectors and 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 10,000 donors joined my own garbage warrior movement that used to work in teaching recycling to local schools .
So the waste collectors now leave the margins behind them to become more respectable and more appreciative .
Because , with their wedding wedding , they &apos;re able to fight in the face of the crowd by increasing their physical income and their interactions in society .
Now I challenge you to reconsider waste collectors and other hidden heroes in your city .
To believe it or not in the world , over 20 million waste collectors .
Thank you very much .
About a year and a half ago Stephen Luler , who also spoke here at TED in 2007 about virtual Earth , encouraged me to become an engineer in Bing Maps , which is an effort from Microsoft to map the Internet .
In the last two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working really hard to redefine the way maps work online .
And we actually see that through very different terms of this kind of map site and trends that people used to use .
So , the first thing you might notice about the mapping site , is the easy to zoom in and rotate , which , if you &apos;re familiar with Birdson , comes from there .
The mapping is , of course , not just a mapping , it &apos;s also a photography .
So , as we &apos;re zooming above a certain level , it takes us to a kind of like a SETI in a virtual show of 45 degrees .
And you can see it from any trend of the fundamental trends to show you the three-dimensional structure of the city , and all the interfaces .
Now , we see this region , and this three-dimensional environment that looks like a painting that all sorts of applications are being conducted , and the map points are actually just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of those that we showed , just in the last two months , since we launched .
So , for example , two days after the catastrophe happened in Haiti , we had the earthquake map that showed prehistoric images and after the earthquake taken from the sky .
This wonderful app that I don &apos;t have time to show you takes local blogs active in real time and mapping those stories , those insertions into places that are referred to in blogs .
It &apos;s fantastic .
But I &apos;m going to show you some of the most fun things .
So , we see photography , of course , doesn &apos;t stop in the sky .
These little green bubbles represent the photeniphing instructions that users put .
I &apos;m not going to go through it too , but phototorites are incorporated into the map .
All that &apos;s covered in blue is one of the areas that we &apos;ve taken pictures of on the ground as well .
And so , when you land ( Applause ) Thank you . When you land on the ground , you see this kind of panoramic photography , the first thing you might notice is that not just a photograph , there &apos;s a 3D appreciation in this environment equivalent to the three-dimensional appreciation of the city from the top , so if you click on something to get a closer demo than that , then , the fact that this transition looks like actually , is the job of all those geometric , all those three-dimensional dimensions behind this model .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a really interesting application that we &apos;re working on collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
This app takes a hologram of Flickr and uses photosynth analogies to connect that photography to our photography , so — I &apos;m not sure if this is what I mean to show , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — and this is , of course , a famous tourist site , and there are a lot of images around us , and I &apos;ve taken all these pictures at different times .
This picture was taken at about five o &apos;clock .
This is Flickr &apos;s picture , and this is our picture .
So you actually see how these kinds of images are integrated that people have taken in a very profound way , on the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why it &apos;s interesting , one of them , of course , is the time it takes to travel .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the great historical imaging here , but there are some images of horses and buggies as well .
But what &apos;s great about this app is that , not only does it inflate this visual representation of the world with things that come from users , but it &apos;s also the foundation for inflating reality , which I &apos;ll show you more in a moment .
I &apos;ve now moved inside . This is also interesting .
Well , notice that there &apos;s a ceiling above us .
We &apos;re inside the Pike Pace .
And this is something we can do with a laptop camera , so , we &apos;re not just photographing on the street with this camera on the rooftops of cars , but we &apos;re also photographing inside .
And from here , we can do the same kind of recording , not just from static images , but also from video .
And this is something that we &apos;re going to try now for the first time , in a live transmission and this is really , really , very scary .
( Laughter ) Okay .
( Ringing ) Okay , guys , are you there ?
( Cheers ) Okay , now I &apos;m going to press the button .
I &apos;m on a live transmission . Okay . Here we are .
So , these are our friends at the Pike Place , the lab .
( Applause ) And they &apos;re broadcast directly to us .
Well , George , can you turn back into the market corner ?
Because I want to show the interesting points .
No , no . The other side .
Yes , yes . Go back to the corner . Go back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
Okay . Okay . Get back . Get back . Get back .
Okay . Don &apos;t worry .
What I wanted to show you was these interesting points from here on the top of the picture because the feeling that gives you is the way , if you &apos;re really balanced in the place — you can think about this — is taking a step as well as amplifying reality .
What guys — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re working on two different things — well , I &apos;m going to close the line now .
We &apos;re working on two different things here .
One is to take this ...
( Laughter ) Well , let me pause a moment to thank the team .
They did a fantastic job .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to give them away now and go out .
And as I walk outside , I &apos;m going to point out here , we &apos;re using the property of being on the distance of the Telephone resburg , but you can use it instantly , in inflation of reality .
When you use it immediately , that means you &apos;re able to show all that definition and that information around the world for you .
And here , we &apos;re taking the additional step in its broadcast as well .
That we see , by the way , on the 4G network of the market .
Well , there &apos;s another TED Talk that Microsoft gave in the last few years .
And he gave the talk Kerts Wong , Word and Wild Telescope .
And now we go to where it &apos;s traditionally , after a long day in the market , going out into a space , but also investigating in the sky .
And this is the Lawrence Wald Telescope in our maps .
( Applause ) This is — thank you — this is the current time , but if we move time , then we can see the sky differently than time , and we can get all this information about different times and different history . Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe we change history .
I &apos;d like to zoom in .
This is an entire astronomical representation of the sky integrated with the Earth .
Well now , my time is over , so I have to stop .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about two things today that we &apos;ve lost , and the other is the way we &apos;re going to restore it .
And let me start with this ?
This is the baseline of this is the Mediterranean coast of fish , and it &apos;s naked , and a lot of sea urchins that feed on algae .
Something like this is the first thing I saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Spanish Sea .
Now if an alien creature lands on Earth — and let &apos;s call it Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe dives into a coral reef zone , space will see a lot of things .
It &apos;s not likely to dive Joe at a coral reef with a corn coral reef , full of coral , sharks , crocodiles , sea sheep , hamburgers , water turtles , etc .
So most of what Joe would see would be in this part , in the green part of the picture .
Here &apos;s the worst situation , where dead reefs and lots of microbes and jellyfish .
And where there &apos;s a diver here , the way most of the coral reefs in the world are now , with very few corals , and the algae grows faster than coral , lots of bacteria , and all the big animals have disappeared .
And that &apos;s what most research scientists saw as well .
This is the baseline for them . This is what they think is normal because we started modern science diving long after we started contaminating marine ecosystems .
So we &apos;re going to put all of us in a time machine and we &apos;re going to go to the left , we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see how the ocean was at this time .
And we &apos;re going to start with this time machine , the Al Jazeera or the tropics where we conducted a series of expeditions to National Geographic .
This sea is the archipelago of the Kiribati Republic that stretches across the equatorial line , and has many uninhabited islands , the sugar and a few are populated by the population .
So let &apos;s start with this — the island of Christmas — over 5,000 people .
Most people are dead . Most of the corals are dead , the algae feeds on them , and most of the fish are smaller in the size of the pencil that we use in their seats .
We covered 250 hours there in 2005 .
And we didn &apos;t see one monkey .
This is the place the Cuke captain discovered in 1777 , and he described that he saw a large group of sharks underpinning the roofs and the roofs of their small boats coming down to the beach .
Let &apos;s set time a little bit further in the past .
Fanging Island , 2,500 people .
Here &apos;s the case of the reef better . A lot of small fish .
And this is what many submersibles might consider to be a heaven .
This is what you see in most of the Navy National Park in Florida Kins .
And many people think that &apos;s really cool , if that &apos;s the baseline for you .
If we go back to a place like Myra Al , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the people were better and there were sharks .
You can see sharks in every diver .
And this is something very unusual compared to the corals that we normally see .
But if we move the punishment to 200 or 500 years in the past , we &apos;re going to get to places where the corals are in their entire health and meet them , made up of lovely forms and predators that are the most prolific where you see between 25 to 50 sharks in every dive .
What have we learned from those places ?
That &apos;s what we thought was normal .
This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
If we put all the fish in the coral reef and distributed them , that &apos;s what we expect to see .
Most of the biomass is made up of organisms below the food chain , grass , like sharks that eat algae .
And then the nutrients on the plankton , which are small fish , feeding on small floating animals in the water .
Then we have a smaller biomass of meat , a smaller mass of it from the top of the chain , sharks , big sharks , big hamburgers .
But that &apos;s the hurdle .
This vision of the world is the result of our study of coral reefs after contaminating them and analyzing them .
When we went to the Canadian people , we realized that the natural world had flipped upside down . The pyramid had become flipped .
Most of the biomass is from the top of the food chain , in most places , their rates are up to 85 percent of the Kingman Forest , which is now protected .
The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more to everything .
The size of those boxes is larger .
We have more sharks , more sharks , more sharks , more mass than grass fish as well , like a jungle fish , which is a sea goat .
Where the reefs clean up , everything that grows to become visible to it , the fish eat preserved on the clean reef and give the opportunity to the coral to regenerate .
It doesn &apos;t have the elegant places , it has a lot of fish , but it &apos;s also filled with the other important ingredients of the ecosystem like the giant potlins . It lows a lot of giant plastics , lakes , up to 20 , 25 to every square meter .
That &apos;s disappeared from every single area of the world &apos;s populated people , and it &apos;s a polylus filtering water , making it free of microbes and germs .
But also , there is global warming .
So the fisheries industry in those areas because it &apos;s protected by the law or because of its remote location , it would have been fantastic .
But the water is increasing for a long time and the people die .
So how can these fish and these predators help ?
Well , what we saw is that in that particular area , during one of the years of the E-Nino event between &apos; 97 and &apos; 98 , the water was warm for a very long time , and a lot of the corals had been shown and a lot of them had died .
In Christmas , where the food web has dropped so much and all the big animals have disappeared , the coral couldn &apos;t recover .
In Fanging Island , coral reefs didn &apos;t recover .
But here you see a large surface of coral that died and recovered .
And the fish have planted algae so that the algae layer is less .
And then we go to the Merra Al , which contains a mass of grass , and those corals are clean and the coral comes back .
And when you go to the clean , did you ever get this ?
These places are also white , but they &apos;re rapidly recovering .
Whenever the food network is intact and incomplete and complex , the resilience of the system , the more likely it is to recover from the disruptive effects of thermal change .
And that &apos;s good news . So we want to restore this organization .
We want to make sure that all the ingredients of the ecosystem exist so that the system can adapt to greenhouse outcomes .
So if we have to reset the baseline , if we want to reframe the ecosystem on the left , what can we do ?
Well , there are many ways .
One of those ways is very clear , which is marine reserves , especially No-Tech reserves , which we value to allow marine life to recover .
And let &apos;s go back to that picture of the Mediterranean Sea .
This was my measure . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s episodes , which look at diversity and richness and abundance .
And I thought that this rich belongs only to tropical sailing , and that the Mediterranean sea is a very poor sea of origins .
But , my knowledge remained a little bit until I first jumped into a marine reserve .
And that &apos;s what I saw , a lot of fish .
Some years ago , from five to seven years ago the fish came back and ate the wine and then the algae grew back .
So you have a small amount of algae in the size of a laptop , you can find more than 100 species of algae , most of which are measured by microscopic foot , full of small fish and plankton that in turn represent food for fish , and the system will restore its health again .
And in this particular place , the Marine Island reserve , which is just 94 haters and adds six million Euros to the local economy , 20 times as much as the fisheries enter , which is 88 percent of the tourist income .
So these protected areas , not only help the ecosystem but also those who can benefit from ecosystems .
So let me summarize what fisheries do .
For those habitats when we protect them , when we compare those habitats to non-protected areas , that &apos;s what happens .
The number of species is increasing by 21 percent . So if you have 1,000 species we expect to have 200 species more in the marine protected .
And this is a very fundamental thing .
The size of the species has increased by a third . So the fish get this big .
A lot , the number of fish in every square meter , over 170 percent .
And biomass — and this is the most glamorous variation — 4.5 times the average biomass , just after five to seven years .
And in some places it &apos;s 10 times the biomass inside the reserve .
So we have all these factors that are growing inside the reserve , so what do we do ?
Fish breed . This is a thousandth of the biology of clusters .
If fish don &apos;t kill , they live longer , they increase in size , and they breed a lot .
And the same for vertebrates . This is an example .
These are white bags put by snails outside the coast of Chile , and this is the amount of eggs I put on the bottom .
Outside the reserve , you can &apos;t even see it or distinguish it .
1.3 million eggs per square meter in the marine reserve where the number of snail animals are so many .
So these organisms breed . They form larvae and then the young people come out and spread and people can get out of them .
This is in the Bahamas , the Nasao sharks .
There &apos;s a huge number of hamburgers in the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you get .
The fisheries are getting richer .
You can see where the protected border is from the weakest boats then .
So there &apos;s a fish proliferation , so if it &apos;s earned even outside the protected border that helps people around it , and at the same time it keeps the marine environment as a whole , it gives resilience .
So what we have now , which is the world without reserves , as if it &apos;s a bank account that we pull out all the time without a deception at all .
The reserves , they &apos;re a savings account .
We have the principle of non-touch that gives social , economic and environmental return .
And if we think about the increase in biomass within the reserves , it &apos;s the same as the benefits combined , right ?
Other examples , how those reserves can work .
This is how much fishermen get every day in Kenya from fishing , over a number of years in an area without protection ; open to everyone .
And once you remove one of the most deliberate fisheries tools , which is the fishermen , the fishermen have increased .
And the less you get , the more fish you catch .
But if we add above all of this , without fishing , fishermen will continue to increase where they &apos;re hunting at a lower rate around the protected area .
Another example : Samara sharks in Biles in Central America .
This is the Mahambor mating season where they gather at the time of the Moon in December and January for a week .
They used to gather up to 30,000 fish , in this size in a single hectare in one group .
And fishermen know this , they hunt them , they exploit them .
When I first went there in 2000 , there were only 3,000 hamburgers left .
And fishermen were only offered by 30 percent of all the dead groups every year .
So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t need a rocket scientist to know this , if you take 30 percent every year , your profession is going to go very quickly .
And with the profession , the reproductive capacity of diversity is both and extinct .
And this has already happened in places around the Caribbean Sea .
And they only get out of 4,000 dollars a year of all fishing and all fishing boats .
Now , if you do an economic analysis and imagine what happens , if you take the fisheries and you just bring 20 megawatts per year , the income will double by over 20 times , which is something you can prove over time .
So how many of these reserves do we have ?
If it &apos;s that good , and if it &apos;s so easy , how protected do we have ?
You &apos;ve heard this by less than one percent of the ocean lies under protection .
And we &apos;re approaching one percent now thanks to Archimedes , and a small percentage of this is completely protected from fishing .
And scientific studies are at least 20 percent of the ocean protection .
The ratio is between 20 to 50 percent in order to achieve a series of goals for biodiversity and resilience and fish strength .
Now is this possible ? People might ask : What is the cost of a project like this ?
Well , let &apos;s think about what we &apos;re paying now in fish fisheries . 35 billion dollars a year .
And a lot of these aid goes into destructive fishing methods .
Well , there &apos;s a number of estimates to calculate what a network of protected areas can cost to cover 20 percent of the ocean , which is a tiny percentage compared to what we &apos;re paying now , and the government gives it to the mission of the fisheries .
The fishermen lose their business because of hunting .
Making a network of shops that will provide jobs directly for more than a million people , plus high school jobs , side gains .
So how can we do this ?
If it &apos;s clear that these savings accounts are useful for the environment and people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean protected ?
And how do we get there ?
Well , there are two ways to get there .
The simple solution is to create very large protected areas like archipelago Chaos .
The problem is that keeping these large reserves requires uninhabited places , where there are no social conflicts , where the political costs are low , and also the economic cost .
And a few of us , a few organizations in this room or anywhere they work on this .
But what about the rest of the world &apos;s coast , where people live and stare from fishing ?
Well , there are three main reasons why there are not tens of thousands of small shops yet . The first reason is that no one has any idea what marine protected does , and the fishermen are often very defensive when it &apos;s designed to regulate or close a space of water , no matter how small it is .
Two : their management systems are not true where most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the power to monitor resources in order to stay protected and reinforce them .
It &apos;s a pyramid system where people are waiting to be representative of the government , and that &apos;s something that &apos;s not effective , and the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
And that leads us to the third reason that there are no more protected areas is that the funding methods were wrong .
Governments and NGOs put a lot of time and energy and resources in very , very small areas .
So protecting coastal and conservation of marine life has become a condition for government or charity , and that &apos;s not constant .
So solutions come from fixing those three reasons .
First of all , we need to develop global communal campaigns to inspire local communities and governments to make better protections than the ones that currently exist .
They &apos;re savings accounts in the face of cloud accounts without deception .
Secondly , we need to redesign the management system to become distributed , uncentered , so that the burden of protecting NGOs or government bodies can be created by local communities as it happened in the Philippines and elsewhere .
And thirdly , we need to develop new business models .
Based on charity pool only to make protected is something that can &apos;t be reliable on its prove .
We really need to develop new business models where coastal protection is an investment , because as we know these marine protected provide social , environmental and economic benefits .
And I want to end with one idea , which is that there is no organization in itself that can save the ocean .
There was a lot of competition in the past . We need to develop a new model of partnership , real collaboration , where we seek integration and not replacement .
There &apos;s a lot at stake to continue as we are .
So let &apos;s do this . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you , Eric .
EH : Thank you .
CA : I &apos;ve been able to connect things together .
First , your pyramid that shows 85 percent of the biomass represented by predators looks impossible .
How does 85 percent live on just 15 percent of the fish ?
EH : Well , imagine you have an hour , one big and one small one .
The big is moving very slowly and the small is moving fast .
That &apos;s the principle .
The animals that are at the bottom of the food chain , they &apos;re breeding very quickly and growing very quickly and producing .
And over and over , we have sharks and big fish that live 25 , 30 years .
They develop very slowly , and their metabolism is slow , and basically their biomass remains as it is .
So the surplus production of these little animals down there is enough to keep that biomass that doesn &apos;t move .
It acts like the intensity of the system .
CA : That &apos;s a fascinating thing .
If we visualize the food pyramid , we have to completely change it .
EH : At least in the sea , yes .
What we found in the coral reefs is that the pyramid is the equivalent of the Singapore system , but there are five lions per animal in the wild .
And on land it doesn &apos;t work .
But at least it works with coral systems where the infrastructure in the pyramid has this structure .
We think it &apos;s a global public base .
But we started studying the early people very recently .
CA : So the numbers I gave are really amazing .
You say we spend 35 billion dollars now on aid .
Whereas we only need 16 billion to make 20 percent of the ocean protected marine areas that give new life-saving choices .
If the world is smarter to solve this problem , it &apos;s 19 billion dollars .
We &apos;ll have 19 billion dollars to spend on health care or something .
EH : And then we have the returns of the fisheries mission , so we have 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the key solutions is to make the World Trade Organization move those aid into sustainable practices .
CA : I &apos;ve heard a lot of examples outside of how this aid crazy ended .
So thank you for those numbers .
The last question is a personal question .
A lot of the experiences of sitting here who were in the ocean for a long time were seeing these refrigerated places , the ones that they saw once beautiful got worse , something frustrated .
He told me about the feeling that I had to experience when I went to these rural areas and saw the return to the better .
EH : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We go there trying to understand ecosystems , trying to measure fish and sharks to see how different these places are from the ones we know .
But the best thing I felt was that this vital intimacy that Edward Wilson talks about , where humans have a sense of wonder and glamour and the uncomfortable nature .
And there , just there you really feel that you &apos;re just part of something that &apos;s the largest part of a global ecosystem .
And for those places that give me hope , I wouldn &apos;t continue to follow this work .
It would have become something very frustrating .
CA : Well , Eric , thank you for sharing us in part of that spiritual experience . Thank you .
EH : Thank you very much .
In 1995 , I was still in college , and my friend and I decided to go on a journey across the country with a car from Rody Island or Portland in Oregon .
We were both young and passionate about working , and we decided to start doing this through sub-routes across national parks and local forests , the plan was to take the longest possible path .
And in the middle of the road in Dakota , I looked at my girlfriend and asked her what was going on with me for the next 2,000 miles .
I asked , &quot; What &apos;s the story of this Chinese letter that I saw all the way ? &quot;
I looked at my girlfriend , very peculiar .
There &apos;s a man sitting in front of me now looking at the same view .
( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; This is all these paintings that show up every flavor , on the Chinese letter . &quot; &quot; I looked at me for a second , and I looked at laughter because she figured out what I was wondering .
I was wondering about this sign .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the famous Chinese character that expresses the regions of the park . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the past five years of my life thinking about these kinds of situations that are very similar when we get it wrong , all of these signals around us , and how we act when we discover that we &apos;re wrong about it , and that tells us about our nature as human beings .
In other words , as you &apos;ve heard before , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about when one gets wrong .
Maybe that &apos;s a little shocking . I mean , this specialization , but in fact it &apos;s a special specialization , because nobody &apos;s competing with it .
( Laughter ) In fact , all of us are doing everything and trying to avoid admitting his mistakes or at least thinking that he might be wrong .
We get overwhelmed , and we forget that we &apos;re wrong .
In fact , everybody in this room makes mistakes .
In fact , humans are at risk of error .
But when it comes to me today , all of the beliefs that I believe in — now in this case , the response to self-evaluation , in being susceptible , scattered away , and I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;m wrong with .
And the problem with this is that we &apos;re in a situation right now , where we live .
We bring in meetings . &quot; &quot; Now , the moment is , &quot; &quot; We go out into family trips in the state of &quot; &quot; now , the moment &quot; &quot; we vote , and we express our opinions in the case of &quot; &quot; now , the moment .
It &apos;s an effective way to go forward in this life and to hold ourselves in this bubble that surrounds us , which is our sense that we &apos;re all right .
I think that &apos;s a big problem .
It &apos;s a huge problem for us both individually and individually and practical and social , and I think this problem is a cumulative thing to our culture .
What I want to do today is to start talking to you about our closet in a bubble , our inner sense that we &apos;re right .
And secondly , it wasn &apos;t so bad .
And then I &apos;m going to convince you that it &apos;s possible to get out of this bubble , and if you do that , it &apos;s going to be the greatest moral , creative act that you can do in this life .
So , why do we get stuck in that bubble , the bubble of our permanent sense that we &apos;re right ?
One of the most important reasons is the feeling of being wrong .
Let me ask people a question : No , let me ask people here , they &apos;re closer to how you feel when you &apos;re wrong .
March , depressed .
IM : All right . Excellent .
March , depressed , embarrassed , thank you . That &apos;s the right answer , but that &apos;s the answer to another question .
You answer the question , what do you feel when you realize you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) I think you &apos;re wrong makes you feel all that , right ?
I mean , it might be devastating , but it might be inspiring , and it could be funny as my situation when I realized my mistake about the Chinese letter .
But being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like this .
Let me explain to you , how is the truth about being wrong ?
Do you remember the Lonny Town cartoon when the cat rat appears , and he &apos;s chasing the enemy , and he doesn &apos;t hold it at all ?
In every episode that happens , there &apos;s a moment when the fly is catching the bird , and the bird gets off the shelf , and that &apos;s normal , because the bird can fly .
But the problem is that the fly is reversing through the shelf .
And that &apos;s funny , if you &apos;re six years old , and the fly doesn &apos;t have a problem with it .
And he keeps going back to that moment he looks down his feet and realizes he &apos;s in the air burning .
And then a balloon fall .
When we &apos;re wrong , we don &apos;t realize it , I mean , before we realize it , we &apos;re like this rat during the rooms , until we look down at it .
The situation is , we &apos;re really wrong , and we &apos;re in trouble , but unfortunately we feel like we &apos;re standing on solid land .
So I have to correct what I said before .
What we feel when we &apos;re wrong is that we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s one of the reasons why , well , why do we get stuck in our sense that we &apos;re right ?
I call this the &quot; &quot; blindness &quot; &quot; case .
We often don &apos;t have any internal evidence that we &apos;re completely wrong about something , so that time is too late to fix it .
But there &apos;s also another reason why we get stuck in this sense of being right , and the reason for that is because of culture .
Let me take you back to primary school .
Remember when you sit in the class , and when the teacher returns you the papers , one of the papers of the students looks like this .
By the way , this is not my card .
( Laughter ) Well , you &apos;re in school , and I know exactly what &apos;s going on in your room right now about the student with this piece of paper .
It &apos;s the stupid kid , the problem maker , who doesn &apos;t do it at all .
At the age of nine , we learn and accept that the people who make mistakes are the classic , the non-responsibility , and also , furthermore , we accept that the way to succeed in life should be defined by mistakes .
And we &apos;re learning these false lessons very convincing .
And many of us , especially those of us in this room , deal with success in life as a parallel concept of students who are completely over-performed , much more accomplished .
Isn &apos;t that true ? Mr. Minister of Mali , the astrophysicist , the modern-day column ?
( Laughter ) Yeah , you &apos;re all like this , managers , mathematicians .
Well , that &apos;s great .
But the problem is , we get rid of the idea that we &apos;re wrong .
Because , according to what &apos;s wrong , it means that there is something wrong with us as individuals .
So we always insist that we are always right , because this insight makes us feel smart and responsible and safe .
Let me tell you a story .
Two years ago , a woman walked into the center of the Elizabeth Israel operation .
Beth Israel is located in Boston .
It &apos;s a training center at Harvard , which is one of the best hospitals in the United States .
And this woman entered the operating room .
They were chosen , and then they had a procedure , and they returned to their room for the candle .
And everything seemed to have worked pretty well .
And when I woke up , I looked at herself and I wondered , why is the other end of my body frozen ? Why is the other end of my body numb ? In fact , the surgeon had done a very large surgery on the left side rather than the right side of the body ?
And when the Minister of Health and Medicine talked about what happened in Peth Israel , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; For some reason , the surgeon felt he was practicing his work on the other end of the surgery . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is the axis of my talk , and the confidence is absolutely determined that you &apos;re on the right of something that might be very dangerous .
The intrinsic feeling that we are right and that we feel is not a reliable reference to what &apos;s happening in the outside world around us .
And when we act like this , in this internal motivation , it &apos;s not going to be the complaint that we &apos;re going to make a mistake about reference , it &apos;s going to end up spending 200 million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or we &apos;re going to hit the world with an economic crisis .
That &apos;s really dangerous .
It &apos;s a big , social problem .
Imagine for a moment what that feels like when you &apos;re right about something .
It means that all your beliefs are ideal and reflect reality .
And when you feel that way and you have a problem or you make a decision , how do you explain your meaning to the people around you who see you &apos;re completely wrong ?
Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , it turns out that we all justify that in the same way by making a number of assumptions .
The first is that when someone shows something we did , we assume , first of all , they &apos;re ignorant .
They don &apos;t have the same information that we have about it , and if we present all the information that we have in every honor , they don &apos;t need to understand our choice and turn into our classroom .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , we see that these people have experienced the information that we have , and they &apos;re still opposed to what we do , we move to the second assumption , which is that they &apos;re not stupid .
( Laughter ) Because they understand all the characters of the story and they can &apos;t gather them together to understand what we understand .
And when that doesn &apos;t work , when we see that the people who make our decisions have all the facts , and they &apos;re more conscious than we are moving to the third assumption , we assume that they know the truth , but they &apos;re using their flat for the reasons of the British and the self-interest .
This is completely devastating .
This commitment to the right of our choices keeps us from acknowledging our mistakes more often needed , and it pushes us to treat each other bad .
But for me , the worst of all of this and the most inspiring is that we lose the fundamental meaning of being human .
It &apos;s as if we want to imagine that our brains are just transparent windows , and we can go out and half the world as it is through this framework .
And we want everybody to do it both and see things from the same angle that we see .
That &apos;s a big mistake , and if life really is , you see it from one window , it &apos;s very boring .
The bone of the brain is that it doesn &apos;t see the world as it is .
He sees it in another picture .
We can remember the past and think about the future , and we can imagine ourselves in other people &apos;s locations .
And we do all of this simply , and that &apos;s what makes us all look at the same sky , some of us see the stars and the other one , the moon and the other darkness .
And that &apos;s what makes us see things wrong .
1200 years ago , Dicquart said , &quot; &quot; I think if I exist . &quot; &quot; And then the dictionary Augustine came and wrote , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong , if I exist , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong if I exist . &quot;
St. August understood that our ability to make mistakes is not embarrassing , but in human psychology is something that makes us go beyond mistakes when we discover them and rebuild ourselves .
It &apos;s crucial to our human existence .
Because as humans , unlike God , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s really going on .
And we as humans are very special about the rest of the species , our obsession with knowing everything .
For me , this obsession is the foundation for all production and creativity .
Last year , for several reasons , I sat down to listen to a lot of loops of popular radio show , &quot; This is American life . &quot;
And as I listened to all those rings , I suddenly started to feel like those rings were wrong .
And it occurred to me immediately that I had lost my mind .
I became the misconductor .
And I see mistakes everywhere , which is what happened later .
But two months after that , I had an opportunity to have a conversation with ER Glass , the host of the program .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re right .
In fact , our staff and what they have in common is that all the rings have the same trend .
And the general trend is , &quot; &quot; I thought things were going on in some way , and it goes in a completely different direction . &quot; &quot; And then ER Glass said , &quot; &quot; We need these moments .
What we find is that we &apos;re wrong , we need this trauma and surprise and a sense of mistake for our lives to go right , and for us , as viewers , as listeners , as readers , we stand up with these stories with a lot of significance .
We love the stories of surprising findings , we are stories of completely changing plans .
And believe me when it comes to us , we would love to be wrong .
Our stories are beautiful , because our lives are .
We always expect something to happen , and something else happens .
George Bush predicted that if Iraq occupied , he would discover the weapons of mass destruction and free people and spread democracy in the Middle East .
But what happened was something completely different .
And Mubarak made me realize that he was going to stay the president of Egypt until he was about to become completely ill and so important , and I think we can move power to his son .
But what happened was something completely different .
And maybe you think you &apos;re going to grow up , and you &apos;re going to marry your girlfriend from high school , and then go back to your original city and raise the kids together .
But what happened was something completely different .
And I have to tell you , I thought I would write a bad book , and everyone would hate it , and people would not understand it .
But something quite opposite happened .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
It carries happiness and recovery , and we write stories about the world around us , and then the world wears on us and surprised us .
I don &apos;t mean anything , but this conference , this horrible gathering , is simply to make a mistake .
We spend a whole week talking about inventions and advances and discoveries , but you know , we didn &apos;t need all those achievements and discoveries .
Because half of the things that were shown at TED in 1998 , which was very glamorous and really wonderful , huh !
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t work at all . ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my jet bag , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Here we are again .
We bring the ball back .
And we come up with new ideas .
We tell new stories .
And we have a new conference .
And the title of this conference , as you &apos;ve heard this week , is rediscovering creativity .
And for me , if you want to rediscover creativity , you have to come out of your circle and from your bubble that you &apos;re always right , try to listen to other people around you and look at the bones and the complexity of the universe around you and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not sure .
Maybe I &apos;ve got it wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
On November 5th , 1990 , a man named Mr. Sener entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi Kahn , the leader of the Jewish defense system .
Basically , a victory was convicted of murder , but when he was spending a prison on violent issues , he was planning with other men to attack dozens of sites in New York City , including tunnels and Jewish temples and the headquarters of the United Nations .
Fortunately , these manuscripts were frustrated by a federal investigation agent .
Unfortunately it exploded in 1993 for the World Trade Center didn &apos;t land .
Eventually half was convicted to be involved in the process .
Mr. Sener is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , in Pennsylvania in 1983 , an Egyptian engineer , and from a loving American mother , she was a teacher in the initial class , and they worked together everything in their happiness to make me live a happy childhood .
At the age of seven , our family &apos;s dynamic started to change .
When my father showed me on the side of Islam a few people , including the majority of Muslims , they wouldn &apos;t see him .
My own experience says that when people take their time to connect with each other , it doesn &apos;t take too much to realize that in all , we all yearn for the same things in life .
However , in every religion , in every society , you will find a few people who are so excited about their beliefs that they feel that they have to use all the necessary means to carry others to live as they do .
A few months before he was arrested , he sat down and explained to me that during the weekend , some of his friends were going to the Long Island Protection exercise in order to practice goals .
And he told me I would agree with him the next morning .
We got to the Calmon Development , which was , without knowing from our group , observing by the FBI .
When my role came to shoot , my father helped me hold the gun on my shoulder and explained to me how I had to target the target 30 yards away .
That day , I had the last bullet that little orange light that was on the target and what was surprising to everybody , especially to me , the whole goal had exploded .
My uncle turned to the rest of the men , and he said to Arabic , &quot; &quot; My father &apos;s son . &quot; &quot; That scar of that lion .
And apparently they exploded parties on this comment , but it took a few years to understand exactly what they thought was funny .
They thought they saw me the same destruction that my father was able to do .
These men were eventually convicted of putting a small truck with 1500 pounds of explosions on the ground to stop cars tracking the North Tower to the World Trade Center , causing explosions that led to killing six people and more than 1,000 others .
These guys were my strength .
These were people I call &quot; &quot; spontaneous , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; uncle &quot; &quot; .
When I was 19 , I had moved 20 times in my life , not stabilizing that during my childhood , it didn &apos;t really give me a chance to identify more friends .
Every time I start feeling comfortable for someone , that &apos;s the period that we have to collect our bag to move to the next city .
And because I was always the new student in the section , I was often vulnerable to the guests .
I was afraid of my colleagues in the classroom to avoid my targeting , but it turned out that , being the new quiet boy and the new toxin in in the section was a good , ridiculous warning .
So often , I would spend my day at home looking at books and watching TV or playing video games .
And for those reasons , I was lack of social skills , at least , and growing up in a disturbing home , I couldn &apos;t get ready to face the real world .
I grew up controlling people based on peer-to-peer standards , like race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiments that challenged my thinking was during the presidential election of the year 2000 .
During my preparation program at university , I was a member of the National Council of Youth in Philadelphia .
The focus of my own group of young violence , and being the victim of antibiotics most of my life , this was a topic that I was particularly excited about .
The members of the group were different walks of life .
One day , at the end of the council , I discovered that one of the kids I had encountered was Jewish .
Now , it took me several days to show these details on the surface , and I realized that there was no natural enemy between us and the two .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt proud that I could get past a hurdle that I had been dreamed for my entire life to believe that it was impossible to overcome .
A major transformation point happened when I found a summer job in Bush Gardens , a luxury garden .
There , I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures , and it turns out that that experience was fundamental in the evolution of my personality .
For most of my life , I &apos;ve been told that homosexuality is a guilt , and therefore , all gay people have a negative impact .
And I happened , I had the opportunity to work with gay actors in a show there , and then I soon discovered that some of them were the nicest , and the least judged people .
Being exposed to the guests when I was a kid who created a kind of empathy with other people &apos;s suffering , and it seems to me unusual to treat nice people in any other way that I would like to deal with .
And because of that feeling , I was able to compare the stereotypes I received when I was a child with the real life experience and deal with people .
I don &apos;t know what it means to be gay , but I know very well what it means to be judged about something outside of my will .
Then came the program &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; So John Stewart was telling me , every night I had to be honest with myself about my disability and helped me realize that it had nothing to do with sweating or religion or sexuality in the quality of his character .
It was sometimes a father &apos;s character for me when I was desperately needing father .
The inspiration can come from an unexpected place , and being a Jewish comedian has done a lot to affect my vision of the world more than my extreme father did , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a loss to me .
One day , I was talking to my mother about my view of the world began to change , and she told me something that I would always carry in my heart as long as I lived .
I looked at two very tired eyes carrying them out of the jungle enough in his life , and she said , &quot; I &apos;ve been tired of hate people . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy it takes to carry that hatred inside you .
Zack Ibrahim is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to cut her story with my parents and start a new life .
So why do I go out and put myself in a potentially dangerous situation ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I do this in the hopes that maybe one day has to be forced to use violence that might listen to my story and realize that there &apos;s a better way , that if you &apos;re vulnerable to that violence , and ideology isn &apos;t tolerant , it hasn &apos;t become tired .
Instead , I chose to use my experience to fight against terrorism , against prejudice .
I do this for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , pain and pain and pain that terrorism forced them to live .
For victims of terrorism , I &apos;m going to speak loudly against these blueprints and the religion of what my father did .
Simply , I stand here as evidence that violence is not originally in religion or race of one , and that the son doesn &apos;t have to follow his father &apos;s fault .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , all of you . ( Applause ) Thank you , all of you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
I &apos;m glad to be here .
And you have your support and thank you .
And I really want to talk about things that interest me , but unfortunately , I doubt that what interests me is not going to interest others .
First , my card says I &apos;m an astronomer .
How much I want to talk about my astronomical research , but I doubt that the number of people who care about radioactive transmission in the gray atmosphere and the polarization of light in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter is the number of people who are standing in the bus waiting station .
I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s also interesting to talk about what happened in 1986 and 1987 , when Hacker hacked our systems in Lawrence Berkeley labs .
And I captured them and it turned out that they were working on what the Soviet intelligence was , CG , stealing information and selling it .
I &apos;d like to talk about that — and that would be fun — but , 20 years later ...
I find computer security , frankly , boring .
It &apos;s very daunting .
I — when you do something for the first time , you do science .
The second time , it turns into engineering .
The third time , you &apos;re just my art .
I &apos;m a scientist . And when I &apos;m done with something , I move to something else .
I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
And I &apos;m not going to talk about saying , I see it &apos;s obvious , from my first book , &quot; &quot; The Sliki Farm , &quot; &quot; and not my second book , and I &apos;m not going to talk about why I believe computers can &apos;t be in schools .
I feel that there &apos;s a tremendous and strange opinion that we have to put more computers in schools .
My idea is : No ! No !
They took them out of schools and kept them out .
I &apos;d like to talk about this , but I see that the argument is clear for everyone who has spent a long time in the initial fourth grade so much that it doesn &apos;t need more talk — but , it seems to be very wrong with that , and everything I said .
So , don &apos;t go back to my Ph.D. to read it .
Maybe it &apos;s full of lies as well .
And after all , I got my word five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And when you look here , the basic point I wrote on my thumb is the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , right ?
Oh , OK . And my feeling is that it &apos;s strange to ask me to talk about the future , because my hair is full of young , and so , it &apos;s ridiculous to talk about the future .
In fact , I see that if you really want to know what &apos;s going to happen in the future , if you really want to know the future , don &apos;t ask a rating , a scientist , a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask someone who writes pioneers .
No , if you want to know the state of society 20 years later , ask a nursery teacher .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask any teacher in a bar , ask an expertise teacher .
They know what society will be like in a generation .
I don &apos;t know . And so , in my opinion , other people who talk about the future , they don &apos;t know .
Of course , we can all imagine these beautiful new things that will exist in the future .
But for me , things are not the future .
The question I ask myself , what would the community be like , and our kids today are incredibly good at texting and spend a lot of time in front of the screen , but they &apos;ve never been to play the bowling sport together .
The change is happening , and this change that &apos;s happening is not the change in software .
But , that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I want to talk about it , it &apos;s going to be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
Oh — the other thing I want to talk about is it &apos;s here . Here .
Is this visible ? I want to talk about one-dimensional things .
How many things I want to talk about are just one dimension .
Because I love Mobius tapes , and I don &apos;t just like them , but I &apos;m one of the few , if I &apos;m not the only one in the world , who make Clean bottles .
Very quickly , I hope your eyes will be staring here .
This is Klein &apos;s bottle .
For those of you who know it from the audience , you might flip your eyes and say , yes . We know everything about it .
It &apos;s one takeoff . &quot; &quot; Inside this bottle is itself external .
Their size is zero . It &apos;s not directive .
This imperative has amazing properties .
If you take the Mobius slice and you mix them together , you get one of these boats , and I make them out of glass .
I &apos;d like to talk about these dictionaries , but I don &apos;t have a lot to say about them because — ( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I &apos;m cold , though , the letter D at TED is the first letter of the word &quot; Design Design in English .
And two weeks ago I made — you know ? I was making Clain bottles with small , medium sizes , and an expert .
But what I did for Ti — and I &apos;m happy to show you , for the first time in public here .
This is two special bottles of wine , and they recognize , even though they &apos;re in the four-dimensional world that are not supposed to carry fluid at all , and they &apos;re able to do that because the universe in which we live only has three dimensions of possibility .
And because this universe only has three dimensions of possibility , so it can carry liquid .
So it &apos;s very — this is the best one .
This bottle represents months of my life .
But even though I want to talk about topology with you , I won &apos;t .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to talk to you about my mother , who died last summer .
She collected pictures of me , as all mothers do .
Can anyone lift this ?
And I looked at her album and she had put a picture of me , standing — or sitting , in 1969 , in front of a set of keys .
And I looked at her , and I said , oh my God , that &apos;s me when I was working at the electronic music studio !
I was an artist , doing reform and maintenance in the cyber studio at Sandy University in Pavulo . And boy to the unknown .
The distant past machine . And I thought to myself , yeah !
And it brought me back .
After that , I found another picture that my mother kept , a picture of me .
This guy here is me , of course .
And the guy is Robert Motcher , the inventor of Senator , who died last August .
Robert was a good , good human being , and a very rare engineer .
And a musician donates his time to teach me , a second year student , the first , at the University of Sandy in Pavulo .
He would come from Troomborg to teach me and not just about a candle , but we would sit there — and I would study physics then . 1969 , 70 , 71 .
And we study physics , I study physics , and he says , &quot; &quot; What do you do good .
You don &apos;t sink in the Economic music if you study physics . &quot; &quot; It was a role model for me . He would come and spend hours and hours with me .
And he also wrote a recommendation message for me to go to graduate school .
In the back of the picture , my bike .
It turns out this picture is taken in my friend &apos;s house .
We had Bob Mott and he had a pile of devices to show us , Jersey Flintet , things about it .
We sat down talking about instant transformations , tuberculosis , infectious transit function , things like that .
Bob &apos;s death last summer was a loss of all of us .
Burt Mozambique influenced everyone who has music .
( Applause ) And I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do now . What I &apos;m going to do now — I hope you &apos;ve recognized the pocket curved , an almost triangular wave on this occuloscope from Helve-Packard .
Fantastic , I can get there , right ?
Children . Children are the topic I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
I wrote &quot; &quot; Children &quot; &quot; here , they &apos;re the ones I want to talk about .
I decided , for me at least , my head is not big enough .
So I think locally and I act locally as well .
I feel the best way to help anything is to help very local .
After a Ph.D. in this , a testimony there , and so on .
I was talking about these things to some of the professors in schools a year ago .
And one of them , they come to me and they say , &quot; So , why don &apos;t you teach ? &quot;
And I said to them , &quot; &quot; In the syringe , I study in the actual studies — I had graduate students , and I also studied students in the Calagos . &quot; &quot; No , they told me , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re interested in children and their heads , why aren &apos;t you here in the front lines ?
You translate your minds with your actions . &quot; &quot; Really . I study science for the eighth grade four times a week .
I don &apos;t visit them all the time .
No , no , no , no , no . I take the absence .
I &apos;m a lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , I &apos;m not saying that to clap to me .
I strongly suggest that it &apos;s good to do it for all of you .
It &apos;s not just visitors all the time and time .
Do a whole week of teaching . Well , I study three quarters of the time , but it &apos;s still good enough .
One of the things I did to students of science is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;ll teach you physics at the university level .
Without calculus , I got rid of that .
You don &apos;t need to know how to calculate triangles .
But you need to know the eighth grade material , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
I don &apos;t want to teach from &quot; &quot; Open the seventh chapter and solve all the issues with the individual numbers . &quot;
We &apos;re going to do solid physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do now .
( Serious sound ) Oh , before I run this device , one of the things we did three weeks ago in my expedition — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used lens is measuring the speed of light .
Students at Al Crito — with my help , of course , with the help of a very old Oscar , measured the speed of light .
It was less than 25 percent actual value . How many eighth grade students do you know who measured the speed of light ?
In addition , we measured the speed of sound as well .
And I &apos;d like to measure the speed of light here .
And I was ready to do that , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Man , &quot; &quot; I was going to impose myself to power people , and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m still determined by that . I &apos;m still determined by that , but apparently the focus of that here , we &apos;re going to need 10 minutes to prepare .
We don &apos;t have time to do that .
So next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
But , until then , we &apos;re going to calculate the speed of sound !
The obvious way to calculate the speed of sound is to make sound bounce from something and then look for reverberation .
But , perhaps — one of my students , named Ariel , said , &quot; Can we calculate the speed of light using a wavelength equation ? &quot;
And you all know that the wavelength equation is : frequency hits the wavelength of any wave ...
It &apos;s a constant number . When the frequency goes up , the length of the wave goes up , the frequency goes down . So , when we have a wave here — here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — the more the sound goes up , the more things get closer together , when the sound goes down , things go up .
Right ? This is one of the fundamental physics .
You all know that from eighth grade , right ?
What they didn &apos;t say to you in physics — in the physics course of the eighth grade — and what they had to say to you — and how much I wish they did — is that when you hit the frequency of the sound wave or the light , you get a constant number .
And that constant number is the speed of sound .
So , to be able to measure the speed of sound , all I have to do is figure out what you want . Okay , that &apos;s easy .
I have the frequency computer here .
Let &apos;s hit it AA . Here it is , almost .
Now , we know the frequency .
The frequency is 1.76 kilometers . I &apos;m going to count the length of the wave .
Now all I have to do is move to another radiation , and the bottom radiation represents my voice and I &apos;m talking , right ?
So , whenever you talk , you &apos;ll see this on the screen .
I &apos;m going to put this here , and as I &apos;m going to start with the source , you &apos;ll notice the helix .
Icelandic movements . We &apos;re moving between different peaks of the wave , coming out of here .
The physicists of you , I hear you flip your eyes , hold me a little bit . ( Laughter ) To measure the length of the wave , all I have to do is measure the distance from here , an entire wave , to here .
From here to here is the length of the sound wave .
So , I &apos;m going to put the measurement tape here , the measurement tape here , move it backwards here .
I moved the phone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back here , 20 cents .
Well , let &apos;s go back to Ms. Emo .
And we would say that the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelength is 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s come up with an answer .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 x 0.2 = 352 meters per second .
If you look for this value in a book , it &apos;s 343 .
But using these weak materials , and this bad drinking — we can measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Very good .
All of this leads to what I want to say .
Back to my image that goes back to a million years in the past .
In 1971 , at the time of the Vietnam War , he screamed , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I study physics : &quot; &quot; Lando , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Libeschitz , &quot; &quot; Reznik , and &quot; &quot; Jewish &quot; &quot; book .
As I went home after a test , there was a violent phenomenon in campus .
A violent phenomenon ! Emo is over . Close .
There &apos;s a violent phenomenon in the campus , and the police get me , okay ?
I walk through the campus . A police comes up and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student ! &quot;
He comes out with his gun . He fires !
And a marble gas box the size of a baseball box passing by my head . Woosh !
I breathe the tear gas and then I can &apos;t breathe .
He &apos;s got a police and he &apos;s got a gun .
He wants to beat her on my head !
I said to myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get out of here ! &quot; &quot; I ran across the campus as far as I could . Delhi was in the Higgs building .
He &apos;s one of the building bridges .
The police run behind me .
It &apos;s being backwards on the first floor , second , third .
I get into one of the rooms .
A room that leads to the bell tower .
I close the door behind me , and I &apos;m up , walking through the place where the pendulum moves .
And I think , yes , the root of the pendulum fits with its role . ( Laughter ) I keep going up , backwards .
I go to a place where the static column divides on a wall .
There &apos;s an hour , an hour , an hour .
Time is running backwards because I &apos;m inside the clock .
I think of the Pornis and the Athenian proportion .
I keep going up , and there &apos;s a place , in the back , you have to climb a wooden ladder to get there .
I open up my door , and there &apos;s a puncture .
A pillar , 10 feet long .
I look out and I see the police hitting the students on their heads , releasing the tear gas of the tears , and I see the students throwing the stamp on them .
And I wonder , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; And then I remembered what the English professor told me in high school .
When they get dust in the mold , they write a cow on it .
So , I scan the toilets from one of the bricks , and I look at it .
I still wonder , why am I here ? So , I &apos;d like to tell you the spoken words on the Higgs Build : &quot; &quot; The truth is one .
Under this light , science and religion are perhaps sampling together towards the scaling evolution of humanity , from the darkness to light , from the horizon to its capacity , from being exposed to tolerance .
It &apos;s the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
A few years ago , I broke my house .
I led to my house , and it was the middle of the night , in Montreal winter , I was visiting to my friend Jeff living on the other side . It was the temperature measurement on the front porch pointing to 40 below zero — and not disturbing yourself and trying to know if 40 degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit , 40 degrees below zero that same thing — it was very cold .
And as I stood on the front porch , I was feeling my pocket searching , and I discovered my keys were not with me .
In fact , I can see it through the window , on the dining room table where I left them .
So I rush up and I tried to open all the doors and windows , and they were all massively accepted .
I thought I &apos;d ask for help from the bomb maker , at least my mobile phone with me , but in the middle of the night it could take some time , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house to spend the night because I was going on a tomorrow morning flight to Europe and I needed my passport and my backpack .
So I was desperate and I felt frozen out of the cold , I found a big rock and I used it to break the basement window , I pulled off the broken glass and crawled through it and found a piece of cardboard and used it to cover the hole , and I decided that in the morning , on my way to the airport , I could call the cradle and ask him to fix the window .
It would be expensive , but maybe it would be less than the bomb makers in the middle of the night , so I think under these circumstances , that I was going to do that .
I &apos;m a trained neuroscientist , and I know a little bit about how the brain works under pressure .
He releases the carrot hormone that causes the heart rate , and he regulates the adrenaline levels , and he confuses you .
So the next morning when I woke up from the few hours I had worried about the gap in the window that I had to call the institution and worry about the low temperatures , and also the meetings I had in Europe , and , you know , with all of this bag of chlorol in my mind , I didn &apos;t know that I was also walking around .
( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport registry office , I realized that I forgot to get my passport . ( Laughter )
So I ran a speed home in this snow and cold , and it took 40 minutes to bring it back to the airport , and it got at the right time , but they gave my seat to another person , so I stuck in the back of the plane near the water cycle in a seat that doesn &apos;t bend up on a journey that takes eight hours .
Well , I have a long time in the &apos; 80s to think about it without sleeping .
( Laughter ) And I started to wonder , are there things that I could do that arrangements should be put in place that could prevent bad things happening ?
Or at least if bad things happen , they will reduce the likelihood of becoming completely disastrous .
So I started thinking about that , but my ideas didn &apos;t quite cross until about a month later .
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny Kanman , the Nobel Prize winner , and I told him that I was kind of embarrassed about the story of fractal glass , and , you know , forgotten the passport , and Danny told me that he was practicing something called the expected perceptions .
( Laughter ) It was something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Clain who had been writing about a few years ago , which is also called pre-death .
You all know what it means after death .
When a disaster happens , a team of experts come in and try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
Well , at some point before death , Danny explained that you &apos;re looking at what &apos;s in front of you and trying to figure out what &apos;s wrong and then you &apos;re trying to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or reduce their damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today is some of the things we can do at some point before the event .
Some of them are clear , some of them are not quite clear .
I &apos;m going to start with that clarity .
All over the house , pick up places for things that are easily lost .
This makes sense , but there &apos;s a lot of science to support this hypothesis based on how our spatial memory works .
In the brain , there &apos;s an area known as hippocampus that has evolved over tens of thousands of years to track the sites of important things , where are the beavers , and where can we find the fish and where the tribes live and where the tribes live .
The hippocampus is part of the brain that the taxi drivers have in London .
It &apos;s the part that allows the inmates to have a winning .
And if you &apos;re wondering , someone actually did an experiment where they disrupted the sense of smell in the squirrels and allowed them to find a winning .
They were not dependent on the sense of smell , but they were using the horse , and this mechanism developed beautifully to find things .
But it &apos;s effective for things that don &apos;t move very much , don &apos;t work for things that move around here and there .
That &apos;s why you lose the keys of the car and the speeches of reading and travel gates .
So at home you have to determine a place for your trainer — install a kidnapper on the door , or maybe a fake song .
And it &apos;s a special lesson for the passport .
And a particular table to put your reading glasses on it .
If you determine a place , and you &apos;re accurate about it , you find things that are in place when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Take a picture of your cell phone , your credit card , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , send it to your email in the cloud .
If you lose these things or stolen from you , you can replace them easily .
This is some of the intuitions .
Remember , when you &apos;re under pressure , the brain releases the carrot hormone .
Cortisol is toxic , and it causes the noise of thinking .
So part of the pre-action is to realize that you &apos;re under pressure , you &apos;re not going to be in your best case , and you have to put the arrangements in place .
And there &apos;s no situation that causes more anxiety than you face for medical decisions that you have to take .
And at some point , each of us will be exposed to such situations where we have to make very important decisions about the future medical care or the ones we love to help them make a decision .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very special medical situation .
But this seems like a documentation of all medical decision-making cases and actually making financial decisions and social decisions — what kind of decisions you have to make that can benefit from rational evaluation of facts .
Suppose you went to the doctor , and he said , &quot; You &apos;ve got the analysis results , and it shows a rise in cholesterol . &quot;
We all know that high blood cholesterol is associated with increasing risk of exposure to heart disease and blood vessels , the heart attack of stroke .
So you think the high cholesterol rate is not a good thing , and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to describe to you a drug that will help you reduce the level of cholesterol , which is the &apos; 60s . &quot; &quot; And you may have heard about the &apos; 60s , you know , it &apos;s one of the most expensive drugs that are being used in the world today , and you may know people taking it .
And you start thinking , &quot; &quot; Yes ! Give me Stein . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this statistical point that you should be asking that most doctors avoid talking about and pharmaceutical companies avoid talking about a lot .
It &apos;s the number to be treated .
Now what do we mean by that ?
It &apos;s the number of people who need a drug or a surgery or any medical procedure before one person &apos;s help .
You &apos;re going to ask what these crazy statistics are .
It has to be one outcome .
The doctor won &apos;t describe any medication if it &apos;s not useful to me .
But in fact , medical practice doesn &apos;t follow this way .
That &apos;s not a doctor &apos;s error , if it &apos;s somebody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s going to be the wrong scientists like me .
We didn &apos;t discover the basic mechanisms enough .
But Glass Smith Clain estimates that 90 percent of the drugs have 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number that you need to treat with the Staten is widely described how much do you think it should be ?
How many people do they have to take before helping one person ?
300 people .
This is according to the research done by researchers , Jeremy Grubber and Bamila Hartzald , and he proved the Bloomber.com autonomously .
I made sure of these numbers myself .
300 people had to take drugs for a year before we had a heart attack or a stroke or a bad effect .
And maybe now you &apos;re going to start thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , a chance of 300 to lower my cholesterol level .
And why not , Dr. ? Do a chocolate anyway , but at this point you have to ask other statistics , which is , &quot; &quot; Talk me about side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
For this drug , it shows the side effects on five percent of the patients .
It includes terrible things , and they infect muscles and pain in the joints and pain in the digestive system , but you get this idea , &quot; &quot; Five percent , it &apos;s not likely to happen to me , though I &apos;m going to take the medicine . &quot; &quot; But wait a minute .
Remember that under pressure you can &apos;t think clearly .
So you have to think about this already , you don &apos;t have to get into a series of ideas immediately .
It takes 300 people a drug , right ? One person has been helped with five percent of the side effects , that &apos;s about 15 people .
You &apos;re more likely to hurt for about 15 times than to get help from it .
I &apos;m not saying you should take the 60 or not .
I mean , you have to have this conversation with your doctor .
Medicine morality imposes that it &apos;s part of the principle of approval about science .
You have the right to get this kind of information to have a conversation about whether you want to leave it or not .
You might think I &apos;ve come up with this number of vocalizations of your brain , but it &apos;s actually quite typical , where this number needs treatment .
For surgical procedures that were conducted on a broad disorder of men who were 50 years old , who got prostate because of cancer was the number that needed treatment 49 .
That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries were done on everyone who was helped .
The side effects in this case showed up to 50 percent of the patients .
The sexual deficit includes the weakness , the lesion , the urine goes down , and he screws straight , and the fecal goes down .
And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has this , they will survive for a year or more .
So the idea before the event is to think already about questions that you can ask , which will push the conversation to a higher level .
I don &apos;t have to think about all these questions immediately .
And you want to think about things like quality of life .
Because you often have a choice , do you want a life that &apos;s free of pain or a long life that might be full of pain to the end ?
There are things you have to talk about and think about now with your family and your loved ones .
You might change your mind in an active moment , but at least you &apos;ve practiced this kind of thinking .
Remember , the brain is secreting cartel under pressure , and one of the things that &apos;s happening at the moment is a set of jobs stopped working .
There &apos;s a evolutionary reason for this .
When you &apos;re face to face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive obsession or sexuality or immune system , because if your body doesn &apos;t do metabolism on these things , and you don &apos;t respond very quickly with it , it might be food for a lion , and then none of these things don &apos;t matter .
Unfortunately , one of the things that might disrupt during stress is mental and moral thinking as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have proved .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead of these situations .
And I think the important point here is to admit that each of us has a burden .
We &apos;re all going to fail every now and then .
The idea is to think already about what these failures are to set up arrangements that might help you reduce damage or prevent bad things in the first place .
Back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I came back from my journey , the Institute installed a concert that agreed next to the door , which includes the opening of the front door , and you can remember the numbers .
And I have to admit that I still have piles of mail that I didn &apos;t release , and a few piles of emails that I didn &apos;t show .
So I &apos;m totally unorganized , but I see organization as a gradual process and I will be .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning .
Are you awake ?
They took me the card , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone write his name in Arabic on the card ?
One ! Nobody . Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , my friend and I were sitting in a restaurant asking for food .
So I looked at the person who helps us and said , &quot; Do you have a food lamp ? &quot;
And he looked at me in a jungle , and he thought he didn &apos;t make me well .
He said no ! It &apos;s called Menu , or Menu , is it French ?
Come on , come on , take this one !
I feel like when I was trying to talk to me , he said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re the last girl in the world , I won &apos;t look at her !
Two words made a young man of Pennsylvania controlling a girl sitting behind , ignorance .
How do you talk this way ?
So at that moment I started thinking .
I succeeded , of course !
I &apos;m in my country and I &apos;m not supposed to speak my language !
Where can this happen ?
How did we get there ?
Do I forget all my culture and all my ideas , all my intellectual inventors and all my memories ?
The best memories of war are childhood stories .
So who am I alone ?
Where &apos;s the logic of that ?
However , I tried to understand it .
And I don &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
Well , where can we use it ? We can all ask this question !
Well , you want us to use Arabic , where do we use it ?
This is a reality that exists .
But we have another more important reality that we want to think about and pay attention to .
The Arabic language or the mother language .
Innovation in other languages has a fundamental condition , which is the masterpiece of mother language .
How ?
Jabran Khalil Jabran when he started writing , he was writing in Arabic .
All his ideas , his imagination , his belly , the backyard and philosophy inspired by this kid sitting in the village where he grew up with a certain smell on a particular voice on a certain idea .
When he started writing in English , he had a big intellectual repository .
Even when he was writing in English , when we read his book in English , we smell the same smell ! We feel the same feeling .
We can imagine that it &apos;s the same that starts in English , the same that came out of the mountain , from a village in Mount Lebanon .
So this is an example that nobody can say it &apos;s not true .
And this is actually known by sophisticated people .
The Germans , the French , the Japanese and the Chinese , all the people know this fact .
So the laws support to protect their language .
So you measure that language .
So it &apos;s produced with it , and it &apos;s paid huge amounts to develop it .
So do we know more about them ?
Well , if we &apos;re not from the first world , we haven &apos;t come up with this sophisticated idea yet and we want to catch this modern world .
The countries that were like us , and they decided to pursue development and produce research and follow those countries like Turkey , Malaysia and others , those carrying their language and they &apos;re climbing this ladder , like the dictionaries . They kept it .
They made it close to them .
Because if you get any production from Turkey or other , it &apos;s not written in Turkish , it &apos;s not local production .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it was a local product .
They &apos;re going to be consumers , consumers of stupid , as we do most of the time .
To innovate and to produce it was necessary to maintain their language .
It doesn &apos;t matter who and why .
Language is not just for conversation , and any words come out of the mouth . Never .
Language represents certain stages in our lives , our emotions relate to them , and they relate to those terms .
Language is not a word and letter and letter and three matrix .
Why do we say this person understands and that doesn &apos;t understand ?
So if I said to you , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , &quot; &quot; or if your son came to you and said to you , &quot; &quot; Dad , did you live that history of the liberty logo and so forth ?
So what do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t feel a problem , I have to leave to speak seriously .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of something .
I have a friend of Franklin married by a French person .
I would ask her one day about her loved ones and so on .
Or do they want to be free ?
( Applause ) Well , what did we do to protect Arabic ?
Even though a lot of people said to me , &quot; &quot; What are you and this ?
Tell me and comfort and call you the head back . No problem !
We didn &apos;t say no , and we won &apos;t accept , and we &apos;re doing — we didn &apos;t follow this method because we won &apos;t understand this way .
And when someone tells me this way , I hate Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) — we want to see the reality of our circumstances and convince us in a way that mimics our dreams , our days , our aspirations .
A way to wear our same clothes , and think about the same way we think about it .
After that , we launched another campaign in which the viewer is placed on the ground .
Indeed , we should all not kill our language .
Because if language is killed , we will have to look for identity .
We &apos;ll go back to looking for existence .
We &apos;re going to go back to zero .
And this goes beyond just our loss of being present and contemporary .
Then we released images of young men and young men who were singing the Arab letter .
He photographed for young people and Coal young men .
We &apos;re very , very Coal .
And who would tell me , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You &apos;ve used the word &quot; &quot; English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;m adopting the word &quot; &quot; Coal , &quot; &quot; let them assume how they do , and they give me a more beautiful word than it , and they &apos;re consistent with our reality than it is .
So the idea is creativity .
Creativity in Mother is the way .
Let &apos;s start from now , from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel , produce a short film .
One novel can bring us back to the world .
You can bring Arabic back to the first place .
So it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution to the problem , but the solution is there !
But let &apos;s take care of it and convince us there &apos;s a solution , and we have to be part of this solution .
And in closing , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who tweets ?
But don &apos;t write &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; like Ma32nd !
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s a disaster , because this is not a language .
Because here you have entered a virtual world in virtual language .
It &apos;s hard for us to pick up what &apos;s ever beyond its levels .
So that &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are a lot of things we can do .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of the foreign punishment . ( Applause )
Sustainability is what , where , at least what can be made .
What I &apos;m working on is who and why .
I want to know the people who take my meals .
I want to know what I &apos;m influenced by them .
And I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know how to catch them .
I want to know how they depend on the absence of water in their lives .
To understand all this , we can change our perception of marine food from being goods to opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows us to celebrate the marine food that we &apos;re aware of .
So what &apos;s the name of this ?
I think we call it living marine food .
Where sustainability is the ability to tolerate and maintain , living is the ability to regenerate and progress .
Navy food allows living food to create a dynamic and dynamic system that recognizes our relationship to the oceans as a proposed resource in our engagement to regenerate the resources of the oceans and encourage their resilience .
It &apos;s more hopeful , it &apos;s more human and a more useful way to understand our environment .
Conservation evidence — the standard topic of a lot of seafood conservation communities — it &apos;s a really good and wonderful tool .
Red , yellow , green food lists .
The relationship is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , and think twice before you buy yellow .
But I think , that &apos;s not enough to eat just a green list .
We can &apos;t sustain this without measures to succeed in changing the fate of organisms on the yellow and red list .
But what happens if we just eat the green list ?
You have a yellow tuna that &apos;s been caught from the Arctic here — coming from a sustainable stockpile .
They were shocked from the Arctic — not show .
A very great deal for fishermen . A lot of money . It supports local economies .
But it &apos;s a sea lion . It &apos;s the most precedented .
What is the context of this meal ?
Am I sitting in a restaurant eating a 16-story piece of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
Maybe I stay on the green list ? But I don &apos;t do anything good for myself or for you or for the oceans .
The idea is that we have to look at context , as a measure of our work in all of this .
For example , I heard that red wine is good for health — antioxidants and minerals — heart health .
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to drink a lot of it . I &apos;m going to be healthy .
Well , how many of these troops would run before you told me I had a problem ?
Well guys , we have a proteins problem .
We lost that sensitivity when it comes to our food , and we pay the price .
The problem is that we hide the price under the waves .
We hide that cost behind social acceptance to expand the waist .
And we underestimate the cost behind cruel profits .
So the first thing about this idea of living marine meals is that they take our needs into account .
The best way to represent marine food is perhaps , not by knife or snack , or by strangers , but by giant green Julie .
Narrator : Maybe the oceans don &apos;t save .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
Well , surely I want to say that that green bar might be the new blue .
We have to keep eating the best possible marine food , anyway .
But we also have to eat it with tons of vegetables .
The best part of living seafood is that it comes with half a cochlear with a bottle of Tasco and lemon fibers .
It comes with five capacities of confused crystals with the decorated debt and the checklisted patterns and a hot pile of Bilbao Kinoqua with the cauliflower is very rare , and a restaurant and a bathroom from the outside with a little bit of hot crystal .
Ooh !
This is an easy sell .
And the best part is that all of these ingredients are in every family in Wal-Mart in the neighborhood .
Jimmy Oliver does a campaign to save America in the way we eat .
Sylvia is doing a campaign to save the oceans in the way we eat .
There &apos;s a sequence here .
Forget the nuclear Holocaust . It &apos;s the chocolate we have to worry about .
We destroyed the Earth and then used the food we produced to undermine ourselves in more ways .
So I think all the ways we eat are wrong .
And I think it &apos;s time to change what we expect from our food .
Sustainability is a complex process , but dinner is the fact that we should be very aware of .
So let &apos;s start from there .
There have been a lot of movement that has been supporting green in our food system recently .
Dan Barbarer and Alice Watts are driving the sweet green food revolution with passion .
But green foods are often represented in ways that don &apos;t make us consider that there &apos;s a responsibility for finance .
Just because it comes from green sources doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it without regard to shipping .
We have a friendly shrimp .
We can do it . We have technology .
But we can never get any environmentally friendly Buddha every single one of the shrimp .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Heart dinner is an important part of living seafood .
While we &apos;re trying to manage degradation in seawater creatures , the media is allowing the media to increase the consumption of seafood .
Studies say that tens of thousands of grandmothers and American grandparents , mothers and fathers may be born again if they eat more freely in their meals .
That &apos;s the sneakers I don &apos;t want to pass .
But it &apos;s not just about marine foods .
It &apos;s about the way we look for our health .
Being a chef , I realized the easiest way for me is to reduce the sizes of the parts in my desert .
Many things happened .
I made more money .
People started buying interviews and authority , because they knew they weren &apos;t just going to get through the major dishes .
People spent more time eating their meals , sharing with each other in food .
In short , people got more than they came for , even though they got less protein .
They got more calories during their diverse meals .
They became healthier . They made more money .
That &apos;s great .
And with the environmental aspects of every plate , but its presentation was with a large pile of human interests at the same time .
One of the other things we did was to start to inoculate the species that we present — the little silver , the magnitude , the sardine was the most .
True , seaweed , oyster , beach , beer — these were common dishes .
We were directing tastes towards more flexible and living choices .
That &apos;s what we need to support .
That &apos;s what the Green List says .
But that &apos;s also how we can start restoring our environment .
But what about these huge predators , these familiar creatures , the Green tuna list I talked about earlier ?
Well , if I have to , I have the recipe for you .
It works with any big fish in the ocean , and here it is .
I start with a 16-story piece of giant fish .
Take a knife . I cut it down to four parts .
Put it on four dishes .
I fill those dishes with vegetables and then I open your best bottle of pink , light the candles and celebrate it .
Keep the opportunity you have to eat this .
Let your friends and neighbors repeat this , maybe once a year .
I expect a lot of food .
I expect health , pleasure , family and community .
I expect to produce ingredients and make dishes and eat meals all part of the communication for human interest .
I was fortunate enough that my father was an amazing impression .
And it taught me since the boy about the privilege of food .
I remember good meals during my childhood .
It was enough protein that was presented with quantities of octopus and vegetables and small amounts of starches , usually rice .
That &apos;s mostly what I eat today .
I get sick when I go to the Stacey store .
I sweat about meat .
It &apos;s like a bottleneck trip .
It &apos;s sacred .
But all the serious news you &apos;re going to hear is that you &apos;re going to hear about the state of the oceans , and I have , unfortunately , a burden to tell you about whether or not all the time , your mother was right .
Do all the vegetables .
It &apos;s very straightforward .
So what do we look for meals ?
Well for health , I look forward to the good ingredients of my body .
For fun , I look for butter and sales and interesting things that make taste like cryptography .
For the family , I &apos;m looking for a recipe that reflects my personal history .
For society , we start from the very beginning .
There &apos;s no fact that anything we eat has a cosmic effect .
And we try to learn the best we can impact and then take the initiative to minimize that impact .
We &apos;ve seen pictures of our blue planet , our World Bank .
But more than just a storage of our resources , it &apos;s also cosmic geography of communication that we call a dinner meal .
So if we all take what we need , then we &apos;ll start sharing the remaining , and we can start celebrating , we can start restoring .
We need to taste vegetables .
We need to taste less seafood .
We need to keep dinner .
Thank you .

Hi . I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world who &apos;s building buildings with paper , like these cardboard pipes , and this is the first exhibition I &apos;ve ever done with cardboard pipes .
And it was in 1986 , much before the world started talking about environmental issues and ecological issues started a series of choices for cardboard tubes in order to use them as a building structure .
The testing of new materials is complex , and cardboard tubes have looked much stronger than I expected , and it &apos;s very easy to isolate against water , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to make it resistant to fire .
And then I built a temporary structure in 1990 .
And this is the first temporary building made of paper .
And there are 330 tubes , the diameter of 55 &#91; centimeter &#93; , there are only 12 centimeters of diameter , or four feet wide .
As you can see in the picture , it shows the water cycle .
And in the case of the oil spill , you can tear something out of the wall and use it ! ( Laughter ) It &apos;s very useful .
In 2000 , there was a big exhibition in Germany .
I was asked to design a building , because the subject of the exhibition was about environmental issues .
So they chose to build a wing with cardboard tubes and recyclable paper .
My design goals are not about building .
As far as it &apos;s about removal and demolition , because many countries build a lot of wings , but half a year later they end up rotating and leaving a lot of industrial waste , so the goal of the building that I designed was to completely recycle it .
After the end of using it , we could recirculate it with the moon .
And that was my design goal .
And I was very fortunate to win another competition to build the second Bombo Center in France in Metz .
And because I didn &apos;t have much money and I wanted to rent a office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , and so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on the roof of of the Bombo Center in Paris ourselves .
So we came up with cardboard tubes and wood joints to complete a 35-meter long office .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . But there was one big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , if one of my friends wanted to see me , he had to buy a ticket for that .
And that was the problem .
And then I finished building a Bombo center in a center .
And it &apos;s a very popular museum right now , and building that building was a big point for the government in front of the environmentalists .
But then I had a big disappointment in my career as an architect , because we weren &apos;t helping others , and we weren &apos;t working for the community , we were working for the rich , the government , the developers .
They have wealth and power .
And you have unseen traits .
So they would hire us to convert that power and wealth into something visible across those unique structures .
This is our profession , even historically — this is the profession of engineers so far that we &apos;re doing the same thing .
It was a great disappointment for us because we weren &apos;t working for the community even though there were a lot of people who lost their homes from natural disasters .
But I should say that this problem wasn &apos;t caused by natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes don &apos;t kill people , but the collapse of buildings is what it did .
And that &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
And after those crises , people often need some temporary housing , but there were no architects to help that because we were too busy working for the elite community .
So I thought that even though we &apos;re architects and we &apos;re not civic engineers , we can participate in rebuilding temporary housing .
We can make it better .
So I started working in disaster zones .
In 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
My Hutu and Tutsi tribe were killed .
And there are over two million refugees .
But I was surprised when I looked at the shelter , and a refugee camp that the U.N. organized .
It was so fragile , and people were freezing cold , even though there were buildings in the rainy season , in the shelters that the United Nations built , it was just a shirt of plastic , and refugees had to cut trees , to live something like this that shows you in the picture .
But imagine having two million people wanting to cut trees .
They set out to remove the big , fast forests , which caused a major environmental problem .
And that &apos;s why they started to provide a city tube and pre-industrial installations .
But it &apos;s too expensive that the eyes budget wasted and then went back to cutting the trees again .
So my idea suggested to improve the situation in order to use recycled paper pipes because they &apos;re so powerful and so cheap , my budget was only 50 dollars per unit of residential .
We built 50 units to do an experiment to figure out the column of units in terms of solidarity and humidity and white ants , and so on .
And then , a year after that , 1995 , in Cubay , Japan , hit a very strong earthquake .
Roughly 300 people killed , and a city like Jetta had all burned into the fire that broke down after the earthquake .
And also , there were many Vietnamese refugees struggling and gathered in the Catholic Church , the Church destroyed the Khmer .
So I went there and I suggested to the cafe , &quot; Why don &apos;t we build the church again with cardboard tubes ? &quot;
And somebody said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , are you crazy ?
Didn &apos;t you see that the fire ate the building , what does another building suggest from paper ? &quot; &quot; He didn &apos;t trust me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started moving to Cuban , and I met the Vietnamese community .
They were living like this with very bad plastic caps like this that appear in the picture in the garden .
So I proposed to rebuild . So I funded .
And I made a shelter of cardboard tubes , and it was easy to build these shelters with my students , and it was easy to demolish them , I used beer boxes as foundations .
And I asked Kerrin to help me because at the time , the beer company was making red plastic boxes , which didn &apos;t match the color of cardboard pipes .
The colors coordinate is very important .
And I still remember , we were imagining that they were sending us all beer boxes , but we got a blank of beer cans — ( Laughter ) I remember it was disappointing .
In summer with my students , we built over 50 units of shelters .
And finally , the priest expressed his confidence for me to rebuild the church .
And he said , &quot; &quot; As long as you raise the money yourself , and bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
She was supposed to stay there for three years , but the fact is she stayed there 10 years because people loved her .
And then in Taiwan , a big earthquake happened , so we proposed to donate this church , so we broke it up and sent it back to them and rebuilt it by volunteers .
And it &apos;s there in Taiwan right now as a permanent church .
So this building became a permanent building .
Which made me wonder what the permanent building is , and what is the temporary building ?
So even the building made of cardboard can become a permanent building if people like it .
And the armed concrete building can be temporary if people don &apos;t like it or if it &apos;s a goal to build for money .
And in 1999 , in Turkey , when a big earthquake happened , I went there and using local materials , I built camps .
And in 2001 , in West India , it was also a shelter .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka after the Summerwear earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt the villages of Islamic fishermen .
And in 2008 , in the Shuan Chengdu area in China , when nearly 70,000 people were killed , and a large number of schools were destroyed because of the dominant corruption between power and construction cooperation .
I was asked to rebuild a temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with Chinese students .
And in one month , we completed nine seasons with more than 500 square meters .
And those chapters still use , even after the last earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , a big earthquake hit the LAO .
And this is a very interesting picture : Berkeley shows the former prime minister of Italy and the former Japanese prime minister before , Mr. F. — you know , because we change the prime minister every year .
And they were very nice at a typical construction show .
And I proposed to rebuild a great , temporary hall of the music , because Luckilia was very famous for music , and the earthquake destroyed all the ceremony bubbles , and the musicians were throwing off Luckia .
So I proposed to the head of the town , my desire to rebuild a temporary hall .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Berkeley and he came out of the top of the 8 group , and our former prime minister helped me raise money , and I got half a million Euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary room .
In 2010 in Haiti also had a big earthquake , but it was impossible to fly there , so I went to Santa Domingo , next country , and we drove the car six hours to get to Haiti , and working with local students in Santo Domingo , we built 50 units of shelters with local cardboard tubes .
And this is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
After the earthquake and the tsunami , people were brought into big rooms like school halls for sports games .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
It causes mental and physical suffering .
So we went there to build cuts , and with the help of volunteers and cardboard tubes , it was like this after designing and building simple tires of cardboard .
And yet some shelter people didn &apos;t like the idea much , and they didn &apos;t want us to do it as they said , because simply , the control process of refugees becomes more difficult .
But it was really important to do that .
There was no horizontal space to build the one-floor government standard buildings like that .
Look at this . Even the buildings that the government adopted were this very weak picture , as a temporary building , and it was very narrow , and there was no way to store anything , and as well as leaking water into it , I thought we would build a multistory building because there was no horizontal space to build a single floor building .
So I proposed this to the head of the town when I was working with them in building cuts .
And finally , I met a very nice mayor in the village of Jonara in Miami .
I was asked to build a three-story building in the baseball field .
So I used shipping containers and also helped students design and create all the furniture of the building to make it comfortable , including government budgets , and it was exactly the size of the housing unit , but it was much more comfortable .
Many people wanted to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I work in New Zealand , Cyrus Church .
So about 20 days before the Japanese earthquake , they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were killed there and the most important cathedral in the city , which is a symbol of Cyrus Church completely destroyed .
And I was asked to rebuild a temporary cathedral .
It &apos;s now under construction .
I like to keep the texts and memorial buildings that people love .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What &apos;s in the mind of this child ?
If you &apos;ve asked this question 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , that this child is not unique , irrational and unaware of others — that you can &apos;t see things from somebody else &apos;s perspective or understanding the causes and consequences .
In the last 20 years , psychology has changed this picture completely .
So in some ways , we think this child &apos;s thinking is more like thinking about the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of that .
One of the things that this kid might think about , which might turn on his mind , is trying to guess what &apos;s going on in that other child &apos;s mind .
As we know , one of the hardest things we all have to get to what other people think or feel .
And perhaps the hardest thing of all is to realize that what other people think or feel is actually not exactly what we think or feel .
And each of the policy followers can witness how hard it is to understand this to each other .
So we wanted to know if babies and young children can understand that deep truth about others .
And the question now is : How can we ask them ?
So babies , despite everything , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three-year-old child to tell you what he &apos;s thinking , all you &apos;re going to get is a beautiful flow of circular dialogue in his consciousness of small festivals and Christmas enemies , and things like that .
So how do we really steer the question ?
Well , it turns out that the secret lies in the cauliflower .
And what we did — Betty Rachel and I , one of my students — is that we gave young kids two layers of food : a dish of unfolded cauliflower and another of the sweet pellets in a fish form .
And all the little kids , even in Berkeley , love the knife and don &apos;t like the uncooked cauliflower .
( Laughter ) But what Betty then did was she wasted a little bit of every plate .
Then she showed an expression as if you like that food or you don &apos;t like it .
Sometimes she acts like she loves a knife and doesn &apos;t like a cauliflower — just like a little kid or any normal person .
But in the other half of the time , what she was doing was taking a few cauliflowers and then blowing , &quot; &quot; Hmm , cauliflower .
It tasted the cauliflower . Mmm . &quot; &quot; And then you take some knife , and you cheat , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t bother Skype .
He complained the knife . He tortured me . &quot; &quot; So she showed that what you wanted was the opposite of what the child wanted .
We did this experiment with 15-year-old kids and 18 months old .
And then she would reach out to the baby and say , &quot; Can you give me some of it ? &quot;
And the question here is : What will a child give , what he loves is or what she loves ?
And what &apos;s remarkable is that the children who were 18 months old , who could barely walk and talk , would give them a knife if they loved the knife , and they would give them the cauliflower if they loved the cauliflower .
On the other hand , the kids are 15 months old , they &apos;ve been staring at them for a long time if they show their love to the cauliflower , as if they can &apos;t explain it .
But after checking for a while , they were giving it a knife , which they thought everybody had to love .
So there are two remarkable things about that .
The first is that these young people are 18 months old have actually come to that deep truth about human nature , which is that we don &apos;t always want the same things .
But more than that , they felt that they had to do what would help other people get to what they wanted .
But even more interestingly , if children can &apos;t do this , it suggests that these 18 months old children have learned this deep truth about human nature in three months since they were 15 months old .
So children know more and learn more than what we thought before .
And this is just one of the hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that have demonstrated that .
But the question you might want to ask is : Why do children learn this much ?
And how do they do that in that short period ?
After all , if you look at children in their backs , they look useless .
In many other ways they &apos;re actually worse than that , where we need to dedicate a lot of time and effort just to keep them alive .
But if we turn our attention to evolution looking for an answer to that dilemma , which is why we spend a lot of time taking care of young people who are useless , there will show us that there is an answer .
If we look at lots and lots of different animals , not only are we primates , but also other mammals , birds and even surgeries like changaro and the album , it will show us that there is a relationship between the length of a childhood that has a kind of a brain size compared to the size of the body and how smart it is and how adaptable it is .
And one of the very obvious examples of this idea is , these birds are here .
On the one hand , we see the new Calonia Grail .
And drinking and crystal casualties like goals and screaming and things like incredibly intelligent birds .
And its intelligence is also the intelligence of the canopy in some ways .
And this is a bird on the cover of Science magazine who learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our girlfriend the Independent House .
Chickens , ducks and winning your roommate are stupid birds as the most stupid .
So they &apos;re very good at picking up for love , and they &apos;re not going to do anything else .
Well , it turns out that young , young , new Calonia , unreliable screws .
She depends on her mother to receive worms in her tiny little mouths for a while she might reach two years , and it &apos;s a really long time in a bird &apos;s life .
The chicken reaches the tunnel in a few months .
So childhood is the one that explains why wars end up in the cover of Science magazine and end up chicken in the soup .
A long childhood thing seems to be associated with knowledge and learning .
So how do we explain that ?
Well , some animals , like chicken , seem beautifully fragile to donate just one thing .
So it looks terribly fragile to click for love in one environment .
Whereas other creatures , like drinking , don &apos;t donate to one thing , but they &apos;re very good at learning and exploring the rules in different environments .
And of course , we humans fall at the edge of the distribution like strangers .
So we have larger brains that are larger than any other animal .
And we &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re adaptable , we can learn more , we can stay in more different environments , we migrate and cover all the parts of the Earth but we went to outer space .
And our children and our children depend on us much longer than any other species .
My son is 23 years old .
( Laughter ) And until they &apos;re at least 21 , we still look at those worms in their little mouths .
Well , what &apos;s the secret about that connection ?
Well , one idea is that this strategy , the learning strategy , is a very powerful and very effective strategy to deal with the world , but it has one important barrier .
And this important factor is that until you &apos;re done of all that learning , you &apos;re going to be disabled .
You don &apos;t like to see the listeners contract to you and you ask yourself , &quot; The swallows or maybe the sketch will lead the object . Which is the best you see ? &quot;
You want to know all of that before the consumer actually comes out .
And the way that evolution — it seems to be — to solve this problem is to kind of divide the effort .
So the idea is that we have this early period where we &apos;re under protection .
And we don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can use all those knowledge that we &apos;ve learned as young and benefiting from to do things in this world .
So we can think of it as though babies and young children are more like the R &amp; D of human sex .
So the blue skies are good at it , and they don &apos;t have to go out and learn and be good ideas , and we &apos;re kind of like production and marketing .
We take advantage of those ideas that we &apos;ve learned as young and put into use .
Another way to think about it is : instead of looking at young people and infants as incomplete growth , we have to think of them as a different phase of evolution for the same kind — chips and sharks , for example — but they &apos;re actually the vibrant butterflies that are drifting around the park and exploring , and we &apos;re the larvae that are crawling slowly through the narrow adults .
If that &apos;s true , if these little kids are designed to learn — and this story about evolution is that children are feared to learn , this is what they &apos;re found for — they &apos;re expected to have very effective learning methods .
And in fact , the brain of the child seems to be the most powerful learner on our planet .
But the real computers in their basket are more efficient .
And a recent leap in our understanding of machine learning .
And they &apos;re all based on the ideas of this man , the minister : Thomas Paris , a statistician and mathematician of the 18th century .
And what Peace basically did was to create a mathematical method using the theory of probability to discriminate and describe how scientists come up with facts about the world .
And what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they see appropriate to start with .
They start testing them and compare them to evidence .
And evidence makes them prepare that hypothesis .
Then they test the new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Peace showed was a mathematical way of doing that .
And these mathematical rules are the basis for the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And about 10 years ago , I proposed that young kids might do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on behind those beautiful brown eyes , I think it &apos;s something that looks like this .
This is the idea of the Walker Pace .
So I think these young people are actually doing complex calculations using the cop odds they &apos;re dragging to figure out how the world works around us .
Well , now this sounds really hard to explain .
As we know , even adults when you ask them about statistics , they look very stupid .
So how does it make sense that these young people are doing statistics ?
To test that , we used our machine called the peacut detector .
And it &apos;s a box that goes off and plays music when you put on it certain things and not when you put other things on it .
And using this simple device , my lab and other labs have done studies that show how awful little kids learn about the world .
Let me just mention one of them that Thomas Cochener and I did , my student .
If I showed you this detector , the most likely idea to start with is to alert the detector is by putting the mold over the detector .
But in fact , this detector works in a kind of weird way .
Because if you wave a rope on top of it back and forth , which is hard to think about from the beginning , the detector works twice every three times .
However , if you do the most likely thing , which is to put a mold on top of the detector , the detector works twice every six times .
So the less likely hypothesis is the strongest in terms of evidence .
So apparently pollination is the most effective strategy of the other .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did , where we gave four-year-old kids this pattern of evidence , and we asked them to make the detector work .
And in particular , the children used this four-year-old manual to wave the mold over the detector .
And there are two interesting things about that .
The first is : — again — remember that these are four-year-old kids .
They &apos;re still learning lens .
But without knowing them , they do these very complex calculations that will give them a measure of the police probability .
And the other interesting thing is that they use this evidence to come up with an idea , and to put a hypothesis about the world of the ocean , it might seem very likely at first .
And in studies that we &apos;ve done in my lab a little bit earlier , similar to this , we &apos;ve shown that children are four years old are actually more skilled in getting to far more likely hypotheses than adults when they &apos;re given the same task to do .
So in those situations , children are using statisticians to learn more about the world , but as we know , scientists are also doing experiments , and we wanted to see if kids are also experimenting .
When kids do their experiments , we call it &quot; &quot; intervention in everything . &quot; &quot; And sometimes we call it &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; and a lot of interesting studies have recently shown that this is a meme and the theme is actually a kind of experimental research program .
And here we see one from the Christine Liger lab .
And what Christian did was she used petroleum detectors .
And what I did was it showed young kids that yellow patterns release the detector while the red doesn &apos;t make it work , and then I showed them a very anomaly case about that base .
And what you &apos;re going to see now is how this little baby will test five hypotheses over two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : What if we did this ?
Just like the other hand .
AV : Well , so his first assumption was proven to be mistaken .
( Laughter ) Child : These are lights , and this is : nothing .
AJ : Well here he comes out of his experiments .
Boy : What makes this damage ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AJ : Every scientist knows no doubt this quote of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , that &apos;s because this has to be put like this , and this has to be like this .
AG : Well , second hypothesis .
Child : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AJ : Well this is his next idea .
He asked the experimenter to do this , to try to transfer it to the same place .
But that didn &apos;t work either .
Child : Oh , because light comes out of this , not from that .
Oh , underneath this box has electricity here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
AG : Well , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Child : It &apos;s beating .
So when you put four .
So we need four on top of this to put two on top of this to illuminate .
AG : Well here &apos;s his fifth assumption .
In fact , this particular child — this is a love child and an extraordinary thinking organization , but what Christian discovered is that this is actually very natural .
If you look at how kids play , or when you ask them to explain something , what they &apos;re doing is actually a series of experiments .
This is a very natural thing for children at four years old .
Well , how does it feel like these kinds of organisms are ?
How does it feel to be one of those bright butterflies that can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
Well , if we go back to these psychologists and philosophers , many of them said that babies and young children barely understand what &apos;s around them if they have an awareness of the foundation .
And I think the right is the exact opposite .
I think young kids are actually more aware of us as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how the adult consciousness works .
The adult &apos;s eye and his realization kind of looks like a rubber exploration light .
So what happens to adults is that we decide that something is relevant and important , and we have to pay attention to it .
And the awareness of that thing that we pay attention to becomes so fast and fake and everything that we do becomes dark .
We also know something about how the brain does it .
And what happens when we focus our attention is that the prefrontal cortex , which is sort of the executive part of the brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain more resilient , and we &apos;re more able to learn , and it stops any activity in the brain .
So we have a very central attention , a very moving move .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young people have a consciousness that &apos;s closer to a light bulb from it to a fluid exploration .
So little kids are never good at narrowing their attention to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at understanding how much information is from so many different sources at the same time .
And indeed , if you look at their brains , you find them covered by these very effective neurotransmitters in the search for learning and flexibility , and the blurry parts haven &apos;t yet appeared .
So when we say that young kids can &apos;t focus their attention , what we really mean is they can &apos;t focus their attention .
So they don &apos;t want to get rid of all these interesting things that might tell them something and just attention to the important thing .
And this is the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we expect from those butterflies designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way to test a child &apos;s awareness and we &apos;re adults , I think the best way is to think about the situations where we find ourselves in a new position that we &apos;ve never experienced before — like being in love with a new person , or visiting a new city for the first time .
So what happens then is that our consciousness doesn &apos;t narrow , it expands , and those three days in Paris seem to be more attention and experience than all of those months that you &apos;ve been through as a zombie walk and talk and get meetings at the university and come home automatically .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee that you &apos;ve been drinking down , is actually simulating the impact of those neurotransmitters in young people .
So how does it feel like to be a little kid ?
It &apos;s kind of like being in love and you &apos;re in Paris for the first time after you drank three Aspario &apos;s toes .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a wonderful way of living , but it seems to lead you to wake up at 3 a.m. ( Laughter )
It &apos;s also good to be an adult .
I don &apos;t want to be involved in talking about the magnificence of young children .
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
We can connect our shoes and crossing the road depending on ourselves .
And it makes sense to spend a lot of time paying young people to think as adults think .
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , with open mindset and a desire to learn , large-scale imagination , creativity and innovation , and if for at least a part of the time we have to pay adults to think closer like children .

I &apos;m going to share with you my story of how I became an activist in the fight of HIV and HIV .
The name of my campaign is Singh .
In November of 2003 , I was invited to participate at the launch of the Nelson Mandela Foundation called 46664 , a foundation that meant fighting HIV and HIV .
And the 4664 is the number that Mandela was carrying when our record was on the island of Rubin .
And this is my picture with Yusor Durr on the concert platform , and I was very excited about my time .
The next day , all the singers were invited to join the Mandela tour in Rubin Island , where he gave a speech there to the press of the world standing in front of his previous cell .
And you can see the bars in the picture here .
And it was a wonderful reminder of the lives of most of us inventors .
At that moment , Mandela told the global press that there was a virtual slate being on the ground of his country , which was named after the time of apartheid , a rainbow , and there were thousands of people dying every day who were facing death as the first front force , who were the most vulnerable categories of women and children .
And I had a huge impact on my thinking , because I was a woman and a single mother , and I didn &apos;t know that AIDS and HIV were infected with women in that way .
So , I committed to that issue , and when I left South Africa , when I left D.C. Cape Town , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; This is something I have to talk about .
And I &apos;ve been involved in all the activities of the 4664 Foundation , and one of them that I can participate in , and I &apos;ve given journalism , interview enforcement , talking about the singing platform about it with the great effort that &apos;s worth the respect that Nelson does about it .
Every single person in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone who appreciate the effort of this person .
But did everyone know what was going on in his country in South Africa , a country that has the greatest percentage , and the biggest injury in the world in transmitting HIV ?
I think if we go out to the street and tell people what &apos;s going on there , the bed will definitely hit the bed .
And I &apos;ve been very fortunate for two years , because I met Zuckie Ahmed , who is the founder of the CDC campaign , an activist and a great campaign organization .
I met him at one of the activities of the 4664 Foundation .
And he was wearing T-Shirt like the one I &apos;m wearing right now .
It &apos;s a way , it &apos;s a tool to tell people that you are multiplied and sufficient with HIV , who live with HIV .
And because of that shame look , people who are carrying this virus , this is a tool to say , &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;ve got to get it out of the dark corners . I &apos;ve got to get it out of the public . I &apos;ve become part of the &quot; &quot; mobility to treatment . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m very proud of it because it &apos;s a pretty cool organization .
It &apos;s an organization based on 80 percent of its members on women , most of whom carry HIV .
And they &apos;re working in public to fight this virus .
And to connect people and to support those who live directly with the symptoms of this virus .
They have communal activities and educational programs .
It &apos;s about getting the shame look out of the square .
And it &apos;s a great job .
And my campaign , the Singh campaign , is to support the movement for treatment by raising awareness and fundraising .
And most of the donations that I &apos;ve been able to collect were going directly to the FDA and infecting their wonderful activities that they &apos;re doing that are still being done today in South Africa .
This is my Singh campaign campaign .
The Singh campaign is basically made up of me , and it &apos;s about three to four wonderful people who help me and support me .
I &apos;ve traveled the world in the last two and a half years to about 12 countries .
This is a picture of me in Oslang in Norway that received a heat donation , and here &apos;s a sitting in Hong Kong trying to raise donations .
And here in Johannesburg , where I gave the opportunity to play the white community there , to the middle class , who came out of the show , dismissed their tears , because I used some video files that touched their hearts , that were moving a real picture of the tragedy that was happening there that people were trying to forgive their eyes , because they were weaker than their faces , because they didn &apos;t know what the solutions were .
Aaron Motsdie , the Minister of Health , brought the ceremony , and I had a chance to meet him , and he gave me a complete commitment to make a real change in this case , which is very much needed today .
This is an image of Scottish Parliament .
It &apos;s become a permanent cycle for Scotland , for HIV .
And I was showing them some of my experiences in this field and trying to spread awareness of this issue .
And this is in Edinburgh with a wonderful group of kids .
Most of these kids are dying of HIV .
And here &apos;s a picture in New York with Michelle Sedapi , the Public Theater of the UN AIDS program .
And I was very proud when Michael invited me a few months ago to become an ambassador of the United Nations AIDS program .
And in this way , I was strengthening my curriculum in routing and communicating , and I was pushing my voice to reach further places .
The goal of the U.N. program working on seeing the world has completely eliminated the risk of HIV transmission from mothers to their children in 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we think we can get there with political will .
It can happen .
And here I am with a pregnant woman with HIV , and she &apos;s smiling , we &apos;re both smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because this young mother gets the right treatment , and she &apos;s going to be pregnant to take care of her little baby who &apos;s going to kill her soon .
And the child will get an antiviral transmission therapy from mother to child born , which means the child will be born without HIV .
This is a prevention that has been given since the beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to get rid of the AIDS epidemic .
Now I want to end with a short story about Evelly .
This is Evelly , and she agrees everywhere I go .
And I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of the millions of days of AIDS and HIV .
Evelly &apos;s mother had HIV , and she died of AIDS .
And Evelly is HIV-positive , and I was born with the virus .
And here &apos;s her picture , and she &apos;s seven years old , she doesn &apos;t weigh more than one year-old child .
At this point in her life , she had very advanced AIDS phases , and she had pneumonia .
I had met her in a hospital in the Western Cape , and I spent every afternoon with her , a wonderful girl .
The doctors were there , the nurses . They were wonderful . They were very special .
They put Evelly in its own food system , and they adopted it very well .
And nobody knew when the hospital was going to leave when we shot a movie about it , and we didn &apos;t know if it was going to survive AIDS .
It was really , very emotional , and I left the entire team influenced by this unique experience that I fell in front of us — this kid , you know , made a wonderful story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa and met Evelly again .
I started to feel shame in my body . I don &apos;t know if you can see my hair from here , I started to feel rough .
Because I know what I &apos;m about to show you .
Evelly has improved in a very extraordinary way .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
( Applause ) This applause is actually the right of doctors and nurses who have taken care of my iPhone .
They all have the best to improve and transform the case of Evelly .
And I want to say to everyone in the audience here , if you think that every mother and every child in the world deserves to get the treatment and nutrition that is appropriate and achieve the development goals that the U.N. has put , especially the fifth and sixth goal of this plan , and that all governments around the world have to be able to achieve , especially in the sub-Saharan Africa can now stand up for you .
I think it &apos;s possible to say that everyone here in this room thinks that .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago in the Old Soviet Union , a team of engineers were moving around with a large body secrecy across the abandoned countryside .
With it , they were hoping to bring human minds everywhere to be the first to open space .
The rocket was huge .
He had a silver ball in his nose with a radio .
On October 4th , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists at the time wrote that we were about to create a new planet that we would call Sputnik .
In the old days , explorers like Fasco da Gamma and Columbia had the fortune to open the globe .
Now we have the fortune to open space .
It will cover us who come into the future , and you see snippets from Sputnik , my fifth documentary , which I doubt is complete .
It tells the story of Sputnik and the story of what happened in America as a result .
For days after Sputnik , it was a remarkable museum .
A moon of human making can be seen by the ordinary habitat showed horror and pride that humans have finally launched a body into space .
But only three days later , on my red Monday , journalists and politicians told us , that Sputnik was evidence that our enemy had preceded science and technology and that they are now able to attack us with hydrogen bombs using Sputnik missiles .
She did not retire .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three trauma of America , historians say it &apos;s the equivalent of Pearl Harbor and September 11 .
The missile gap hit rockets .
He exploded a gun race .
He started the space race .
In a year , the incarceration of Congress has increased a huge weapon , and we &apos;ve gone from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
And the reaction went a lot further than the weapon increased .
For example , some here remembers this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Exploration trial where tens of millions of people in 78 underground cities .
Or a poll survey that showed that seven out of every 10 Americans believe that a nuclear war will start , and that at least 50 percent of the population will kill .
But Sputnik has made great changes as well .
For example , some of you in this room went to school with a grant because of your tongue .
Engineering engineering , mathematics and science generally — explodes .
And Vencent Circle explained that Sputnik led directly to the advanced research agency , the Internet , and of course NASA .
My documentary films show how a free society can lead by people who know how to use media .
But it also illustrates how we can transform what looks like at the beginning as a bad situation to something that is in a very good sentence for America .
Sputnik will soon come out .
In closing , I &apos;d like to take a minute to thank one of the investors of the old TED astronauts , Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .

Thank you , Chris .
Today , I noticed a coincidence lady who lived in my soul and announced that I was a scandal . &quot; &quot; Which means that when it comes to logic and illusion I don &apos;t even blame them because I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; So when my father asks a question and my answer is a title for a civilizational proposal , there &apos;s never been a punishment for it ! &quot; &quot; Because I &apos;m a schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say that thing .
And when my son says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the good thing that &apos;s going on with you , son ? &quot; &quot; I say , sometimes in the class , maybe I &apos;ll stop pouring my thoughts to ask , you ! Those books have never been on my feet ? &quot; &quot; Yeah , I decided to deal with the three languages equally because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; pure . &quot; &quot; But who controls the page ?
Because the English language is a multifaceted speech , and it &apos;s subject to unlimited changes . Now you might think it &apos;s easier to speak in English not intact , but here to tell you that Americans &quot; &quot; boys &quot; &quot; look like a liberty for the Brits . &quot; &quot; So when my professor comes to the class and says , &quot; &quot; Hi , &quot; &quot; I stop him saying , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re not disconnected . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s great . I &apos;ll say that too . That &apos;s great .
The word &quot; &quot; emphasis &quot; &quot; has never occurred , because this is the concept of English . &quot; &quot; If I had an acoustic ability , I would have sang this from the top of any mountain , across the suburbs , from every neighborhood , because God is the only language that ever recorded the origin of this world that says &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; So I don &apos;t always stand in front of you with the discourse , but I don &apos;t speak at all , I can &apos;t speak at all .
And then I change it so that I don &apos;t feel bored anymore , sometimes I slaughter two languages when I use the other one in the classroom , but when I pull them all wrong , I feel insane as I cook in the bathroom . I know I &apos;ve got to borrow your language , because my language has been stolen . But don &apos;t expect me to talk about your entire history , while my history is all obsolete . These are the words from a stranger to the ideology that I &apos;ve been raped for the long term .
I &apos;m talking about a language that &apos;s nonviolent to remind us of these fragile wounds that our status quo is not ambiguous . I &apos;ve been asked by passive images that make people worrying . What you haven &apos;t seen stealing banks , stop prescribing my hair bad . I &apos;ve been asked by that silly racist variation . So don &apos;t pay attention to your hair so that your hair is known to make donations . As far as your group is concerned , let me shut down .
This is not an invitation for ignorance , this is a linguistic celebration . So I put &quot; &quot; Tripples of Olen . &quot; &quot; I could help you create a market consumers , whatever I wanted them to know , and when they call me for the interview , I would be very happy to show them that I could say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s good ? &quot; &quot; And of course what &apos;s going on , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; Thank you .

Good morning . Magic is a great way of staying at the bottom of the curve of reality , to make it possible today what science will make tomorrow .
And as a cyber magician , I integrate the elements of illusion and science to give us an idea of how we can test future technologies .
You may all have heard of the Google Glass Project .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look through it and the world that you see concentrated with data : the names of places , the world , the buildings , and maybe one day , maybe even the names of strangers that you pass through on the street .
So this is my view of the illusion .
It &apos;s a little bigger . It &apos;s a prototype .
And when you look through it , you take a look at the brain of a cyber trickster .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a toy paper . Any paper is going to work .
Like this . Let me put a tag on it so that we can recognize it when we see it again .
Okay . Very big sign .
And let &apos;s go back to the package , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s start .
( Music ) Voice : The system is ready . Get the picture .
MT : For those of you who don &apos;t play with the cards , the cards of play are made up of four different organizations : the red hearts , the trees , the quantum hearts and the black hearts .
The cards are among the oldest symbols , and they &apos;ve been explained in many different ways .
Now , some say the four groups represent the four chapters .
There &apos;s spring , summer , fall and sound : my favorite chapter is winter . MT : Yeah , it &apos;s my favorite one .
The winter chapter is like magic . It &apos;s a change time , when the warmth turns into a cold , and the water turns into ice , and then everything disappears .
And there are 13 cards in each group . ( Music ) Voice : Every card represents a phase of the 13th Campaign cycles .
MT : So here we see the islands , and here we see the tide , the moon in the middle .
Voice : The Moon is one of the most powerful icons of magic .
MT : There &apos;s Greece in the Play-Doh .
There &apos;s red and black , represented by continuous change from day to night .
Voice : Marco , I didn &apos;t know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And by chance , there were 52 cards in the play paper , just like there were 52 weeks a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you add spots on paper cards combined , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days a year , the number of days per birthday .
Hold on . ( Screaming ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell me , otherwise you won &apos;t .
MT : Well , in fact , it was my sixth birthday when I received my first play cards , and since that day , I traveled all over the world to perform magic shows for boys and girls , for men , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , they were thrilled . They watched .
Wake up .
JS : Wow . MT : Are you ready to be in the party ?
JS : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you have .
JS : I present to you my poo stick . MT : Ah . I feel .
JS : Oh , oh , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I &apos;m performing for a different kind of audience .
I do for you .
Voice : Information card was revealed . MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how to be magical ? Is it a job from 9 a.m. to 5 a.m. ?
Of course not ! You have to do it all the time .
I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
All the time it has a kind of exaggeration , but it requires practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that should be a superpower evil for nature . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
Well , so , I &apos;m just saying , no , no .
And in fact , in German language , it &apos;s Najmuddin . ( Laughter ) Magic is not that density , but I have to warn you , if you ever play with someone who distributes cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of winning it are 4.165 for one .
MT : Yeah , but I think my hands are better . We overcome rare possibilities .
Voice : I think you &apos;ve got the wish of Mildy.M. : And this leaves me with another , and the most important card of all : that &apos;s a very big sign on it .
And unlike anything else we just saw , virtual or L.A. sound : the expected card was detected .
MT : This and without question is the real thing .
MT : Goodbye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I worked at MIT for 44 years , and I brought the TED Conference .
And the third issue is kind of less obvious .
Do you all agree ? No , not entirely .
I &apos;m going to buy it . I have a lot of money .
I have a lot of money that keeps me forever .
I grew up in Bihar , the poorest country in India , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember going home one day to find a cart full of candy in front of the house .
My brother and I were attacked and my father came home .
And it &apos;s very angry , and I still remember how we cry when that vehicle with our half-inch soup took off of our hands .
Later , I realized why my father was angry .
This candy was a bribe of a contractor who was trying to make my father reward him with a government contract .
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and his situation was strictly against corruption , despite the antidote and threats .
His conflict was individually , because Bahar was also the most corrupt state in India , where blind employees were trusting themselves , rather than serving the poor who had no way of expressing their own carbon when their children were food and not education .
And I had a similar experience that beat my grandfather , when I was traveling in remote villages to study poverty .
As I moved from one village to another , I remember that day I was very hungry and humiliated , and I was about to collapse , in the wake of the Redwood under a tree , and at that moment , one of the most powerful men of the village invited me to Coach and fed me with generosity .
But what I really realized was that what I was feeding my whole family for two days .
This original generosity challenged and changed my goal in life .
I &apos;ve become a bug on giving .
Later , I joined the World Bank , who seek to fight poverty by transforming aid from rich countries to poor .
My primary work focuses on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Uganda Ministry of Finance so they could get our loans .
But after classes , I remember finding one of my travels to Uganda a newly built school without books or teachers , new health clinics without medication , and poor again without voice or resources .
It was Bihar again .
Bihar has been a development challenge . The poorest is surrounded by corruption .
Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than a dollar and a quarter of a day , and the work I did in Uganda is the traditional approach to solving these problems that have been practiced since 1944 , when the consultants came to World War II , 500 foundations , and one institution , and they came together in New Hampshire , in the United States to founded the foundations of Princeton Woods , including the World Bank .
And that classic approach of development , consists of three key components , or no transfer resources from rich countries in the north to poor countries in the south , with a list of reforms .
Secondly , the development institutions that directed these transportation processes were ambiguous , and I decided to transparency about what was funded , and what results they achieved .
Third , working in developing countries was with a narrow class of government elections with a little bit of citizens , who are the final beneficiaries of development aid .
Today , each of these elements is opening up as a result of big changes in the global stage .
Open knowledge and open hardware and open management , all of them represent three key transformations that have transformed development , which also has a huge amount of problems that I &apos;ve seen in Uganda and Bihar .
The first of these major transformations is open knowledge .
You know , developing countries today are simply not going to accept the solutions given to them by the United States or Europe or the World Bank .
They get inspiration and their hopes and their practical skills , from the success of the emerging economies in the south .
They want to know how China has lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , and how the Opportunity Opportunity program has improved the educational and nutritional level of millions of children .
This is the current ecosystem of open knowledge is not only moving from north to south , but from south to south , and even from south to north , so that the Airondex Mexican program today inspires New York City .
And just as transportation processes are opening from north to south , also opening up the development institutions that are directing transportation processes .
And this second transformation : open aid .
Recently , the World Bank opened its information storage for public use , forcing 8,000 economic and social indicators of 200 countries in 50 years and more , which led to a global competition to crowdsource source applications using this information .
Today &apos;s development institutions are also opening up the projects that they &apos;re funding for public investigation .
Take the geographic map . In this map of Kenya , the red dots show all the money schools from the donor side as the green shadow increases , the more children without schools .
This simple combination reveals that donor routes have not funded any schools in the areas where more children have no schools , which raises new questions . Are the primary assistance targeting who the most need for our help ?
In this way , the World Bank now has a geographic map of 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and the donors are using a shared platform to map all of their projects .
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and responsibility to help .
And this brings me to the third , and in my opinion , the most important shift in development : open management . Governments today open up as citizens demand to hear their voices and accountability .
From Arab Spring to Anna Hazart &apos;s movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not only for political accountability but for growth accountability .
Governments are providing services to citizens ?
So for example , many governments in Africa and East Europe are opening up their budgets to the public .
But , you know , there &apos;s a big difference between a public budget and a budget that can be accessible .
This is a general budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really available or understandable for a normal citizen trying to understand how government spends its resources .
To address this problem , governments use new tools to visualize budgets so that they become more accessible to the public .
In this map of Moldova , green shows those areas that have low school spending but good educational outcomes , and the red line shows the opposite .
The tools like this have contributed to converting a whole letter of ambiguous documents into visual information understood to the public , and what &apos;s interesting is that with this openness , there are new opportunities for citizens today to create opinion and share with government .
So in the Philippines today , parents and students can start their real mirrors on Checkochol.org , or using SMS , whether teachers or textbooks are in school , the same problems that I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
And the government responds . So for example , when reports on this site reported that 800 students were at risk because the reforms in school stopped because of corruption , the Ministry of Education and Education in the Philippines took rapid procedures .
You know what &apos;s interesting is that this innovation is now spreading from south to south , from the Philippines of Indonesia , Kenya , Colombia , and beyond that .
In the peace house , Tanzania , even the poorest communities were able to use these tools to express their ambitions .
This is what the Tenda map looked like in August , 2011 , but within a few weeks , college students were able to use mobile phones and open-source platform to dramatically change the entire community infrastructure .
And what &apos;s very exciting is that citizens were then able to give their information about health points or water that didn &apos;t work , and they &apos;re all in the red bubbles that you see , which together provided a visual drawing of the voices of poor people .
Today , even Bihar rotates and opens up under a committed leadership that formed a transparent and accessible government and responds to the poor .
But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in openness or in service of the poor , and that &apos;s a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are the only warriors like my father and many others , and the only key to the structural work is to help these veterans alone in the hook so they can overcome the odds together .
For example , today , in Ghana , courageous composers of civil society and parliament and government , have opened a alliance for transparent decades in the oil sector , driven by this filmmaker in Parliament right now achieving a novel decade .
These examples give new hope , new possibilities for problems that I witnessed in Uganda or my father faced in Bihar .
Two years ago , on April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was too late at night , and at the age of 80 , he was writing a public interest raising from 70 pages against corruption in a road project .
He &apos;s not a lawyer , he &apos;s attacked the case in court himself the next day , and he won the court , but later that evening , he fell , and he died .
He fought to the end , with a fragile depth of fighting corruption and poverty , he doesn &apos;t just have to be honest government officials , citizens have to support each other to make their voices heard .
This has become the limits in life and the journey in which we travel between that reflected the change in the landscape of evolution .
Today , I am inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that we &apos;re in the World Bank , and we embrace these new trends , a huge difference from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
And we need to openness radically in development so that knowledge flows in multiple directions , the practitioners inspire , and aid becomes transparent , responsible and effective , then governments and citizens open up and enable them to reform with government .
We need to generalize these transformations .
And if we do that , we will find that the collective voices of the poor in Bayhar are heard , in Uganda , and beyond that .
And we &apos;ll find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
We will find that these kids , too , have a real opportunity to break their way out of poverty .

Imagine that there &apos;s an airplane at 250 children and a disease about to fall , if you know how that stopped , would you do ?
Now imagine there are 60 airplanes filled with kids under five that fall every day .
That number of children didn &apos;t get to age five .
6.6 million children will never get to age five .
Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the great killers of children under the age of five , and what we can do to prevent those diseases is not the smartest new technological innovations .
It &apos;s one of the oldest innovations in the world : a soap piece .
The soap washing , the habit that we all do , you can reduce infection for half , and you can reduce infection by a third .
The soap washing can have an effect of reducing flu , committing , and SARS , and very recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key prevention methods is to wash hands with soap .
The soap wash keeps kids in schools .
It prevents infant mortality .
The soap washed one of the most effective ways in terms of the price that protects the lives of children .
It can protect over 600,000 children every year .
This is parallel to prevent 10 jambo planes full of babies and children from falling every day .
I think you agree with me that it &apos;s a very useful public health approach .
So now let &apos;s take a minute .
I think you need to recognize people .
Who &apos;s next to you . Why don &apos;t you blame them .
Please hang on each other .
Well , get in touch with you .
They look really good .
Okay .
So what if I told you that the person who received him actually doesn &apos;t wash his hands when he comes out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t look good anymore , right ?
Very disgusting , you probably agree with me .
Well , the statistics actually show that four out of five people don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
And the same thing , we don &apos;t do when we have a luxury toilet , where running water and soap are available , it &apos;s the same thing in the country where the child mortality is really high .
What is this ? Is there no soap ?
Actually , soap is available .
In 90 percent of the homes in India , 94 percent of the homes in Kenya , you will find a boy .
Even in countries where soap is lower , like Ethiopia , we get to 50 percent .
So why ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
Why is May , this little boy I met in India , not washing his hands ?
Well , in the family of Milk , the soap is used to bathe , and it &apos;s used to wash clothes , to wash dishes .
His parents sometimes think it &apos;s a thin commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a closet .
They &apos;ll keep it away from them so they don &apos;t waste it .
On average , in the family of Milk , they will use soap at best to wash hands once a day , sometimes once a week .
What &apos;s the result of that ?
Children pick up diseases where they &apos;re supposed to love and protect them , in their homes .
Think about where you &apos;ve learned to wash your hands with soap .
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s hard to change the habits you earned early on .
However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local behavioral rules are the thing that shapes how we change our behavior , and here &apos;s where the private sector comes .
Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 or she will buy this piece to protect her family .
Many women in India will tell you that they learn everything about health habits , diseases , from a soap that holds the brand of Live Buy .
The famous brands like this have a responsibility to do well in places where they sell their products .
From this belief , in addition to the large-scale Linuigh , it allows us to continue talking about soap opera washing and healthy habits with these mothers .
Big companies and brands can change and replace those social behaviors and make a difference in these dirty habits .
Think about it : marketers spend all of their time making us shift from one brand to another .
And in fact , they know how to turn science and facts into convincing messages .
Just imagine for a minute , when they put all their energy behind a strong message as the power of soap washing .
The profit will turn into health outcomes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the brand of Steve Boy was launched in 1894 in Victorian England was actually launched to fight cholera .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the Minister of Health , and if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at that moment .
After a hundred and 18 years , the solution is exactly the same : make sure they have a way to get to this soap piece , and they use it , because this is the number one way to actually stop the spread of cholera .
I think this profit drive is strong beyond borders , sometimes more powerful than the most committed philanthropy or government .
Government does what they can , especially in terms of epidemics , for example , cholera , Ebola at the moment , but with competitive priorities .
The budget doesn &apos;t always exist .
And when you think about this , you think about what &apos;s needed to make a daily washing machine , that needs constant funding to improve this behavior .
In short , those who fight for public health actually rely on soap companies to keep encouraging their hands on soap operas .
We have friends like American assistance , partnership of the public and private sector of soap opera washing , London &apos;s school for health clinics and tropics , and because , Waterhead , they all believe in a profitable partnership for both sides .
It &apos;s okay for the public sector , because we &apos;re helping them get to their goals .
We &apos;re comfortable with the private sector , because we &apos;re building new generations of the future of washing hands .
More importantly , profits for those who are more susceptible to diseases .
In October 15 , we will celebrate the global day of hand-washing .
The schools , the communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , that day even our competitors , we all share to celebrate the most important public health media in the world .
What it takes , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , comes out of the creative thinking that drives the invitation .
If you take our campaign to help a child get to age five , we create movies that provide a message that washes the hands with the normal person in a way that might be related to it .
We had over 30 million views .
Most of these discussions are still happening online .
I urge you to take five minutes and watch those movies .
I &apos;m from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
I grew up in a family where every dinner was about social justice .
I trained in European school for public health .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) About nine years ago , I decided , with the successful public health profession , that I could make the biggest precedent , selling and promoting the best inventions of the world in public health : soap .
Today we run the largest hand-washing program in the world with any standard public health .
We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have a ambition to reach a billion by 2020 .
Over the last four years , businesses have grown digitally , whereas child mortality has said in all places where soap use has increased .
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and protecting lives in one way or another equal in the same sentence — but business growth is what allowed us to continue performance more .
Without it , without talking about it , we can &apos;t achieve the change we want .
Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers who did the same thing : baby death .
I &apos;m a mother , and I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
This is from Myanmar .
It has the most beautiful smile . The smile , I think , that gives you life when you have a second chance .
Her son , Mo , is her second son .
She has a three-week daughter , and we know that most of the kids who actually died in the first month of their life , and we know that if we give a soap for every single elbow , and that if we use soap before we touch babies , we can reduce and make a difference in those numbers .
And that inspired me , inspired me to complete this task , to know that I could do it with what &apos;s needed so that she could do the most beautiful job in the world : feeding and her country .
And when you think about the next time in a new mother &apos;s gift and her family , don &apos;t think long : buy her soap .
It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
I hope you share us and make hand washing part of your daily life and our daily lives and help more kids like Mo to get to age five .
Thank you .

These are simple things : hours , keys , activity , glasses .
These are the things that the victims of ethnic prejudice took in Bosnia with them to their final ideals .
We all know these ordinary things , which we use every day .
Some victims had taken personal things like toothbrush and toothbrush completely demonstrated that they had no idea what was going to happen to them .
They &apos;re often told that they will be replaced with the war prisoners .
These things were restored from a group of mass graves all over my country , at the same time , legal medicine structures were beating in a mass grave that was recently discovered , 20 years later on the war .
And you &apos;re probably the biggest one that &apos;s ever been invented .
During the four years of conflict that destroyed the Bosnian nation in the early 1990s , there were about 30,000 citizens , most of them civilians , who were killed , or thought they were killed , and 100,000 others were actually killed during the war .
Most of them were either killed in the early days of war or at the end of hostile work , when the U.N. security zones fell like Sryntha in the hands of the Arab army .
The International Crime Court issued a number of judgments about crimes against humanity and ethnic preparation .
The ethnic prejudice is the destruction of a frozen and organized destruction of a political or religious or ethnic group .
As far as ethnic hygiene is about killing .
It &apos;s also about destroying their property and their cultural inheritance , and ultimately destroying the deep idea that they were originally found .
It &apos;s not just about racial hygiene of killing ; it &apos;s about identity bank .
There are always evidence — no perfect crime .
There are always remains of people who consume that remain more silent than their fragile bodies and our selective memory of them .
These things were restored from many genocide graves , and the key goal of collecting these things is a unique process to identify who disappeared in murder operations , the first ethnic preparation of European soil since Holocaust .
None of these bodies have to remain unexplored or unknownst .
Once they &apos;re restored , they &apos;re recleaned and analyzed by the things that victims carry with them on their way to executing very carefully , and they &apos;re backed and stored .
Thousands of artifacts were fed in plastic bags like you see in the CSI series .
These things are used as a tool for legal medicine to visually identify the identity of victims , but they &apos;re also used as valuable legal evidence in criminal crime courts .
The survivors are sometimes invited to try to identify these things personally , but the personal browser is extremely guaranteed , and it &apos;s a painful and inadequate process .
Once legitimate doctors and doctors and lawyers of these things end , they become a narrative sweetheart .
Many of them are thrown away , believe first , or simply put on the shelf far from sight and from minds .
I decided a few years ago to photograph everything that was extract in order to create visual archive so that survivors could easily browse it .
As a storyteller , I want to respond to the community .
I want to move beyond raising awareness .
In this case , one can recognize these things , or at least these images will remain as a permanent male , unbiased and accurate for what &apos;s going on .
Photography is about empathy , and the kindness that these things give will include this empathy .
In this case , I &apos;m barely a tool , a legal doctor , if you penetrate this , and the result is that photography is as close as it is to document .
Once all the missing people are identified , alone the transmitted bodies in the cross and those ordinary things will remain .
With its simplicity , these things are the last certificate to identify the identity of victims , is the last remembering of the rest of those who lived originally .
Thank you very much .

And that can &apos;t be true .
I &apos;m for chocolate cake .
So I &apos;d like to show you some of what I &apos;ve been working on .
There are many things I learned from practicing the 30-day challenges .
That was part of the challenge that I took a picture every day for a month .
I was never that adventure .
It was bad .
It actually has a lot of fun .
( Applause )
Hi . So today I &apos;d like to share with you some projects in action .
Since we &apos;re still beginning to make these projects real , we &apos;re still working very much in the world of intuition and ambiguity .
So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiments that we &apos;re looking at in every project of projects .
So the first project called Empire colors .
The vacuum enters the room and it almost has no idea , and it &apos;s paying attention to these paintings by installing a fingerprint on the wall .
In a second , as if the paintings had noticed that there was a vacuum , it seemed to shine and clapping in a controlled coordination .
( Laughter ) So this is a drawing of both cases .
One is a complete mess . The other one is a complete arrangement .
And we were interested in seeing the simplicity of the change it takes to shift from one state to another .
This also reminds us of two very different conceptual traditions .
One is the sludge paintings in the 15th century , and the second tradition is about 100 years old , abstract Malayfischz combinations .
So I &apos;m going to take you to watch a video .
To give you an idea of scale , the altitude of the biggest painting is about two meters .
That &apos;s about this altitude . It &apos;s about the size of A4 .
So the vacuum goes into space , and it quickly belongs to the paintings .
And after a while , if the vocabulary continues to space space , the paintings will become kind of forbidden for the abundant existence and become individual again , so that you feel there in the room or the environment , where you &apos;ll notice it again .
( Laughter ) So here it looks like a vocabulary is the one who sends the sense of order in the paintings , but it might be the other way around , that paintings are stuck in their acquired behavior so that they impose the vocabulary the role of the typography .
So this brings me to a more quieter and smaller project called mobile phones .
The vacuum sees a piece of paper written on the far end of the wall , but when you get close , you see it &apos;s a blank sheet about A4 , or a piece of paper the size of a letter , the laptop of the two sides with two small hands that seem to be sculpted in detail and careful care of a small cube of wood .
The vacuum also sees that this whole sculpture moves slightly , and it &apos;s like these hands are trying to carry the paper with a big constant for a long period of time , and somehow you can &apos;t do it .
So the instability of this movement is very much like the exhaustive nature of the images that we see through handheld cameras .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two intersections .
One is through a fixed camera and one through a handheld camera .
And you immediately see how the vibrant nature of the video indicates the presence of a viewer and a personal perspective .
We just took the camera off and moved that move to the painting .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
But for us , we &apos;re kind of trying to provoke this feeling of shy gesture , and it &apos;s like there &apos;s a little guy with two hands blown behind this enormous piece of paper .
This is kind of the volume of pressure produced by a vacuum service and by presenting this piece of paper very precisely in front of the vacuum .
The other project is called Food .
This is a cartoon model , and the object is about as high as I am .
He has a broken body , two arms , an antenna like the head , so long , and his only goal is to grab attention to himself .
So when a vacuum passes , it sort of tends on one side to the other , and it moves its arm with a growing face with the person &apos;s approach more .
So here &apos;s the first test .
You see that the two movements are intertwined , and the whole thing seems to share with his whole body by expressing this on his head .
But the idea is that when he gets the attention of the person , he loses attention , and he starts looking for the next person to attract his attention .
( Laughter ) So this is the ultimate holographic of the taste .
It looks like it was produced in large quantities like it had come out of a factory like electrical and washing machines .
Because we &apos;re always working from a very personal space , we like how this cosmetic consumer element is removing the character &apos;s character from the object and giving us a little bit of space around it , at least .
And so for us this is a kind of evil species that tries to get your attention to the things that you really need , but it might be a character that needs a lot of help .
The next project is purpose , which is also a kind of acoustic machinery .
The size of a school that &apos;s about the size of the audience as it looks to someone on the stage .
So from where this is , every one of you looks this big , and the audience kind of takes all of my perspective .
In this audience , 996 little shape .
It &apos;s mechanically able to clap its own will .
Which means that each one of them can decide whether and when they want to applaud , their degree of applause , and how they want to be influenced by what they &apos;re about or how they want to affect others , and if they want to share innovation .
So when the audiences stand in front of the audience , there will be a reaction .
It could be a few filters or a hot one , and nothing would happen next until the curator left the stage , and again the audience would respond .
The reaction may come from a few very weak apples of individuals in the audience , or may be very loud distraction .
So for us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as something for itself or in which it was his own neighborhood that also has a kind of musical property , a musical machine .
So the vocabulary can play with it by sparking sound patterns or musical patterns that are very complex and very different , but it can &apos;t excite the audience to do any kind of reaction .
So there &apos;s a sense of control and mood and stress about it .
It has a property that &apos;s worrying and deceptive .
So here you see that we &apos;re very excited about the image of the head divided into the hands .
So here &apos;s a simple visual illustration , like the sides of the brain are interacting with each other to give a sense of binary and intense .
And here &apos;s a prototype .
We can &apos;t wait until we surround 996 of them .
Well , this is the last project . It &apos;s called Airport Airport .
The idea of a window .
This is a real window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made of three wires of wood pieces .
So we used the same window vocabulary to create our framework or our networked network in the room that can be seen from both sides .
The network is held by a tribe of small forms .
It &apos;s also made out of three different sizes , as if it suggests a kind of perspective or view in the one dimension .
Each of these shapes can also run backwards and backwards and hide behind two passengers .
So in contrast to this court network , we wanted to give these forms a very commonplace and hybrid recipe , like the puppet engine had taken and actually moved them on the track .
So we like the idea of moving these forms along the course as though they &apos;re absent and annoying and happy and satisfying , until you feel a kind of movement from the vacuum and you &apos;re going to hide behind the fastest wall .
So for us , this work also represents the contradiction of it .
These forms are kind of tangible in this very powerful network , which is a prison , but they &apos;re also a castle , because they allow shapes to be absent and naive and exhilarating and very absent from the outside world .
So all these real characteristics that I &apos;m talking about are translated into a very specific technical form , and we were very lucky to collaborate with the University of ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
So you see that they &apos;ve taken the motor instructions out of our paintings and created a vibration that integrates the slow head movement with the movement forward and backwards .
It &apos;s really tiny .
You can see it expanding in the palm of my hand .
So imagine our excited when we saw it actually work in the studio , and here it is .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was in college , I was a government career , which meant I had to write a lot of papers .
Now , when any normal student writes a piece of paper that looks almost like this .
You see — ( Laughter ) — the work at first is slow , but you &apos;re done in the first week enough to make you see the next heavy days look good and nice . ( Laughter )
And I hope I do this in the same way .
That &apos;s how the plan will be .
I &apos;m going to start writing the schedule for the project , and then it &apos;s time to write , and I end up like this .
( Laughter ) And this happens in every paper I write .
Until I was asked to write out 90 pages , a paper that we were supposed to work on all year !
And for a piece like this , my usual workaholic table was not an option .
Because the project was huge .
I started planning the project , and I decided the schedule had to look something like this .
That &apos;s how you spend the year .
I &apos;m going to start easy and light work , and then I &apos;m going to increase the effort a little bit in the middle of the year , and at the end of the year I &apos;m going to work as hard as I have — it &apos;s going to be as easy as climbing a staircase , a temperature .
How hard could the staircase be ?
It &apos;s not big , right ?
But something happened to me .
In the first few months .
She came and went very quickly , and I couldn &apos;t do anything .
So I decided to change my plan a little bit .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But in fact it was the middle of the year very quickly , and I didn &apos;t write one word . So I &apos;m here !
It shrunk for one month , then two weeks .
And one day I woke up , and there were only three days left on the delivery ! And I didn &apos;t write any word yet , so I did the only thing I could do , I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours , and I continued two full days without sleep , and Homo sapiens shouldn &apos;t sleep , I ran out of college , in slow motion , taped the paper on exactly the date .
I thought I &apos;d done everything .
A week later , I got a call , it was a call from college .
They asked , &quot; &quot; Are you Tim Orbin ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; We must discuss with you about your thesis . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the best thing we &apos;ve ever seen in our lives .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This didn &apos;t actually happen , actually . ( Laughter )
It was bad lungs beyond borders . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought , &quot; &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was so bad .
Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer and an online banker .
I write in a blog called &quot; Wait , but why ? &quot;
Two years ago , I decided to write about marketing and recording .
My actions have always been liberating untouched people around me and why I do my work , and I wanted to explain to those and to the world , what &apos;s going on in the heads of the people who are blogging and questioning their work , and why are we so .
I had a theory that said that the brains of the encyclopedia were really different from other people .
And to test this , I found a laboratory that allowed me to use the MRI machine to photograph my brain and the brain of another man who doesn &apos;t work to be able to compare them .
And I brought the pictures with me to see them today .
Now I want you to take a closer look and see if there &apos;s a difference .
I know you &apos;re not all experts , and it &apos;s not clear , but just look , OK ?
So here &apos;s a picture of a brain that doesn &apos;t register .
( Laughter ) And now ...
Here &apos;s a picture of my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both brains contain &quot; &quot; decision-making , &quot; &quot; but the encyclopedia brain also contains a real-time monkey .
Now , what does this mean for the future ?
I mean , everything is fine until this happens .
Man : &quot; &quot; This is the perfect time to do this . &quot; &quot; The monkey says , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; So the guy is going to do something useful and productive , but the monkey doesn &apos;t like the plan , and the monkey takes the wheel and says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we read a whole Wikipedia page about a French scandal and Tonya ? &quot; &quot; Because I just remember that happened !
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll go to the fridge and see if anything changes in it 10 minutes ago .
After that , we &apos;re going to enter the YouTube cycle that starts with videos about Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends up very long after watching a meeting with Justin Bieber .
( Laughter ) The monkey : &quot; &quot; All this is going to take time , and there &apos;s no space to do anything today .
&quot; Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here !
This monkey doesn &apos;t look like someone you want a leader behind the rudder .
He lives completely in the moment of current .
There &apos;s no memory of the past , and I don &apos;t know about the future , he &apos;s just interested in two things : &quot; Simple and fun . &quot;
In the animal world , this is happening ideally .
If you &apos;re a dog , and you &apos;re nothing but easy and fun , you &apos;re successful at all scales !
( Laughter ) And for monkeys , humans are just another kind of animal .
They eat , they sleep , they breed , which would be normal in early times .
But if you don &apos;t notice , we &apos;re not in those times .
We &apos;re in a time of evolution and civilization and monkey doesn &apos;t know what that means .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s in our head , which gives us capabilities that no other animal can do .
We can imagine the future .
We can see the full picture .
And we can do long-term plans .
And the decision maker takes all of this into account .
And we just want to do what seems right and logical to do right now .
And sometimes it seems to do something that makes sense and fun at the same time , like having dinner or going to sleep , or enjoying the time of space .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a distinction between logic and pleasure .
Sometimes they agree .
And at other times , it makes more sense to work in something that &apos;s hard and unpleasant for the big benefit .
And here &apos;s where the exhibition happens .
And for the tourist , this exhibition always ends the same way , which makes it spend most of its time in the orange region , an area of fun and easy and totally separate from the logic circle .
I call it the Dark Garden .
( Laughter ) Now , &quot; &quot; Dark Garden &quot; &quot; is a place you all know , the encyclopedia is good .
A place where the activities of space are happening at a time is not really a vacuum time .
The fun you have in &quot; &quot; Dark Garden &quot; &quot; is not real , because it &apos;s not infinite , and the atmosphere around you is full of guilt , recovery , anxiety and hatred all the feelings of beautiful encyclopedias .
And the question is , when the monkey is behind the wheel is : How does the encyclopedia transmit itself to the blue area , a region where there &apos;s less fun and easy things , but much more important ?
Well , it turns out that what he &apos;s doing has a guard owner , a person who &apos;s always watching him and looking at him in the darkest , and I love him for a moment — a guy called the Party .
( Laughter ) Now , &quot; &quot; The Beatboxing &quot; &quot; sleeps most of the time , but it wakes up suddenly , when a very final date is approaching or there &apos;s a danger of embarrassment in front of people or loss of function , or any frightening disability .
And the most important thing is that it &apos;s the only thing that the monkey scares .
Now , this monster has become connected to my life in the last period , because TED Conference officials contacted me six months ago and let me talk about it .
( Laughter ) Of course I said , yes , my dream always was .
I talk at TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And in the midst of all these senses , the decision decision was thinking about something else .
He said , &quot; &quot; Are we clear about what we agreed with just a moment ago ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen someday in the future ?
We have to sit down and make the speech right now . &quot; &quot; The monkey said , &quot; &quot; I agree with you , but what do you think we open Google Maps , and we zoom in on the bottom of India and exploit it for two and a half hours until we get to India , to stop ourselves from this country ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
Six months into four and then two to one month — the TED Conference decided to announce the speakers at the conference .
And when I opened the site , I found a photograph of my face staring at me .
And guess who woke up ?
( Laughter ) ( Beatboxing ) He loses his mind , and in a few seconds , the system turns into chaos . ( Laughter )
And the monkey — remember , the monkey is afraid of the slippery monster — and it goes up to the tree .
And lastly , he was able to take the lecture and start the lecture .
Now , &quot; &quot; The Beatles &quot; &quot; represents all sorts of crazy behaviors at the encyclopedia , like how I could spend two weeks of all kinds of behaviors on writing one sentence in my thesis , and then , honestly , words come in continuously in two days to write eight pages .
This whole case with three characters , this is the encyclopedia system .
Not nice , but ultimately , it works .
And this is what I decided to write on the blog two years ago .
And when I wrote , I was overwhelmed with responses .
Thousands of messages got me , from all sorts of people , from all over the world , doing all kinds of jobs .
They were nurses , bankers , painters , engineers and lots of Ph.D. students .
( Laughter ) And they all said , &quot; I have the same thing : &quot; I have the same problem . &quot;
What struck me was the paradox between the light of speech I wrote and the weight of these messages .
These people were very frustrated about what their marketing did in their lives , about what this monkey did for them .
And when I thought about it , I thought to myself , if the marketing system works , what happens ?
Why are these people so frustrated ?
Turns out there are two types of marketing .
Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , all of the examples , all of them have a final date .
And when there &apos;s final date , the effect of the generation is content and compressed in the short term , because the Beatles intervene .
But there &apos;s another kind of gossip , a kind of thing that happens in conditions that have no end date .
For example , if you want to start a business literally , something in art , or a mathematician — these works don &apos;t have infinite date at the beginning , because nothing happened in the first place , whereas if you go out and you start working hard to get some activity to do other things .
There &apos;s also a lot of important work out of your work that doesn &apos;t include endless resources , like visiting your parents or sports and attention to your health , working to develop your relationships , or bad relationships .
Now , if the only encyclopedia to end these difficult things is through the Paradise , there &apos;s a problem , because in all these important businesses that don &apos;t have the end of the monster won &apos;t appear .
There &apos;s no date to wake up for . So , the effect of the generation is not going to occur , and therefore , these works will continue and expand forever .
And this is the kind of long-term description that &apos;s unseen and doesn &apos;t get too much about , like the first one : fun , short-term and content on final date .
And usually people suffer from the second kind of quiet and private .
And this marketing may be a big source of grief and long-term regret .
So I thought , this is why these people send me , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in a bad situation like this .
It &apos;s not because they care about a particular project .
It &apos;s because of that long , long-term generation that made them as outliers , sometimes , on their own lives .
Their frustrations don &apos;t come from not realizing their dreams , but because they couldn &apos;t actually pursue them .
So as I read the letters , I had a kind of inspiration : I don &apos;t think there &apos;s anybody who &apos;s not supposed to do it .
That &apos;s right , I think you &apos;re all encyclopedia .
Of course , you may not be chaotic — like each other . ( Laughter ) And some of you may have a good relationship with the date and commitment to it , but remember : the magic trick of the monkey is when there &apos;s no end date .
Now , I want to show you one last thing .
I call this : life schedule .
Every square represents a week in the life of 90 years .
There doesn &apos;t seem to be a lot of them , especially that we &apos;ve used a lot of them before .
I think we all need to take a deeper look at this table .
And we have to think about what we &apos;re really asking , because each one of us has something to do with his life .
We have to keep careful about the immediate pleasure monkey .
This is a job for all of us .
Because there &apos;s not a lot of boxes in the table , that &apos;s a job you have to start from today .
Um , maybe not &quot; &quot; today &quot; &quot; but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sometime soon ...
Thank you .
There was a man named William Sonson who was posted with the honor of Congress honor honor honor honor honor honor for his work on September 8 , 2009 .
That day , he was worried about American and Afghan forces on their way to an area in Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who were going to meet some local villages .
The favela fell in Cameron , and their lectures were taken from three directions , and among many accomplishments , the leader Sonson was honored to fight for a living fire to save the wounded and get the dead out .
One of the people I rescued was a drill , he was one of his colleagues trying to get to the medical evening helicopter .
And what was interesting about that day was that by accident , one of the members of the medical department was wearing a helmet with a Pro camera and he got the whole scene with this camera .
The photos that the leader Sonson and his team showed up holding that crazy soldier who had shot out in his neck .
They put it inside the helicopter , and at that moment you see the chief Sonson and he leaned to accept him before he turned to save more soldiers .
I saw this , and I wondered , where do people like this come from ?
What was this ? Deep feelings , very profound , make you want to do this .
There was love , and I wanted to know why I don &apos;t have colleagues like this ?
You know , in the military , they give birth to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves , to win others .
In business , we give a grant to people who are willing to sacrifice others to make us win .
We deal with things with hearts , right ?
And I wondered , where do people like this come from ?
So my first conclusion was that they were better people .
The excellent people are drawn to this notion of service .
But that explanation is completely wrong .
What I &apos;ve learned is that it &apos;s about the ocean , if you have an environment that &apos;s appropriate , each of us will be able to do amazing things , and the most important thing is that everyone can do this as well .
I had the great privilege to meet one of these , who we call heroes , who risk themselves and their lives in order to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they had one answer : &quot; Because they would do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s that deep sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are very important here .
The problem with these two concepts is that they &apos;re feelings , not commands .
I can &apos;t simply tell you &quot; &quot; trust me , &quot; &quot; you do .
I can &apos;t simply commit two people in collaboration , and they do .
Things don &apos;t go that way . They &apos;re feelings .
So where does emotions come from ?
If you go back to the past 50,000 years , to the Stone Age , to the early stages of the Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was full of risk , all those forces were doing everything they could to kill us .
It &apos;s not personal .
Whether it &apos;s about the weather , the scarcity of resources , or the sharp tiger of wine , all of those factors were working to reduce our life &apos;s longevity .
So we evolved to become social animals , live and work together , within what I call the safety circle , in the tribe cafe , where we felt belonged .
And when we felt safe with each other , the natural result was trust and collaboration .
There were benefits .
That means that I can sleep at night and I trust that there &apos;s one of the tribes that &apos;s guaranteed .
If we don &apos;t trust each other , if you don &apos;t trust you , that means you &apos;re not going to protect me from risk .
The system of survival is not good .
That &apos;s exactly what we live today .
The world is full of risks today , things that try to reduce our lives by reducing our success , reducing our chances of success .
It could be economic deficits , or shrinking the stock market .
It may be technology that makes your business system end up praying overnight .
Or it might be your competitors who sometimes try to kill you .
Or they can get you out of business , or at least , trying hard to get your progress or steal the idea of your work from you .
We can &apos;t control these forces .
These are real data , and they can &apos;t disappear .
The only variable is the working conditions within institutions , and this is where leadership matters , because the leader imposes the Joe of the work .
When a leader chooses to put safety and the lives of people inside the institution first , and to sacrifice their comfort and the tangible results so that people can still feel secure and belong , then things can happen .
I was on an aerial journey , and I was watching a crash where the passenger tried to climb into the plane before he called it , and I saw the responsibility for the gate and treating the man as a super-law , as a criminal .
He screamed in his face because he tried to commit a group before time .
And I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have to treat us as a herd ?
Why can &apos;t you treat us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; So that was exactly what she said to me .
She said , &quot; &quot; sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I will fall into trouble or I will be fired . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me was she didn &apos;t feel secure . Everything she was telling me .
She didn &apos;t trust her leaders .
The reason why we travel on South Pole is not because it doesn &apos;t necessarily run the best .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their teachers .
You see , if conditions are not good , we are forced to spend our time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that impairs our institutions from within .
When we feel secure within our institutions , we naturally gather our talents , our workforce and our work without the money to face the external risks and to the opportunities available .
The nearest analogy I can give to what a good leader might be , is father .
If you think about what a good father might be , what do you want ? What are the characteristics of a good father ?
We want to give our kids a chance , raise them and demand them if they &apos;re paid , all in order to grow up and achieve more than we have achieved .
Great leaders want the same thing .
They want to give a chance to their employees , to provide them a raise and advocate if they spend , to build trust themselves , to give them an opportunity to try and fail , all in order to achieve more than we imagined to achieve ourselves .
Charlie Kame , the CEO of a company called Nicholm Gamp in New York City , which is a technology company , Charlie pointed out to a very important point when he wondered if you were going through tough circumstances with your family , would you ever have to give up one of your children ?
We would never do this .
So why do we think about the possibility of giving up our employees in institutions ?
Charlie &apos;s Law applied to lifelong employment .
If you work in Nicholas Gambage , you &apos;re not going to be released because of problems in your performance .
Instead , if you have problems , they will train you and support you , just like we were going to do with one of our children when he comes home with a GG test .
What happens is the exact opposite .
That &apos;s why many people carry that intense hate and anger from some of those CEOs of your children because of their salaries and their unequal giving systems .
It &apos;s not about numbers here .
It &apos;s about dropping them to define leadership .
They &apos;ve lost this noble decade in society .
We know they allowed their employees to sacrifice themselves to protect their interests , but the evidence is , they sacrifice their employees to protect their own self-interest .
And that &apos;s what really bothers us , not numbers .
Are we any of us who would be upset if we gave Gandhi 100 million dollars as a grant ?
What about 250 million dollars for Mother Teresa ?
Will we have any pleasure ? Never .
The great leaders never laughed .
They have their employees to save their lives .
They would sacrifice their profits to save their employees .
Bob Chapman , who runs a big factory in the Midwest called Barry and Yemener , who has been dramatically influenced by economic inflation in 2008 , and overnight , they lost 30 percent of the requests .
In the case of a big industrial company , this is a big problem , and it might make them unable to afford their jobs .
They had to save 10 million dollars , so , as for many companies today , the board of the administration came together to discuss the salaries of workers .
But Bob refused .
See , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in the working hand .
Bob believes in the working heart , and it &apos;s harder than simply to drop the heart of a worker .
So they came up with a vacation program .
Every employee from the secretary to the CEO , was required to take four weeks as an unpaid vacation .
They could take it any time they started , and they had to not take it away .
But it was the way Bob announced this program that made the difference .
He said , it would be better to give all of us a little bit of pain , and some of us went up , and the staff &apos; content went up .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as they expected , when people felt safe and protected by their managers was the natural reaction of trust and collaboration .
And increasingly and unexpected , people began to exchange .
Who could afford more was to exchange with who could afford less .
Some of them took five weeks to get others just three weeks .
Leadership is choosing , not arrangement .
I know a lot of people at the top of the surveillance in their institutions who are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re a windowless force , and we apply what they say because they have power on us , but we didn &apos;t follow them .
And I know people who are at the base of their institutions don &apos;t have any authority but are real leaders , because they choose to take care of the person on their left , and because they choose to take care of the person on their right .
That &apos;s what a leader &apos;s word means .
I heard a story of some Marine Corps who went to one of the stages , and as often as the Marine Corps were the other officer of eating , and he made his team eat first , and when they finished , he didn &apos;t eat it .
And when they came back to the field , his man brought some food to him to eat it , because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re the ones who are ahead .
We call them leaders because they risk everyone .
We call them leaders because they choose to sacrifice to support their employees safe and protected and to benefit , and when we do this , the normal outcome is that our team is going to sacrifice for us .
They would give us their blood , their sweat and their blood to see that their leaders saw light , and when we asked them , &quot; &quot; Why did you do this ?
Don &apos;t you give your blood and your sweat and your blood to that person ? &quot; &quot; Their answer would be one : &quot; Because they would do this for me . &quot;
Isn &apos;t that the foundation we all want to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we can dream .
When I was a kid , I discovered that creativity is the key to crossing from dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Roth Titor , a Jewish refugee settled at the heart of the Andes .
So I grew up : I was encouraged to see beyond the border .
So a part of education involves helping them in remote communities , for indigenous people .
I apologize to those memories , because they helped me understand life outside the city , a life that is so full of possibilities , without barriers , like language or culture .
During those journeys , my grandmother was receiving King &apos;s poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go find it .
Go and look beyond the mountains .
Something missing behind the mountains .
You &apos;re missing and waiting . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the next few years , I became a medical student .
One in every hundred children born all over the world has a kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem that I think I can solve — the part that I &apos;ve spent my life working on .
The problem begins during pregnancy .
The fetus need to survive inside the mother .
Living alive depends on communication between what is my system and asthma .
At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
If the child doesn &apos;t close , the child has a hole in the heart .
It &apos;s produced by early birth and genetic disease .
But what we know today is that the lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
As you can see in the graph , the frequency of this kind of hole is dramatically increased with altitude .
Video : ( Child crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they begin to have a physical need for breathing .
To close the hole , the only solution was a major surgery .
So one night , my friend and I were , we were camping in the Amazon .
And the only thing that didn &apos;t burn in fire was the Vaucado branch green .
And then came the inspiration moment .
So we used that branch as a mold for our first invention .
It can be used to close those holes in the hearts of children .
Place is a piece of wire wrapped around itself .
Maybe it may not seem very thin to you now , but that was the first successful attempt for us to create a device for this big problem .
In this video , we can see how a very small trailer takes the luxury to the heart .
And then the turtle closes the hole .
After that moment of inspiration , a very long time of effort came to develop a prototype .
Studies took place in the lab and in the biosphere thousands of hours of work .
The philosophy , if you work , can save lives .
I came back from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have a chance to make a difference .
My wife and I , my partner , Dr. Alexandra Heith , started to see patients .
After treating patients successfully using our own alpha , we felt very excited .
But we live in a 23,000 feet high .
And the patients there needed a special device to treat their heart disease .
The puncture of patients is different , because the hole between the arteries is wider .
Most patients couldn &apos;t be treated at the right time , and they were dying .
The first philosophy was able to successfully treat half of the patients in Bolivia .
He started looking again .
We went back to the drawing board .
After many trials , with the help of my grandmother &apos;s friends from indigenous people in the mountains , we got a new device .
For centuries , indigenous peoples have told stories through complex patterns of urine , unexpected skill that helped us with the new device .
We took this conventional way of knitting and created a handheld design with smart materials that registered the form .
This time , the fabric allows us to create an unbelievable chamber because it &apos;s made out of just one piece .
It can change from itself to very complex structures by taking decades to evolve .
As you can see , the device goes into the body through natural channels .
All doctors do is close the trailer through the hole .
Our devices expand , the hole shut down .
We have a beautiful delivery system that &apos;s very easy to use because it works on its own .
There is no open surgery .
( Applause ) We as doctors , fight against diseases that take a long time to heal — if that happens .
This is the child we saw before , after the operation .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is concentrated in its place , the patient is 100 percent recovered .
From the beginning to the end , the whole procedure only takes 30 minutes .
This is very sad from the medical and humanitarian perspective .
We &apos;re very proud that some of the former patients have a part of our team — a team , thanks to the reliable interaction with the patients that work with us .
Together , we only have one idea : the best solutions should be simple .
We &apos;ve lost fear of making something new .
The road is not easy .
Many obstacles emerge all the time .
But we get power from our patients .
Their resilience and courage inspires our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is immunized , because of the cost or availability .
So we have to start an institution with a personal model .
We &apos;re going to give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
We &apos;re in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
This whole thing started with one impossible idea , as you would continue to do , really : no survey of any child .
Thank you very much .

Well , I grew up in Limbo , on the border between Libopo and Mumbaa , in a small town called Mottah .
Where water sources and electricity are unpredictable as it is for weather , and I grew up in these difficult conditions , and at the age of 17 , I was relaxed with my friends in the winter , in a sunbathroom .
The sun becomes very hot in the winter .
So while we were in the sun , my best friends next to me and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , no one invented anything you could put on your skin so that you don &apos;t need to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; I would buy this product if it was there . &quot; &quot; And then I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some shocking statistics .
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today don &apos;t get a lot of water and sanitation .
450 million of them are from Africa , and five million of them are from South Africa .
Many diseases spread in an environment like this , and the most dangerous of these diseases is resilience .
Communication is a pneumonia that affects the eye as a result of the brains that go into the eye , the repetitive infections of generosity can permanently make you blind .
This disease affects eight million people with permanent blindness every year . The shocking part of this is that to avoid the disease of generosity , all you have to do is wash your face : no need for drugs , no pills and no injection .
So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Well , even if I didn &apos;t do this for myself because I don &apos;t want to bathe , at least I have to do it for saving the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) With my good friend , my mobile phone is 634 — I had no laptop , I didn &apos;t get the Internet very much , except that I got 20 pounds a hour in the cafe — I went online and I got a blog out of data and I got blog in the blog cabinets — I &apos;d get blog .
It looked like a recipe for PCC , you know ?
And I said , well , we have the formula ready now .
We &apos;ve got to start doing it now .
Four years later , after writing a 40-page business plan on the mobile phone , after writing a patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent in my country , and — &quot; &quot; No bathroom anymore ! &quot; &quot; — I can &apos;t say more than that . ( Laughter ) Drake Baby invented the dry bathroom , the first toilet to replace the world .
You can actually put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to bathe .
( Laughter ) So after trying to do it in high school with limited resources , I went to university , I met a few people , and we started doing it , and we had a product that was totally ready to launch on the market , and it &apos;s already available in the markets .
We learned some lessons about the marketing of Drey Both and the marketing of it in the market .
One of the lessons we learned is that poor layers don &apos;t buy products in large quantities .
You buy products when you need , someone in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a cigarette package , they buy one cigarette every day , even though the price is richer .
So we fill Drey Both in these little , innovative bags .
You just have to hold it out of the middle and compress it to get the product out .
And what &apos;s great about it is that one casa is an alternative to one bathroom for five Rand .
And after creating this model , we also learned a lot about execution .
We realized that the rich kids in suburbia also want &quot; &quot; Drake Both . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we realized that we were able to save 80 million liters of water on average every time the bathroom is overished , and also providing two hours a day of children living in rural areas , which means two extra hours to school , two extra hours to do homework , two extra hours to live their childhood .
When we saw this big impact , we reduced it in our basic proposal value , which was about cleaning and comfort .
Drake Page is a relief to sing and saving lives for the poor .
After the execution forum entered us now , we actually went to selling the product to a global company to ask in the marketplace , and I have a question I &apos;d like to ask in the audience today , on the unintended ways of Libopo , and with 550 pounds a week , I brought the world a way to not bathe .
So what keeps you from bringing new ideas ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
There &apos;s another very important thing that I learned through all of this trajectory , last year Google made me as one of the most popular minds in the world .
I &apos;m also the best student with a project in the world , and the first African gets this observer , but there &apos;s one thing that connects me a lot , that I did all this because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .

Five years ago , I was on a scholarship vacation , and I went back to the University of medicine that I studied .
I saw real patients and not the white dog for the first time in 17 years , actually since I became a management counselor .
There are two things that surprised me during the month I spent there .
The first thing is the common issue of discussions that were about hospital budgets and low cost , and the second thing that really disturbed me , is , in fact , the number of colleagues I met , former medical school friends , I knew they were some of the smartest , most enthusiastic , passionate people I &apos;d never seen before , I found a number of them getting pessimistic , working alone , or rendering the hospital themselves .
So , with this focus on reducing costs , I asked myself , have we forgotten patients ?
A number of countries where I come from and where I come in conflict with health care costs .
It &apos;s a big part of national budgets .
And a number of different reforms are aiming at the very heart of this growth .
In some countries , we have long waiting for patients to do surgery .
In other countries , there are new drugs that don &apos;t pay attention , and so they don &apos;t get to patients .
In some countries , doctors and nurses are the goal , to some extent , to the government .
And after all , the expensive decisions in healthcare are made by doctors and nurses .
You have to choose to do an expensive laboratory test , and you choose to do an operation on an elderly patient .
So putting a limit to the freedom of doctors , this is how you control costs .
And ultimately , some doctors will say today that they don &apos;t have the full freedom to make choices that they think are appropriate for their patients .
So it &apos;s not surprising that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
In the Boston Insultant Group , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way to manage healthcare .
And we took a step back and said , &quot; What &apos;s the thing we &apos;re trying to do ? &quot;
Eventually , in the healthcare system , we aim to improve health for patients , and we need to do it at a limited cost or cost of affordable cost .
We call this healthcare on the basis of value .
On the screen behind me , you see what I mean by value : the percentage of the patients to the money we spend .
This is a beautiful project in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Tesburg .
In this picture , you see my wife &apos;s father and he has three beautiful daughters of his daughters .
When we started doing our research in the Boston Consultant Group , we decided not to look very much at the cost , but look at the quality rather than that , and in search , one of the things we couldn &apos;t escape from is the difference that we saw .
Compare hospitals in a country , and you &apos;ll find some of them are very good , but you &apos;ll find a lot of them that are much worse .
The differences were enormous .
Eric , my wife &apos;s father , suffered prostate cancer , and maybe he needed a process .
Now he lives in Europe , and he can go to Germany in which he has a good healthcare system I &apos;ve heard .
If he went there and went to an average hospital , he would have the risk of infection by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing the napkins again .
Unfortunately , with a piece of metal money , risk risk risk is 50 percent . That &apos;s very much .
If he went instead to Hamburg , to a clinic called Martin Clinton , the risk would be one in the 20th century .
Whether you choose to strike luck , or you have one in 20 danger .
That &apos;s a big difference , seven times difference .
When we look at a number of hospitals for a number of different diseases , we see these big differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
And the data probably doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going to the hospital is lucky .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There &apos;s hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish bone surgeons who met in their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they did when they ran a hip operation .
On the left-hand side of this slide , you see a difference in the metal pieces , artificial leaves that can be used to someone who needs a new hip .
They all realized their individual way of doing the process .
And they all said , &quot; &quot; My way is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them really knew , and I was approached by that .
So they said , &quot; &quot; Maybe we need to measure quality so that we know and we can learn better . &quot; &quot; So they actually spent two years discussing , &quot; So what &apos;s the quality in the hip surgeon ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we have to measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we have to measure that . &quot;
And eventually they agreed .
And when they agreed , they started measuring , and they started sharing information .
Very quickly , they found that if you put concrete in the patient &apos;s bone before you put the metal in it , that actually would last longer , and most patients would never have to do the operation again throughout their life .
They published the data , and it actually turned into a clinical app in the country .
Everybody saw that this had a big indication .
And since then , they publish every year .
Once a year , they publish the periodic table : Who is the best , and who is the bottom ?
They visit each other to try to learn , and so a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , the Swedish hip surgeons got the best results in the world , at least for those who were already measuring , and a number they didn &apos;t .
Now I found that this principle is really interesting .
So doctors come together , agree on what quality is , and start measuring , share data , find who is best , learn from it .
A constant improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not just the interesting part .
It &apos;s very exciting .
But if we go back to the cost side of the equation and look at that , it turns out , those who focused on quality , actually had less cost , even though that wasn &apos;t the goal in the first place .
So if we look at the story of the hip again , there was a study that was done two years ago where they compared American and Swedish .
They looked at the number of patients who needed to reprocess seven years after the first operation .
In America , it was three times higher than Sweden .
How much unnecessary operations , how much unnecessary suffering it is for patients who have been conducted in those seven-year-olds .
Now , you can imagine how much saving would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at the OECD data .
And the OECD , mostly , looks at the quality of care from which they can get information through members .
The United States has , for a number of diseases , actually , a minimum quality of the organization .
Now , if the U.S. health care system is more focused on measuring quality , and it increases quality only to the average level of the organization , it will save the American population 500 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the country &apos;s health care budget .
Now you can say that those numbers are awesome , and all of that makes sense , but it &apos;s possible ?
And that would be a lack of health care , and I would say that that could be done , but it should be done .
The agents of change are doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
Through my practice as a consultant , I probably meet a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and other workers in a hospital or health care every year .
The only thing they have in general is they care about what they &apos;re doing in quality for their patients .
Doctors , like most of you in the audience , are equally competitive .
They were the best in the classroom .
We were always the best in the class .
And if someone can show them that the outcome they do for their patients is not better than others do , they will do anything for improvement .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
Doctors have another property .
They &apos;re actually achieving success through the other survey .
If a heart doctor invited another heart doctor in a competitive hospital and discussed why that other hospital had much better results , they would share .
They will share the knowledge of how to improve .
So , by measuring and transparency , you get the continuous improvement circuit , which this slide shows .
Now , you might say this is a good idea , but it &apos;s not just an idea .
This is actually what happens .
We are the ones who create a global society , a vast global community , where we are going to be able to measure and compare what we &apos;re doing .
With two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the founder of Carolinska in Sweden , the Boston consultant group formed something we call ICH or MM .
You might think that &apos;s a holiday , but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a shortcut .
It &apos;s the International Society to measure health outcomes .
We combine the elderly doctors and patients to discuss , one disease , what is really good , what should we measure , to make those standards global .
They &apos;ve worked — I &apos;ve done four groups over the last year : white eye cells , ladder pain , artery disease , which , for example , heart attack , sulfur cancer .
Four groups are going to publish their data in November this year .
That &apos;s the first time we &apos;re going to compare apple with apple , not just within one country , but between countries .
The next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the next year , 16 .
In three years , we plan to cover 40 percent of the burden of disease .
Comparing apple to apple . Who is better ?
Why is that done ?
Five months ago , I was a leader of a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new executive manager , and she has a vision : I want to manage my large institutions more seriously , the results that matter to patients .
This particular day , we sat in a loop next to doctors and nurses and other staff , and we were discussing blood cancer in children .
The group argued , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure better than we do ?
We &apos;ve discussed how we can deal with these kids , what are the important improvements ?
And we discussed what costs to these patients , could we do more efficiently ?
There was tremendous energy in the room .
And there &apos;s a lot of ideas , a lot of excitement .
At the end of the meeting , the head of the administration , he was standing .
He looked through the group and said — first he lifted his hand , and I forgot — he lifted his hand , he met him , and he said to the team , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . And today , we finally discuss what a hospital is doing is the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring the value in health care , this is not just the cost but the results of this issue to patients , and we &apos;re going to make employees in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
I think that measuring value in healthcare is going to revolutionize , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , which always puts the patient in the center that he will smile in his grave .
Thank you .

I &apos;m happy to share with you some amazing results for me about what drives companies to succeed at the highest level , what are the factors that affect the success of start-up companies ?
I think the organizing of emerging companies , is one of the great ways to make the world a better place .
If you combine some people and give them fair incentives and you organize them in a start-up company , human energies will unleash in a way that has never been possible before .
You can push them to come up with amazing results .
But if the start-up organization is great , why does a lot of it fail ?
That &apos;s what I wanted to know .
I wanted to know what &apos;s the most important factor here for the success of start-up companies .
And I wanted to be systematic about that , to avoid any precedent or misconception I had from watching a lot of companies over the last few years .
I wanted to know that , because I started doing business since I was 12 years old , when I was selling candy at the middle school parking lots , and I made solar devices in high school to university where I made sound speakers .
And when I graduated from college , I started programming companies .
Twenty years ago , Idefab started , and in the last 20 years we started doing more than a hundred companies . A lot of them worked , and a lot of them really missed .
And we learned a lot of those failures .
And I tried to extend the factors that led to success and failure in these companies .
So I looked at these five factors .
First , the idea .
I thought the idea was everything .
I called my own company &quot; &quot; ideas lab &quot; &quot; to really like that moment when it comes to the idea for the first time .
But over time , I &apos;ve come to my thinking that maybe the team , the execution and the ability to adapt these things is more important than the idea itself .
I would never have imagined that I would have witnessed the quote of Mike Tyson on the TED stage , but he said one day , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , so he gets a complete on his face . &quot; &quot; And I think that &apos;s true and true for business as well .
A large part of the team &apos;s execution depends on its ability to adapt to receive a bone in the face of the client .
The customer is the real reality .
And so I got to think that maybe the team is the most important factor .
Then I started studying the business model .
Does the company have a clear way of producing customers &apos; revenue ?
And that &apos;s starting to get the summit in my mind about what are the key factors of success .
And then I looked at the dead .
Sometimes companies receive tremendous amounts of funding .
Maybe that &apos;s the most important factor ?
And of course there &apos;s time .
Is the idea coming back and the world not ready for it ?
Is it early , so that you &apos;re in the front and you have to define the world with it ?
Is it perfect ?
Or are they late , and there are actually many competitors ?
So I tried to study by embracing these five factors in many companies .
And I &apos;ve looked at companies with 100 ideas , and in another hundred unfolded to the corporate lab to try to figure out a scientific idea about this .
First , in ideas labs , the best five companies : CityseSarch , CarsDirect Direct to come , NetZero , Tickets.com , all of these have succeeded with billions of dollars .
And the five at the bottom Z.com , Insider Pagles , Myylife , Desktotok-and-Factorie , Peoplelinck was our hopes for it , but it didn &apos;t work .
So I tried to describe all the traits of how I felt about corporate performance in these factors .
And for companies that don &apos;t follow the idea lab , I looked at the amazing success , like Airbnb , Instagram , Uber , YouTube and LinkedIn .
And some failures : Webvan , Kozo , Pets.com , Flood z and Bendler .
Companies below had intense funding , and they even had business models in some cases , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
And I tried to look for the factors that were affected by success or spending all of these companies , and the results really surprised me .
The first influence factor was time .
The timing shows 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
The team and implementation came at the second time , and after the idea , the difference of the idea , the excellence of the idea , that came at number three .
It &apos;s not quite critical , it doesn &apos;t mean that the idea isn &apos;t important , but what really surprised me is that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important factor .
Sometimes the most important was the right time .
Last two , the business model and finance , they made sense to me .
In my opinion , it makes sense to be a business model in a low-ranking order , because you can start a project without a business model and add it later if the customer demand what you invent .
And for funding , in my opinion , if you &apos;re suffering from the lack of finance at the beginning , but you earn an attractive force , and especially in our current era , it &apos;s very easy to get dense funding .
Let me give you some examples of each of them .
Let &apos;s take Airbnb as an example of the success of everyone knows .
Well , that company knew it was going through a lot of smart investors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to rent a place inside their house for a stranger . &quot;
Of course , people have proved that this belief is wrong .
But one of the reasons this project worked alongside the good business model , and its good idea , and the excellent implementation , is time .
That company came out at the top of the economic whistle when people were in the most needed for extra money , and maybe it helped them overcome their rejection to rent their own home to a stranger .
Same thing with Uber .
Uber came out , an amazing business model , a great business model , also .
But the timing was really ideal because they needed drivers in their organization .
And the drivers were looking for extra money , which was very important .
Some early successes , Citysec , came out when people needed web pages .
Toy.com , which was announced at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for effective ways in terms of cost to get traffic .
We thought the idea was great , but in fact , time was more important .
And here &apos;s also after our failures .
We started a company called Z.com , and it was an online entertainment company .
And we were so excited about it that we raised enough money , we had a fantastic business model , and we even had agreements with wonderful talent from Hollyywwood.com to join the company .
But hacking on the broad range was very low in 1999- 2000 .
It was very hard to see the content of a video on the Internet , you had to go inside your browser and do all these things , and eventually the company broke in 2003 .
Two years later , when the problem of coding solved by Adobe Flash , and when hacking across the broad range , 50 percent of the American YouTube was a perfect time .
An amazing idea , but an incredible time .
In fact , I didn &apos;t have YouTube a business model when I first started .
It wasn &apos;t even sure it would work .
But it was a really wonderful place .
So what I &apos;m saying in conclusion , execution is really important .
The idea is very important , too .
But timing is more important .
And the best way to get to the right time , is to look at the accurate , if consumers are really ready for what they offer them .
And you &apos;re not really honest about this , you don &apos;t have to deny any outcome you see , because if you have something you love , and you want to push it forward , you really have to be honest at the time factor .
As I said earlier , I think emerging companies can change the world and make it a better place .
I hope that some of these insights may help you get a higher success ratio , and so you make something wonderful to come to me in the world , which would not happen in another way .
Thank you very much . You &apos;ve been a wonderful audience .

I was good at school . The projections for my generation were high , and Babbage entered medical life from lectures and concerts and robbery parenting .
But on the inside , I was actually very , very easy , unconfident , and really scared — scared of others , from the future and from failing and from the space that I felt inside me .
I was leaving a joke when it started , I was blogging myself , feeling exactly like I was doing hundreds of times before , and suddenly I heard a quiet voice saying , &quot; She &apos;s leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one but clarity and enthusiasm of this comment was not worrying about .
&quot; It opens the door . &quot;
That was the beginning , the sound arrived .
And the sound continued , days and then sold without a severe disconnect , all I did in a fuzzy form .
&quot; It &apos;s going to a lecture . &quot;
It was neutral , free of emotions , even after a while , it became exhausted and confused , even though I noticed its outer blowing back sometimes and it reflects sometimes my hidden emotions .
For example , if I was angry , and I had to hide it , and I was often very good at hide what I really felt , then the sound seemed frustrating .
A precise adaptation process started : Empathy that natural people don &apos;t hear those sounds and the fact that I hear them , it really means I have a very serious problem .
I spent some time talking to the general doctor of college .
And to be fair , I needed a very interesting diamond , and I started telling him about the weird sound .
For example , I was part of a student television station that was broadcast news all over the campus , and on a date that happened very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry Dr. , I should go .
And at this point , the events started to sing me very quickly .
It followed the hospital entry , which is the first thing of many things , the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the character came along , and then , the worst of all , there was a sense of toxic and fatal with despair , tail and asymmetry towards myself and my hopes .
But after encouraging me to recognize a voice not as an experience , but as a disease , my fear and my resistant to it .
Basically , this was like taking a hostile position towards my brain a kind of mental war , and that in turn caused the number of votes and growing them gradually and as a threat .
See that water cup ?
In fact , a vicious cycle of fear , of escape , of mistrust and misunderstanding was formed and it was a battle where I felt helpless and unable to create any kind of peace or reconciliation .
After two years , it was a dramatic hierarchy .
So far , I &apos;ve had all the symptoms of intimacy : terrifying sounds , horrible insights , strange , difficult illusions .
Now looking back at the wreck and despair in those years , it seems to me now that someone has died in that place , but another person has been rescued .
A broken person and a wounded person started that journey , but the person who came out was successful and will eventually grow to become the person I represent now .
A lot of people hurt me in my life , and I remember them all , but memories grow young and distracted compared to people who helped me .
And I think Eleanor can do that .
Sometimes , you know , the snow falls late in the month of Iran , but the summer always comes . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to thank those who were generous and good who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome my return from that tortured and isolated place .
At first , it was very difficult to believe this at least because the sounds were very hostile and threatened , so in this case , the first step came to learn to separate the metaphorical meaning of what I described as the real truth .
For example , the sounds that I threatened to attack my house have learned to explain as my own sense of fear and lack of security in the world , rather than being a real danger .
Now at first , I believed them .
I remember , for example , staying on a night passing the door of my father &apos;s room to protect them from what I thought was a real threat of voices .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
I have a plastic cup , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; A strategy plan .
It was armed with this knowledge , and eventually I would collect myself , every part of me represents a different voice , I would gradually pull out all my treatment , and I would go back to the psychiatrist , but this time on the other side .
Now I &apos;m very proud to be part of the International Organization Organization of International voters , an initiative inspired by Professor Marius Romi and Dr. Sandra Ishire , who identifies the hearing of sound as a strategy of sustaining a mental response to crazy conditions , not as a prescription of the exotic symptoms of schizophrenia should carry , but with a large , informed expertise .
This kind of community is not only possible that it &apos;s already on the way .
&quot; Once social change begins , it cannot be reflected . &quot;
You can &apos;t humiliate the person who feels proud .
You can &apos;t suppress the people who aren &apos;t afraid anymore .
In the last 20 years , the movement of sound hearing has created hearing networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to foster dignity and solidarity and to enable individuals from mental disorders to create a new language and practices of hope that are concentrated in the souls of faith that are not disturbing the power of an individual .
As Peter Levin said , a human being is a unique species with its instinct capacity to heal and intellectual spirit to harness these intellectual abilities .
In this echo , for individuals of society , there is no greater honor or privilege of making that process easier to heal to someone , to witness and to share the burden of suffering of someone , and to lose hope in their lips .
We &apos;re unique . We can &apos;t take advantage of us .
What lies inside of us can never be really colony , contaminated , or taken away .
Light never goes off .
As a great physician once told me , &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what others should say about yourself .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I came here to share with you my pictures .
Is it really pictures ?
So , of course , a picture like this can &apos;t be picked up with a camera .
My interest in photography started when I got a digital camera at the age of 15 .
And I mixed with my early statement with drawing , but it was a little different , because when you use the camera , the planning is the basis .
And when you take a picture of the camera , it ends up pressing the button .
So for me photography was more dependent on being in the right place at the right time .
And I felt that anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create what was different , and the process started when you press the button .
A picture like this : a building being built in a crowded road .
But it has an unexpected definition .
And yet it keeps a level of reality .
Or images like this are dark and colorful , but one goal is to preserve a level of reality .
When I say real , I mean the reality of the picture .
Because of course it &apos;s not something that can actually be picked up , but I always want it to look like it was taken as a photograph .
Pictures that drive you to think for a moment about the discovery of the trick .
It &apos;s about picking up a more idea than picking a real moment .
But what is the trick that makes it look real ?
Does that have to do with detail or colors ?
Or light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But ultimately , it sums up how we interpret the world and how it can be achieved on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not just about what &apos;s real , but what we think is real .
So I think the foundations are very simple .
I see it just as a mystery of reality where you can bring different pieces of reality together to create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three things that are imaginable , and we can all relate to the three-dimensional world .
But it &apos;s collected in a certain way to form what looks like a 3D model , like it &apos;s possible to exist .
But at the same time , we know it &apos;s impossible .
So we invent our brains because they don &apos;t accept the fact that that shape doesn &apos;t make sense .
And I see the same process in the composition of images .
It &apos;s about combining more than reality .
So what makes a picture that looks real is the things that we don &apos;t think of , the things that are around us in our daily lives .
But when we collect pictures , we have to think about them , otherwise they &apos;re going to be somewhat uncomfortable .
I &apos;d like to say that there are three simple rules to come up with a real outcome .
You can see these two pictures are not unique .
But when we put them together , we create something like this .
So the first rule is that composite images should bring together the same perspective .
Secondly , complex images have to recognize the same kind of lighting .
The two devil cores with these two pictures were taken from the same height and under the same lighting .
The third rule is the recognition of the limit that starts with different images and ends up making peace .
So it &apos;s impossible to figure out how the image was installed .
So by identifying color and variation and lighting at the boundary between different images and adding photographic impacts like the depth of the unsaturated colors and the noise , we scramble the boundaries between different images and make them look like one image , although the one image can basically contain hundreds of layers .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) Now , one of you might think it &apos;s just a picture of a landscape , and the bottom part is just what &apos;s been treated .
But actually this picture is completely composed of images from different places .
I personally think creating a place that &apos;s easier to find a place , because then you &apos;re not going to come up with a midst of ideas in your head .
But it takes a lot of planning .
Once I had this idea in the winter , I realized that I had several months to plan to find different places to collect puzzle pieces .
For example , the fish was shot on a fishing trip .
And the beaches are from different places .
The bottom part of the water is taken from a stone hole .
And I turned the house above the island to the red to make it tend to be the Swedish printer .
Having a real outcome , then you can customize it in planning .
It always starts with a diagram , with an idea .
And then you collect different images .
And here he &apos;s planning for every piece accurately .
And if you can take pictures successfully , you get very beautiful and very real results as well .
All the tools are around us , and our imagination is restricted .
Thank you .

We saw in April 3 , 2016 the largest data leak in history . The Panama Papers revealed rich people and powerful people hide enormous amounts of money in external accounts . What does that mean ? We borrowed Robert Butler from the Louise Windows to explain this issue , this week , there was a tremendous amount of stories that came out of the 111-million Sunday Office .
These papers leak from Banama is very small about the secret of the world transferring companies out of the registry country .
We &apos;ve got a steady look at how customers and bankers and lawyers go to lawyer companies like Moscow Vonica and say , &quot; &quot; Well , we want an anonymous company , can we give us one ? &quot; &quot; You have to now see email , and you can look at text messaging , and you can understand how this works , how it works .
Now , the immediate implications of this issue have already begun .
The president of Iceland prime minister resigned .
And we also have news that a craftsmen dictator of the Syrian monarchy also has companies and money outside .
And there &apos;s a 2-billion-dollar farmer coming back to the Russian president Fladmir Bhutine by his boyfriend of his intimate childhood , who became one of the best dealers of Chile .
There will be a lot of rich and other people who will be anxious about the next collection of stories and the next group of leaked documents .
Now this looks like a bunch of interesting spy movie or John Grimm novel .
This looks very far from you and me and from ordinary people .
So why should we care about that ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful people are able to keep their money outside and don &apos;t pay for the taxes they have to pay , which means that there &apos;s less money for public services that are necessary like health care , education and roads .
And this affects all of us .
So far , for my organization , Glass Witness , these leaks have become extraordinary and extraordinary .
We have the media and political leaders in the world who are talking about how individuals do it using the secret of transferring companies out and hide and stabilize their property — we &apos;ve been talking about this thing and revealed a decade ago .
Now , I think a lot of people find this whole world confusing and confusing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this kind of transfer money and companies outside the recording country works .
I like to think about it a little bit like a Russian blood .
So you can get a company involved in another company , involved in another company , which makes it impossible to really understand their nature and who stands behind their establishment .
It &apos;s very hard to law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists and civil society to understand what &apos;s going on .
I also think what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s a little coverage on this issue in the United States .
And this may come back to that some remarkable Americans have not been revealed in these leaks , in this space .
And that &apos;s not because there are no American athletes out there who have hidden their property by transporting it out .
But because of the way money and companies are transferred outside the country , Mosques Vonica has a few American colleagues .
I think if we see leaks from the Cayman Islands on the Caribbean , or even from the states of Delaware or Wyoming or the American Nevada , you can see many cases and examples that come back to America .
In fact , in a number of United States you need less information , you need to supply less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
This kind of secret in America allowed employees from local areas to run schools to deception and beat school students .
And it allowed the trickster to refine the poor investors .
This kind of behavior affects all of us .
Now , in the mountains of Witness , we wanted to see how that really works practically .
And how does this really work ?
So what we did was we sent a secret check to 13 legal companies in Manhattan .
Suppose he &apos;s an African minister and he wants to transfer talented money to the United States to buy a house and a plane .
And what was really shocking was that all of the lawyers except one of our investigators provided a suggestion of how to transfer these suspicious money .
All meetings were informal , and none of these lawyers were treated as a client , and of course there was no commercial deal to move money , but it really shows the problem in this system .
And it &apos;s also important not just to think about it as a single case .
It &apos;s not just one lawyer who talked to our secret rights and made suggestions .
It &apos;s not just political issue that &apos;s been arrested in a flash .
But it &apos;s about how this system works , which harnesses corruption , and escapes taxes , poverty and instability .
In order to address that , we need to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
This may sound like a false and inevitable appreciation , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has changed at all , like there &apos;s always rich and powerful people .
But with my optimistic nature , I see that we &apos;re beginning to get some change .
Over the past two years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards more transparency when it comes to owning a company .
This case was put on the political agenda by the British Prime Minister , David Cameron at the top of the eight industrialized nations held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
Since then , the European Union has brought to the bias of having centralized records at the national level about who has and really control companies all over Europe .
One of the sad things is that the United States is still really behind .
The legislation was presented by the Republican and Democrats in the House and Senate , but not the big progress that we want to see .
So we really want to see the leaks of Panama , this huge false view of the property transfer system outside of the registry country , used as a strategy in the United States and around the world .
For us in the mountains of Witness , this is a moment for change .
We need to angry ordinary people in terms of the way that people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; This is not a good secret to work and work owners . &quot;
We need to recognize and recognize the political leaders of this problem , and commitment to changing the law to detect this kind of secret .
Together , we can put a secret limit that allows now to escape taxes , corruption and money-laundering prosperity .
Chris Anderson : Hi Julian .
We &apos;ve been told that the WikiLeaks Encyclopedia , from your achievement has been released — in recent years , a lot of secret pages have been published more than every newspapers and news channels of the world together .
Do we consider that true ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , could it be real ?
It &apos;s worried — right ? — that all media channels in the world do not provide good media , and a small group of activists are able to publish more of that kind of information than the rest of the news channels in the world combined .
CA : How does that work ?
How do people send you these documents ?
And how do you believe in their privacy ?
Julian : This is — as I can say — a certain kind of people that have turned glasses into some problems , and we have a number of ways to deal with them that we can collect information for us .
We can say it &apos;s a secret code art to send things online , to hide discrimination features , pass them into legal directions like Sweden and Belgium to interact with and provide legal protection .
We get information through mail , normal mail , whether it &apos;s encrypted or not , we accomplish it like any normal news institution , we classify it — which is sometimes very difficult to do , when you talk about a huge information organization — and publish it to the public and then we defend ourselves against the legal and political attacks that are inevitable .
CA : So you &apos;re doing effort to make sure that the documents are legal , but in fact you don &apos;t know almost who this source of information is .
Julian : That &apos;s exactly that , yes . We very rarely know , and if we know at some point , then we destroy that information once we know .
( Dringing ) Damn it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the central American intelligence is asking what the code of TED is . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take an example , real .
This is something you &apos;ve been smuggling a few years ago .
If we could get this page out ...
This story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what I had leaked and how that happened ?
Julian : This is a Crol report .
This was a secret report by the Kenyan government after the election of 2004 .
Going back to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel Rabbi for 18 years .
It was a fairly fair dictator .
And when Kiki came to power — across a group of forces that were trying to fight corruption in Kenya — they issued this report , in about two million pounds of pounds on this and accompanied reporting .
And I kept the government and used it to political pressure on Moi , which was the richest man — and still the richest man — in Kenya .
It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
So I went there in 2007 , and we trained to wait for that because of the election — the national election , December 28 .
When we published that report , we did it three days later for the new president , Kibucky , who decided to believe with the gentleman who was out of his office , Daniel Aarbay , and then this report had become an old problem about President Kibucky &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — the contents of the report leaked into Kenya , not through the news channels , but in an indirect way , and in your opinion , it really impacted the election .
Julian : Yeah . That became the headline of the Guardian newspaper , and then all the countries surrounded in Kenya were born in the press , in the press of Tanzania and South Africa .
So he came inside through the outside newspaper .
And then , almost two days later , the Kenyan press felt something safe to talk about the report .
And it lasted for 20 days in Kenyan television , not voting 10 percent , depending on the Kini intelligence report , which changed the outcome of the election .
CA : So , your surgical encyclopedia really changed the world ?
Julian : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : Here — we &apos;re going to see a little bit of this video of an airplane hitting tomorrow .
Video is long . But this is a short paragraph .
This is — this is a harsh film material , I &apos;d rather warn you .
Radio — damn , once you put it in your eyes you shoot .
I see your goals , yes , I see four vehicles , in my view ...
They &apos;re in a marshmallow . They &apos;re asleep .
He taught me when they were in your grip . Let &apos;s fire .
I make them all in marshes .
Come on , get up !
( Screaming ) Keep going . Keep going . ( Screaming noise ) It &apos;s going on .
Atwel — Bashchester T-Sx , Bashchester T-Sx .
We have to move . It &apos;s time !
Yeah , we just guaranteed all eight individuals .
We see two planes , we &apos;re still shooting .
Ten . I was able to .
T-SX , this is Tu XX , we &apos;re moving very easily .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What happens ?
Damn it . Yeah , there it is . I got it .
CA : What was the effect of that ?
Julian : The effect of that on people who worked on the video was a painful suffering .
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to study the dimensions of this story .
This seems to be just the first attack of three attacks that happened in this scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 men died in this attack , right , including two Rutgers for the news ?
Julian : Yeah . Two of Rutgers , two of the little kids were wounded .
They were all 18 to 26 people killed together .
CA : And that &apos;s because Deah and mad have explored so many places .
What was the main reason for this that actually caused anger , through your personal opinion ?
Julian : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see the excessive agreement of using power .
You see in the video a group of men walking quiet on the street , and you see helicopter Abrahai hidden in one of the corridors shooting 30 kilograms away on everyone — looking for any justification to do that — and killing people who are saving the neighborhood .
And there were two journalists in the place where they had no suspects because this is their job .
CA : I mean , there was this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested . He was skeptical that he was acknowledged in a cyber chat room that he had leaked you this video , along with 280,000 secret pages of U.S. Embassy .
I mean , did he really do that ?
Julian : We &apos;ve missed those barbs .
He was convicted , about five days ago , with the mission of getting 150,000 barrels and leaking 50 of them .
Now , we published at the beginning of this year a barrel of the US Embassy in Rockjavake , but that &apos;s not necessarily relevant to the situation .
I mean , I was a visitor known for that trap .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve already received thousands of U.S. embassies ...
Julian : We would have published them . ( CA : You would have done that ? ) Julian : Yes . ( CA : Because ? ) Julian : Well , because this kind of thing illustrates what the truth of , say , Arab governments , the actual violations of human rights in those governments is .
If you look at the advertising information , that &apos;s the kind of media that &apos;s there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk more clearly and more public about this .
I mean , generally , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it true that you encourage to leak secret information ?
Julian : Well , there &apos;s a question about what kind of information is important for the world , what kind of information can achieve reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So the information that organizations are doing an economic effort to hide , is really a good sign when information is announced , there &apos;s some hope that they do something good , because institutions that know better , that know that information from inside , are doing a real effort to hide it .
And that &apos;s what we found through experience , and this is the editorial of the press history .
CA : Isn &apos;t there a kind of risk with that , whether for individuals who are interested or actually a society as a whole , where leaking can actually cause unplanned outcomes ?
Julian : We haven &apos;t yet seen anything of that in everything we &apos;ve been given .
I mean , we have a strict immune policy against any damage .
We have a way to deal with information that has the character of a personal function — personal character information that specifies individuals .
But there are secrets that are allowed to — you know , your medical record with your doctor . This is clinically and especially law enforcement , but we &apos;re dealing with people who have to look at some of the problems that have a really good motivation .
CA : I understand that they have a motivation .
And what you would say , for example , you know , somebody &apos;s father — who serves his son in the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve put something that has a sensitivity where somebody else has a precedent incentive to publish this thing to public .
It shows American soldiers laughing at people &apos;s death .
That gives impression — it has given the impression of millions of people around the world that American soldiers are not at the human level .
In fact , they &apos;re not . The parent says , &quot; &quot; My son is not . How do you dare ? &quot; &quot; What do you say as a response to that ?
Julian : Yeah , we &apos;re giving a lot of that .
But remember , people in Baghdad , people in Baghdad , people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see this video : they see it every day .
It &apos;s not going to change anything in their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception of something .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It &apos;s going to change my opinion and the perception of people who are funding all of that , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : There you have found a way to highlight what you see in these kind of fatal secrets in companies and government .
Light is a good thing .
But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order to shine that light , you have to personally create a kind of privacy or secret about your own destiny ?
Julian : Not exactly . I mean , there are no dissidents of WikiLeaks yet .
We don &apos;t have any opposition sources of other sources .
Are they supposed to suggest that , it &apos;s going to be a embarrassing situation for us , but we assume that we &apos;re going through a path that people feel morally motivated to continue our mission , not to retreat it .
CA : I &apos;m going to be really impressed , depending on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m looking to see people from the TED audience .
You know , there could be two visions of the Wikipedia and Julian Encyclopedia .
You know , a hero — a hero for all people — that brings them this important light .
Another insight : a serious cause of problems .
Who sees it as a hero ?
Who sees the cause of trouble ?
Julian : Oh , sure . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s not a big crowd , Julian .
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that has never been revealed , but for the first time it was revealed .
I mean , it &apos;s an interesting story that happened recently , right .
What is it ?
Julian : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year — in November last year — there was a series of explosions in Albania like the one that happened in the Gulf of Mexico , but it &apos;s not as big as that in the Gulf of Mexico .
And we received a report — sort of engineering analysis of what happened — they say that , in fact , what happened , a security guard of some competing oil companies actually had , convenient families and they explored it .
And part of the German government had income , in that , and so on ...
And the engineers &apos; report doesn &apos;t have anything in its address , so it was very , very difficult for us .
We couldn &apos;t make sure how healthy it was because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what was going on .
So we were suspicious that maybe a competitive oil company was manipulating or causing a problem .
In the shadow of these circumstances , we put it aside and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The written material looks good , it sounds right , but we can &apos;t make sure of it . &quot; &quot; And then we received the speech of this week from the company that I wrote , you want to track the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; We want to track the source . &quot; &quot; And we were inspiring , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
Which particular document , what are you talking about ?
Can you show us that you have a legal storm in this document ?
Is it really for you ? So they sent us this shot of the screen with the author on the number one page the Microsoft editor program .
Yes .
( Applause ) But it happened a lot though .
This is one of our ways of identifying — to make sure the health of the information , is to try to make this group write letters to us .
CA : Yeah . Do you have information from inside BP ?
Julian : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at this moment , we &apos;re going through special circumstances that are sort of a series of donations and engineering efforts .
So the rate that we published over the last few months has come down a little bit while we &apos;ve been reengineering our internal system to address the super-public opinion demand that we &apos;ve met .
This is a problem .
I mean , like any kind of growth that happens to an emerging organization , we &apos;re in a situation that we didn &apos;t expect for success , and that means we &apos;re adapting a huge number of documents that people are claiming for very high capacity , but we actually don &apos;t have enough people to check that information and advertise it .
CA : So that &apos;s a real bottleneck problem , basically volunteer journalists and / or funding the order of these journalists ?
Julian : Yeah . And people are trusted .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very difficult to grow quickly because of the kind of material that we &apos;re dealing with and presenting , so we have to modify the way we work if we want sample people who are going to deal with secrets at the top of national security , with lower security conditions .
CA : So help us alone to understand your personality and how I got to do this .
And I think I read that when I was a kid , I went to 37 different schools .
Could that be true ?
Julian : Well , my father was working in the cinema business and then the distance from a certain director , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , Dr. myself can say that that &apos;s a way to build a Baranoia .
Julian : What , cinema work ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were a computer hacker when you were young and you were caught by authorities early on .
Julian : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist at the beginning of my life .
I wrote a magazine , and I had some problems when I was a teenager .
So it has to be very careful with computer hackers .
I mean , like — there &apos;s a way that can be used or organized for many things .
Unfortunately , now , it &apos;s often used by Russian mafia to steal your grandmother &apos;s accounts in the bank .
This expression of &quot; &quot; The Incredible &quot; &quot; is not — as cute as it was in the past .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing the calculation of anybody &apos;s grandmother , but what about the essence of your belief in principles ?
Could it give us an idea of these values and maybe some attitudes in your life that had an impact on those values ?
Julian : I don &apos;t remember any of the attitudes .
But the fundamental values : Well , old men who have special abilities don &apos;t make victims : they care for the victims .
And this is something from my father and something else from men as men who were able to have an impact in my life .
CA : Well , old men who have special abilities don &apos;t make victims : they take care of the victims .
Julian : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a struggle person , so I &apos;m not kind of a big part of the care side , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to care for victims , which is to track the crimes of those crimes .
And that &apos;s something that was in my personality for a long time .
CA : Tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : What happened in Iceland ?
I published something in the press there , which caused a problem with one bank , and then the press council there was something about blocking that story or news .
Instead of spreading your story .
The thing that made you famous in Iceland . What happened next ?
Julian : That &apos;s a big story , you know .
Iceland went through this economic adversity .
It was the hardest and most devastating crisis of any country in the world .
Their financial sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy as a whole .
Anyway , we published this report in July last year .
The national television was wasted five minutes before the start of broadcast on the air . Just like in the movies , the judicial warning came to the news room , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well , let &apos;s show our website instead , all the time of the day , as an alternative , and we became very famous in Iceland , I went to Iceland and and talked about this problem .
And there was a sense in society that this must never happen again , and as a result , working with some politicians in Iceland and and some international law experts , and we put a new kind of legislation in Iceland to become the safe haven of free press , with the most powerful laws of press protection in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for free press and expression .
Iceland is a dynamic country , it &apos;s like Norway , it can interfere in the system .
About a month ago , it was passed and attached by a consensus council .
CA : Oh .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
When you think about the future , do you think it &apos;s going to be more like a dominant and controlled Big Brother , or are we going to see bigger brother or that play is going to be both directions ?
Julian : I &apos;m not sure how things will go .
I mean , there &apos;s a huge pressure for the regulations of free speech legislation in journalism and transparency legislation around the world — within the European Union , between China and the United States .
Which way is it going to be ? It &apos;s hard to know .
That &apos;s why this time is so exciting to be in , because a little bit of effort we can change it in any direction or another we want .
CA : Well , I seem to reflect the audience &apos;s opinion to say be Julian warning and wish you all to agree .
Julian : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel very lucky to be coming from a country that is considered , in general , the best place in the world as a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland did a strike .
They didn &apos;t do their work that day , whether they were professional work or house work .
Take a walk to the middle of Riverside — 90 percent of women participated — and peacefully , including the Taliban for equality .
That day , nothing worked in Iceland , because when women were abused from work , nothing worked .
( Applause ) Five years later , Icelandians had the courage to become the first country in the world that elected in a democratic way a woman to take the president .
I will never forget that day , when President Vegas , we knew her first name , she went out to her hometown , or one mother standing next to her daughter after her wedding .
( Applause ) This woman was a great role for me and for everyone who grew up at the time , including boys .
She was often hesitating the story of the boy I was accepting after spending two addictions in the presidency and asked her , &quot; &quot; Is it really possible that boys can grow up to be presidents ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The tools have a huge impact , but even with those strong models that I feel grateful for , when I encouraged to get into presidential elections , my first reaction was , &quot; Who am I for the presidency ? &quot;
Who am I to become a president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to run than men .
A study in the United States in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men thought about running for office , while only 45 percent of women thought about it .
That &apos;s a 16 percent difference , and it &apos;s the same difference as a decade ago .
And it &apos;s really a shame , because I believe strongly that the world needs a desperate need for leaders and to lead more dependent on principles in general .
My decision to explain was ultimately because I felt that I had to contribute to my role , even if I didn &apos;t have a political experience , move forward and try to be part of the shape of the world that would be understandable and sustainable for our children , a world where we actually allow our children and our children to become what they wanted to be .
And this was my journey of life .
It was fantastic .
The journey started about two candidates .
And then the number became nine qualified candidates , and the race ended with four of us , three men and I .
( Applause ) But the drama is not over yet .
You think you have drama in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can assure you that we have our own drama in Iceland .
Our head of law enforcement 20 years ago declared at the beginning that he would not run for president , and that often made a lot of candidates think about running for president .
And then he rejected his opinion after he resigned the Prime Minister on the impact of the Panama Papers that he and his family were involved in .
And there was a known phenomenon in Iceland , and the president thought they needed a trusted leader .
A few days later , his wife &apos;s relationships and private companies discovered their family in the Panama Papers , and he pulled out of the race again .
And before he did that , he said he withdraws because now there are two qualified men who feel they can solve him in the presidential election .
On May 9th , 45 days before the election day , things didn &apos;t look good to me .
I didn &apos;t even show the graph in the newspaper .
She got one percent in opinion polls , but that was the highest percentage you get for any woman she declared to release .
So it would be like abuse if I said I had to do a hard job to get a seat at the table , and I could get to TV , because the TV networks decided they were going to add only 2.5 percent or more in the opinion polls in the first TV .
I discovered on the afternoon on the first day of the TV that I was going to share with the three men , and I found in the TV broadcast that I had reached 2.5 percent right in the first day of the debate .
( Applause ) So , the challenges .
The fundamental challenges I had to face and overcome in this journey had to do with media and power and money .
Let &apos;s start with the media .
There are people who say that gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I can &apos;t say I &apos;m OK .
It was hard to get to the media and get time to broadcast the neighborhood .
As a fact , the progressive candidate appeared in the broadcast media 87 times in the previous months of the election , whereas I had 31 times appeared .
And I &apos;m not saying that media does this intentionally .
I think this bias often happens ironically , because in the media , as it is in many areas , we have the emotional and insensitive bias , and we need to have the courage to talk about if we want to change it .
When I finally got to show up on TV , the first question that came to me was , &quot; &quot; Do you sleep out ? &quot; &quot; And that was a tough question .
But of course , with one percent to 2.5 percent in opinion polls , that might be understandable .
But the media is really important , and every time it appeared on television , we saw a rise in opinion polls , I know firsthand how important it is and why we should talk about it .
I was the only one of the four final candidates that had no conversation on the front page .
I was sometimes excluded from questions that were headed to other candidates and raised by electoral coverage .
So I actually faced this , but I would say that to the Icelandic media agenda .
I had very few comments on my hair and my suit .
( Applause ) So I tell them , &quot; Well done . &quot;
But there &apos;s another very important experiment .
I filmed as an independent candidate , I didn &apos;t belong to any political party and I didn &apos;t have any power .
Not experience and not access to resources might cost us a lot in our campaign , but it gives us the opportunity to innovate and work in politics differently .
We were leading a positive election campaign , and maybe for others we &apos;ve changed the way elections do this .
Maybe it &apos;s why I didn &apos;t show up on TV enough because I wanted to be respected for the rest of the competitors .
When it turns out that access to media is something at the end of the difficulty , we created our own media .
I &apos;ve been conducting sessions on Facebook where I get questions about anything from the voters and answer them immediately .
And we were putting all the questions and answers to Facebook open because we see transparency is important if you want to build trust .
And when the access to young voters was a big challenge , I became used for passengers .
I took young people to teach me how to use it , and I used every filter in the Chechnya script in the last part of the campaign .
And I really had to use a lot of humor and joke even though I was very bad at them .
But the percentage of our youth followers has increased with doing that .
So we can do a different election campaign .
But unfortunately , you can &apos;t talk about politics without talking about money .
I feel sad about it , but it &apos;s true , and we have less financial resources than other candidates .
Maybe that was a little bit because I found it difficult for my students to support money .
And maybe I had the ambition to do a lot with a little bit .
Some people might say this is a very feminine part of me .
But despite only a third of the media and financial resources have transferred , and only a organizational team , but it &apos;s great , we were able to surprise everyone on election night , when the first numbers came .
And I was surprised , as you can see in the picture .
( Laughter ) In the early numbers , I came along with the advanced candidate .
( Cheers ) Well , that &apos;s early because I &apos;ve never done that , but I &apos;ve got one tenth of a second , and we &apos;ve got one percent of a big difference , roughly a third of the sounds , and we &apos;ve outperformed opinion surveys with unprecedented margins , by increasing 10 percent of the latest opinion survey .
Some people say I &apos;m the real winner of elections because of that , and a lot of people encourage me to get elections again .
But what really makes me feel proud is that I know I &apos;ve got a relatively high percentage of young people , and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to have a 2040 election .
( Applause ) It &apos;s 13 , and it &apos;s never been on television .
And on election day I saw her on TV more than once , and she was smart and confident of herself , and she was honest and supportive for her mother .
Maybe this was the most significant thing in my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was something else .
These are pre-school girls walking down the street , and they find a poster on it in the parking lot , and where they need to accept it .
Audience : Wow !
This picture was like winning for me .
What we see , we can achieve it .
Let &apos;s overcome fears and challenges .
( Applause ) It &apos;s important to encourage women , and it &apos;s time to imitate the right women , whether it &apos;s the CEO or the head of the state .
And she also succeeded in leaving a impression in your health : THE , NEL , YORKER , I got a new heart , &quot; &quot; the living expressive symbol of honesty . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) It might be more fearful to him so far , because often women are punished to use what I call an emotional career , but I knew by the experience that we &apos;re getting good at doing it .
( Applause ) And we want more .
We celebrated the night of elections as if we had won , because that &apos;s what we felt .
So you don &apos;t have to get there .
You just have to try to reach it , you , your family , your friends and everyone who works with you , and if you do it on the full face , you get to the subjects you &apos;ve never been to before .
We &apos;ve spent a lot of time , and I &apos;ve learned a lot about this journey , many lessons that I might share with you in the time that I have today .
But make sure it was hard work .
I had a lot of sleep all those months .
It requires not to withdraw a lot of resilience and perseverance , but I &apos;ve learned something that I &apos;ve known one day in one percent , which is that you &apos;re only good when you listen honestly and asymmetrically to your voice and work according to that .
And as you sometimes say , a dear sister for me , you can trick your intuition , but your intuition can &apos;t hide you .
And I also think it &apos;s very important , and you all know this , that any journey you &apos;re going to take , depends on the team that you agree with .
They depend on people next to you sharing the same values and vision , but they &apos;re different in anything else .
This is a success equation for me , and I &apos;m fortunate to have a wonderful husband , who &apos;s here today , an amazing family — ( Applause ) and wonderful friends , and we &apos;ve worked with each other in the politics square , and we &apos;ve harvested something that everybody said was impossible .
In fact , the PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would get seven percent at best .
I respected his vision because maybe he was right and it was based on a valuable experience .
But on one percent day , her day decided to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s very important to mention this , because I was honored to sleep a lot , and I worked hard , me and with me .
We cannot continue if we forgot to take care of ourselves .
And there are two things that have to do with that that I think are very important , to surround yourself with people and practices that make you thrive , but equally important , even more importantly , if you have the courage to get rid of the people and practices that absorb your energy , including wonderful bloggers and hackers .
I got a lot of other people to do that , and I made a decision to go up when other people smoke , and that &apos;s sort of what made me be able to preserve my energy all the time .
And when I was losing my energy for a moment — and this was happening from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I was back to the idea of why I decided to run , and how I decided to go into my race .
I called it the 4G campaign , the letters of G represent Icelandic words .
And the first word is Gagn . I explained to do what &apos;s good , to provide a service , and I wanted the service to be at the center of my work , and who works with me in the campaign .
The second word is Gleilei or pleasure .
I decided to enjoy the journey .
There was so much we could get out of the journey whether we could get to the point we needed or not .
And I tried as far as I could inspire others to do this as well .
The third word is Gagnsi , I was ready to get any question .
I didn &apos;t have any secret , and everything was available on Facebook and websites .
Because I think if you &apos;re going to pick your boss , you &apos;re worth getting answers to your questions .
And lastly , not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ran under the concept of the Girl Power .
( Cheers ) I &apos;m very happy to have the courage to run , to risk failure , but I get the success at multiple levels .
I can &apos;t say it was easy , but I can say , and I think my whole team would agree with me , she was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I haven &apos;t allowed you to go yet . Can you do it ? ( Laughter ) PM : What a wonderful assembly . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying .
That maybe everyone in this room is willing to go to Iceland and and vote for you .
But of course we can &apos;t vote there , but there &apos;s one thing we can take from Iceland and and we &apos;ve always taken that inspiration .
I mean , as old as I could remember in 1975 when all Iceland women were striking , and this was really a big business to support the movement of women .
I &apos;d mentioned that in the beginning , and I &apos;d like to take the picture back and just remember what the country looked like when it was in complete stop .
And what you probably don &apos;t know , because our American media didn &apos;t move on , Icelandic women got the last Monday strike , right ?
Hello Tomsdwarter : Pat Mitchell : Can you tell us about it ?
Ha Tomsdwarter : Yeah , after 41 years of authentic strike , maybe we &apos;re the best place in the world to be women , but we haven &apos;t finished our work yet .
So at 2 : 38 p.m. on Monday , Icelandic women left work , because this day was their grip day .
( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about that is to share young men and females with more numbers than ever before , because it &apos;s time for us to close the gap between nations .
PM : I &apos;m not going to ask for a second to commit what you &apos;re going to do next , but I &apos;m going to say you &apos;re going to have a large army of volunteers if you want to do it again .
Thank you very much .
HW : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve been thinking about my career since I left the White House , and it &apos;s going to bring me a great example , which is a cartoon in New York magazine two years ago .
And the boy was looking at his father admire and saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I grow up , I want to be the former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In fact , it was a big benefit for me to work president because I had access to a lot of places that only a few people in this world had and recognize a lot of people in this big world .
And I &apos;m not only aware of 50 states in America , but my wife and I visited over 145 countries in this world , and Karter had programs in over 80 countries around the world .
And often when we were visiting a country , we were not only visiting presidents and attitudes , but we were meeting villagers living in the remote areas of Africa .
So our commitment to the Carter Center in general was to promote human rights and knowledge of the world as it should and I can tell you transparently that the worst violation in the world of human rights is to violate the rights of women and girls and stranger is not to go too far .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ll start by remembering two reasons for this thing .
First , misunderstood the sacred religious scripts such as the Bible , the new , new era and the Koran , and this misinterpretation by men controlled by temple and churches and mosques .
And they interpret these instructions so that they make a woman in a normal second position compared to men through a religious view .
This is a serious problem that has not been adapted enough .
Several years ago , in the year 2000 , I had worked my own supporter for 70 years in the South Academy Church , and I &apos;d like to tell you that I still know every day , and I &apos;m going to teach the next Sunday too , but the conference of Southern Independent Church decided in 2000 , that women had to play secondary roles compared to men .
And they made a decision , preventing women to become a priest in the church or even in the army , and if a woman learns in a classroom there in a school class there in a church education center , she doesn &apos;t have education if there &apos;s a boy in the class , because you find a mirror in the Bible around it . There are more than 3,000 mirrors about that in the Bible , saying that women don &apos;t have to teach men and so on .
But the fundamental problem is misunderstanding religious scripts , to keep men in a higher position .
And this is a really big problem , because men can use power in that , and if a man or a businessman wants to cheat a woman , for example , they will say that if a woman doesn &apos;t have to fit in to the man at God , why do we treat it ?
Why do we pay women the same pay for the same work ?
And the most dangerous case here that this problem has caused is to go to violence increasingly , and this is rising terribly around the world .
In the United States , for example , there was a huge increase in exploiting the poor , especially black and minorities by putting them in jail .
And when I was in the court of Georgia , there was one in a thousand Americans in prison .
But today we have 7.3 thousand in prison .
That &apos;s a seven-fold increase .
Since I left the White House , we &apos;ve had 800 percent increase in prisoners from black women .
We also have a country of very few countries in the world the death penalty in this developed country .
And we fall between the most countries in violating human rights in all the criteria in terms of encouraging the death penalty .
We &apos;re still in California now , and it &apos;s been discovered very recently that California spent four billion dollars judging 13 people with death penalty .
If you calculate that , California costs 307 million dollars in order to implement a democratization in one person &apos;s right .
And the state of Princia has issued a law to abandon the death penalty this week , because it &apos;s very expensive . ( Applause ) So asylum to violence and exploitation of poor and vulnerable is another reason to exploit women .
Let me just show you some of the kinds of exploitation that really concerns me , and I &apos;m going to try to summarize that because of the time narrow , you know .
First of all , the genital organs of the females or the whales .
The beetle is horrible , but it &apos;s not known for women in the United States , but in many countries , at the very first stage of the age of girls , they do their beekeepers with what &apos;s called a sharp cross , conducted with a sharp code and then undocumented , they remove the outer parts of the genital organs of the girl .
And in a few strange cases , they just pick up the vagina hole so that the girl can just pour and the monthly menstruation .
And when you get married , they use the same section to open the vagina so that the girl can have sex .
And that &apos;s not rare though it &apos;s against law in most countries .
In Egypt , for example , 91 percent of the females today are disappeared in the same way .
And in some countries there are more than 98 percent of women , disappeared before they get to adulthood .
It &apos;s really sad , what happens to women in those countries .
Another frightening thing is &quot; &quot; murder the honor . &quot; &quot; And here the family has a misunderstanding of religious texts , where there is nothing in the Koran that is adopted by a girl by her family , whether that girl is raped or married a man without consent and sometimes even getting out with unacceptable clothes .
And this is done by one of her family members , to turn her family into a murder if that girl brought what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; shame &quot; &quot; to her family .
And there was an analysis done in Egypt by the United Nations a little while ago , showing that 75 percent of these deaths of girls had been killed by father or Uncle or brother , but 25 percent of the deaths were killed by women .
Another problem in this world , women are slavery or human trafficking , by new name .
It was sold 12.5 million people in Africa as slaves in the 19th century and 18th century of modern age .
Now there are 30 million people living in slavery .
The U.S. State Department was told by Congress by issuing a annual report on this thing , and the U.S. State Department suggests that 800 thousand people are being sold every year across international borders as slaves , and 80 percent of them are women , for sexual slavery .
And in the United States right now , there are 60,000 people living in slavery .
The state of Atlanta and Georgia , where the Karter Center is located , and where I teach at the University of Emily , there are 200 to 300 women sold to slavery every month .
That makes it the first place in that country .
Atlanta has the most crowded airport in the world , and many passengers come from the southern hemisphere .
And if the owner wanted to buy a girl with a yellow skin , it could be 1,000 dollars .
And for the girl with white skin , it costs more than twice , and the prostitution owner in Atlanta in the United States today , can make 35,000 dollars in every slavery case .
Sex business in Haiti is Atlanta and Georgia is outperforming the entire drug trade in them .
So this is another serious problem and the fundamental problem is prostitution , where there is no prosecutors in America that local officials don &apos;t know , local police , police leaders , conservatives and others .
And this leads us to the worst problem , is that women are buying and growing sexual slavery all over the world .
Sweden has a good trend to that .
About 15 to 20 years ago Sweden changed the law , and women were no longer judged if they were in sexual slavery , but the house of prostitution and contractors and customers of men were being prosecuted , ( Applause ) The percentage of prostitution dropped .
In the United States we have the opposite to that .
Every man is arrested illegally , there are 25 women arrested .
Canada , Ireland , and I mentioned Sweden earlier , and France and other countries are planning to the Swedish model .
This is another thing that can be done .
We have two great institutions in our country that everybody respects : the military and the wonderful university system .
In the military they analyze how much sexual assault happened .
And the last report I got , 26,000 sexual assault was mentioned by the military , 6,000 !
Only 300,000 , that &apos;s not so much , more than one percent control actually , and the reason is that the SARS officer in any institution , for example , a ship or a library in the army or a Marine Corporation , the officer who has a legal right to decide the ruling court from their enemy , and of course , the last thing they want is that people know how sexual assault has happened under their mission , they &apos;re not going to court .
So that law has to change .
One of four girls entering American universities has been sexually abused before graduation , and this has become tremendously known now , because of my relatively book and because of other things , 89 universities in America have been performed by the Ministry of Education under the IX Law because the officials at universities don &apos;t care about women , in order to protect them from sexual assault .
And the Ministry of Justice says that more than half of the cases of rape in the campus are being jailed by law offshore , if they &apos;re raped by someone who &apos;s going to trial them , but in the campus there &apos;s a rapist immunity .
And nobody &apos;s going to do their trial .
This is what happens inside our society .
Another very dangerous thing about exploiting women is a reduction of rewarding labor , as you know — ( Applause ) But sometimes there &apos;s a misconception , and working full-time , women in the United States get 23 percent less than men .
When I was a president , the difference was 39 percent .
So we made a partial progress when I was president . ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) In the last 15 years there was no progress , it was about 23 percent or 24 percent in the last 15 years .
This is what happens .
If you take the example of the 500 richest companies , 23 of them have women &apos;s CEO , from 500 companies , and I have to teach you that CEOs make less than average than other presidents .
Well , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in our country .
Another problem in the United States , is that we are the most war in the world .
We fought about 25 countries , since World War II .
Sometimes we have soldiers fighting on the ground .
And sometimes you fly over people &apos;s heads and you get bombs on people .
And sometimes we have drones that attack people and so on .
We fought about 25 countries or more since World War II .
There was a four-year period that I won &apos;t find , we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) We didn &apos;t take a bomb and we didn &apos;t release a rocket . We didn &apos;t launch one shot .
But asylum to violence is a misunderstanding of religious scripts . That &apos;s the main reason why women and girls exploit .
Another reason , I didn &apos;t mention , is that men don &apos;t care .
( Applause ) That &apos;s the truth .
The average man would say that against discrimination against women , but he was silent and accepted by a good situation , and this is similar to what I knew in my childhood , when he found the apartheid system .
The racial discrimination was found 100 years ago , since 1865 at the end of the Civil War between the United States itself , and even the &apos; 60s , when Lyndon Johnson passed a law project for equality in the rights .
But during that period there were a lot of white people , who didn &apos;t agree with racial discrimination , but they kept silent , because they had great advantages , better jobs , better access to eradication , better schools and everything else . The same thing is there today , because the average man doesn &apos;t care .
Even though they say I &apos;m against discrimination against women , they enjoy high positions .
It &apos;s hard to bring all the men who control the university system , and the majority of men who control the military and the majority of men who control the governments of the world and the majority of men who control the great religion .
So what should we do now ?
I tell you the best thing we can do today is , women in developed countries , like this country , and like your country who have an effect and freedom of expression , they have to hold the stigma on themselves and demand strongly to end discrimination against women and girls all over the world .
The average woman in Egypt can &apos;t defend her daughters to prevent getting two and other things .
I haven &apos;t come back to the details about that .
But I hope that at this conference , to make every woman here realize that these cases of abuse are in the campus and in the military and in the future of work , you have to protect your daughters and grandchildren .
And I have 12 grandchildren and four boys and 10 children of my grandchildren , and I often think about them , and the problem they &apos;re going to face in the future , not just for living in Egypt or a foreign country , in getting equal rights , and I hope you will join me , and be heroes for children and women around the world , and protect their rights as human beings .
Thank you very much .

&quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to dance on your doorstep .
I &apos;m not going to love my body or my soul .
I &apos;m not going to dance to this .
I know that multiplication .
No human .
I know that the skin you hit .
He was alive one day , caught , stole , stretched .
I &apos;m not going to dance on your wars &apos; drum .
I &apos;m not going to sing . I &apos;m going to smash for you .
I &apos;m not going to hate you . I &apos;m not going to hate you .
I &apos;m not going to kill you .
And of course I &apos;m not going to die for you .
I &apos;m not going to kill , I &apos;m not going to be suicide .
I &apos;m not going to stand in front of you , and I &apos;m not going to dance with the bombs , because everyone wants to dance .
Everybody can be wrong .
Life is right . It &apos;s not cumulative , it &apos;s not accidental .
I &apos;m not going to forget where I came from .
I &apos;m going to make my own thesis .
I &apos;m going to put my shoes in my heart , and we &apos;re going to dance in our humanity .
If our blood is going to be a song we dance on .
I &apos;m not going to allow you to manipulate me .
I &apos;m not going to mention my name , or my voice , for you to kill .
I &apos;m going to dance , I suppose , dance , pretend , dance .
My heart rate fell larger than death .
The low-sound war drums are less scared than the whisper whisper , huh .
How are you members of TED ? Let me hear your voice .
( Applause ) Peace Salaam .
Ah , Joshua , inspiration , peacekeepers .
I know .
I was very wrong .
Really much .
And I didn &apos;t know what to read to you today .
I mean , I was preparing myself .
But in fact , I was just preparing my clothes . ( Laughter ) I made choices , and I was collecting the ideas I wanted to ask and the ones I wanted to sing .
Ten is like this .
It brings you . It targets you .
So I &apos;m going to read you a poem that I just chose now .
But I need you to sit down for about 10 minutes and come up with a girl who doesn &apos;t exist here .
Get it right now with you .
You don &apos;t have to tell us her name , just remember her .
Is it there now ?
This is &quot; &quot; broken complexity . &quot; &quot; All sacred history is needed .
Books that didn &apos;t write predictions in the future , I understood the past .
My brain began to see beyond borders and creative human violence .
A product of this ?
Who is the new child ?
Children &apos;s deaths have grown .
It &apos;s more than death .
We love women . It &apos;s complicated .
The air sales beat every day .
Spiders , they come out , the messaging is wasted .
Wars , like brown teeth .
They all disappear after a while .
Don &apos;t look at the ghost that I carry inside me .
I live in circles of light and dark .
The prisoner is half the silence .
I see today , I &apos;ve never been somebody else .
Death , health , violence .
I &apos;m thinking today , I &apos;m not as pure as I think .
Before the form , I was a blind storm , and I am today .
The human being walks the eyes .
I &apos;m not as pure as I think .
Girls are battling . They don &apos;t get mad .
Language can &apos;t express me .
I &apos;ve experienced it over and over again .
Everything . It &apos;s it .
Some women lost 15 , 20 people from their family members .
Some lost six .
Some people lost their heads .
Some are looking at the garbage , some are eating it .
Some are killed at the head , some are killed by their husbands .
Some get rid of their clothes .
Some have children .
Some have cross-borders .
Some have lost the hope to find love .
Some don &apos;t find it .
Where do refugees go ?
How do you break ? You poison how you run out of remote places , and nobody loses it .
It &apos;s like they &apos;re missing .
We love each other &apos;s generation and we love because we don &apos;t mean anything at the end .
We &apos;re in a cycle that looks like a vertical horizon .
Human beings are pushing themselves into the abyss .
The cluster bombs are throwing away .
The landmines grow .
The sadness is spreading .
The crops are filled with papota .
And people harvest bombs where they kill .
They harvest children .
They harvest hand sheets . They harvest smoke .
Truth smoke .
Enter solutions .
The smoke of slavery .
Redemption smoke .
She breathes .
Don &apos;t be afraid of that smoke .
If you want to be afraid , it &apos;s a little bit of a smoke that doesn &apos;t work yet .
Thank you .

When I was a student here in Oxford in the &apos; 70s , the future of the world was a lie .
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was unavoidable .
The epidemic of cancer caused by chemicals in the environment was going to work to shorten our age .
The acid rain was falling on the forest .
The perception was about a mile or two every year .
The oil was on its way to the winter , and a nuclear winter was going to completely kill us .
None of these things happened . ( Laughter ) And in a sudden , I didn &apos;t expect it , if you look at what happened in my life already , per person per normal person worldwide , in the natural conditions , has been modified with inflation rate , and it &apos;s tripled .
Natural life expectancy goes up 30 percent in my life .
Children &apos;s death rate fell by two-thirds .
The rate of food production per capita goes up by a third .
And all of that happened when the population went up to twice .
How did we do that — whether you think that &apos;s good or not ?
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only organisms that have become more fearful even though the population is increasing ?
The unclear area of this graph is the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
I think to answer this question you need to understand how different elements of human beings cooperate in their minds and their ideas can come together again and again and again , and meet and actually be friends .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas can have sex .
I want you to imagine how we could go from producing elements like this to producing things like this .
Each of these things is really real .
One is an iconic pharmaceutical blueprint half a million years ago of the kind made by the first human .
The other is , of course , a computer mouse .
Each of them has the same size and shape that &apos;s kind of hard to describe .
I tried to work out which ones were bigger , and almost impossible to know .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re all designed to fit the size of the human hand .
They &apos;re all technology . In the end , they &apos;re not very interesting .
It &apos;s something to teach us that each of them was designed to fit the human hand .
The differences between them are what excites me , because the ones on the left are made as a beautiful , almost millions of years ago — a million and a half years ago to half a million years ago .
The first man made the same tool for 30,000 generations after him .
Coptical has been some changes , but the tools have changed slowly than the structure of things in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s real .
Whether this device on the right has been used five years later .
There &apos;s another difference as well , which is the tool on the left made out of one material .
The tool on the right is made out of a wonderful combination of different materials , from silicon , metal , plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a wonderful combination of different ideas , the idea of plastics , the idea of lasers , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;re working together in this technology .
And this union , this is multi-technology , motivated me so much , because I think it &apos;s a secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body is the product of a set of ideas as well , the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
Talk together .
How does evolution work on more innovation in the United States together ?
Well , it uses sex for reproduction .
In distant groups of touching , if you put two different recipes of different organisms , one green and one red one , one must be better than the other .
One will be extinct to live the other .
But if we could make a mating of groups , then maybe one of them would inherit all the changes that occur from different relatives .
So what sex does is it enables one to rely on genetic innovations for all kinds of groups .
It &apos;s not a single atom .
What are the same steps that produce the same effect in urban evolution as the role of sex in biological evolution ?
And I think the answer is exchange , usually exchange something against something else known .
It &apos;s a unique human advantage .
No animal can do it .
You can teach them in the lab simple examples of exchange , and there &apos;s real support between animals together , but exchange for one component of something else never happened .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; Never happened that somebody saw a dog doing a fair exchange for a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You could have a culture without exchange .
You can , as it was , just a mental civilization .
The chimpanzees , the big dolphins , these kinds of organisms have their own culture .
They know each one of them the other traditions from parents to small animals .
In this case , chimpanzees &apos; families learn each other how to drop trees in rocks .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , don &apos;t grow up , they didn &apos;t accumulate , and the reason is because there &apos;s no gender , as it was , there &apos;s no exchange for ideas .
The chimpanzees &apos; groups have different cultures with different groups .
There &apos;s no exchange for ideas among them .
And why does exchange cause living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
And here &apos;s a stone model of this story , although it &apos;s meant in commercial exchange images among countries .
It took Adam four hours to make a drawing and three hours to make a plan .
He took one hour to make two hours to make a plan .
So he won better than Adam in the work of kindergarten and duck .
It doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own symbol and his own authority .
Well it &apos;s not , because if you think about it , if you make wins and Adam made two plans , and then after that , each of them would save an hour of work .
And the more they do that , the more they get better , because the more they do it , the better Adam quality improves in the crystal work , and also wins it will become better at the surgeon &apos;s work .
So the trade exchange between them is going to increase .
And this is one of the features of trade , it actually creates a kind of more evolution of specialization , which in turn creates an increase in development in trade and so on .
Everybody from Adam and Avaz and they saved an hour of time .
That &apos;s a lung , saving time against your needs .
Ask yourself how long you have to work to have yourself a enough firefight for an hour reading this evening reading a book .
If you had to start from the beginning , you &apos;d be out of the countryside .
You find sheep . You kill it . You take fat from it .
You treat it special processing . You can make a candle , etc .
How long do you have to do that ? Some time .
How much time do you actually have to work to receive an hour of reading if you win an average income in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
In the past 1950 , it had to work for eight seconds of average income to receive the fire .
And there are seven and a half seconds of lung that you won . Since 1950 , as it was , because that seven and a half seconds you &apos;ve invested in doing something else , or you can make another commodity or service .
In 1880 , it would cost 15 minutes to win this ratio of average income .
In 1800 , it had to work six hours to earn the equivalent of a candle that could burn for an hour .
In other words , the average person in the normal income would not have a candle in 1800 .
Back to this picture of the cat and the mouse , and ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who made them and for whom ? &quot; &quot; The stone crystal was made by somebody to themselves .
It was self-sufficient .
We call it poverty these days .
But the element on the right is made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Hundreds ?
You know , I think probably millions .
Because we have to consider the person who planted coffee , who was made for the person who was working in the oil field , who was extract oil , who was going to be made to plastic , and so on .
They were all working for me , to make a computer mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how society works .
That &apos;s what we achieved as groups of one species .
In the old days , if you &apos;re rich , there were actually people working for you .
That &apos;s what it means to be rich ; you hire them .
There were a lot of people working for Lewis 14 .
They &apos;re the ones who knit his strange clothes , they look like this . ( Laughter ) And they &apos;re also the ones who cut his ridiculous hair like this , and so on .
He had 498 people who had dinner every night .
But the contemporary tourist who visites the Palestinian palace in France and looks at pictures of Lewis 14 , also has 498 people who are a slave at night .
They &apos;re in bars , coffee , restaurants and stores all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you in the reserve hour with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably going to be more quality than the 14th Louis service .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
We &apos;re all able to rely on specialization and exchange to lift the living standards of all of us .
Now , you get the animal business theory for each other .
Ants are a traditional example : workers working for queens and queens working for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , where it &apos;s only happening in the colony .
There &apos;s no mutual work for others across colonies .
And the reason for that is that there &apos;s a production divide to work .
This is to say , they &apos;re specialized in their preparation for reproduction .
The queen works all the work .
In our species , we don &apos;t like to do that .
The only thing we insist on doing ourselves is reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave the answers to the queen .
( Applause ) So when did this norm start ?
And how long are we still doing that ? What does that mean ?
Well , I think , potentially , the oldest version of that is , I think , the sexual divide of action .
But I have no evidence for that .
It just looks like for the first time we did that was a male job for a female and a male .
In all societies today , we find hunter-gatherers and universities , there &apos;s a divide to work towards the performers , in total , male , clinic and female .
Not always that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between male and female specialization rules .
And the beauty of this system is it benefits both sides .
Women know in the case of Hadza here — an inherent root to share men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she needs to have is a source of protein to look for some seeds and exchange them with meat .
And she doesn &apos;t have to go in a teenager fishing and try to kill Wardsburg .
And the guy knows he doesn &apos;t have to make any drill to get seeds .
All he has to make sure that when a pig is killed , it &apos;s big enough to share .
So each of these sides increases the quality of life on the sexual divide of work .
When did that happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that the Neanderthals didn &apos;t .
They were highly cooperation groups .
They were very smart .
Their brains on average , generally bigger than your brain and brain in this room today .
They were pretty good at imagining and innovating . They were burning their dead .
They probably had a special language , because we know they had FOXP2 of the same kind that we have , which was revealed here in Oxford .
They seem to have language skills .
They were very smart . I don &apos;t underestimate the Nanderthal groups .
But there is no evidence of a sexual divide of action .
There is no evidence of aggregating behavior by females .
The females seem to be cooperative hunters with men .
And the other thing is that there &apos;s no evidence that there &apos;s no exchange between their group , because the elements that are in the Nanderthal groups remain , the tools they made , are always made out of local materials .
For example : in the Caucasus there &apos;s a place where you can find primitive tools made for these groups .
They &apos;ve always used local stone materials .
In the same valley there are modern human elements that have lived for about the same history , 30,000 years ago , and some of those tools from the local Soon , but more — a lot of these tools have been made out of Craig for a long time .
And when humans started moving things in different places like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging their elements between their group .
Trade trade volume is 10 times the size of agriculture .
People forget that . People think about exchange as if it &apos;s a modern thing .
The exchange between tribal groups has happened hundreds of thousands of years ago .
And a recent proof of that appeared almost 80 to 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see the snow and the Jabbar and other things moving great distances in Ethiopia .
You also see the sea floor — as it was discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving inside 125 miles of the Mediterranean Mediterranean in Algeria .
And this is evidence that people are starting to exchange between groups .
And that will lead us to specialization .
How do you know that that movement for a long distance means commercial exchange as well as immigration ?
Well , if you look at the recent fisheries committees of the Borgigal , who were motivated to extract grain stones in a place called the Asian Mountains , which was the king mine of the Cambodian tribes .
They &apos;re entering them with their neighbors with things like a kind of nine fish , and the result of that was that these stone axes ended up in a big part of Australia .
So the long-distance movement of tools is a sign of commercial exchange and not for immigration .
What happens when people stop trading , from being able to exchange and personalize ?
And the answer is , not only do you slow down the movement of technological progress , you can actually push it backwards .
Tasmania is an example .
When sea level went up , Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , people living in it , not only did they see slow progression of the rest of the people on the main island , but they actually saw a decline in all areas .
They lost their ability to make some tools out of bone and fishing tools and clothing manufacturers because about 4,000 people were not enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to preserve the technology they were using .
It &apos;s as if people in this room were confined on a desert island .
How many things in our pockets make us continue to make 10,000 years later ?
It didn &apos;t happen in Terra Daju — a similar island , and people like that .
The reason is , because Terra Daju was separate from South America in a very narrow way , Argentina now , and there was commercial exchange across this parallel for 10,000 years .
While people on the island of Tasmania were isolated .
Go back to this picture and ask yourself , not just for making it and for it , but who knows how to do it .
In the case of the stone duck , the man who made it knew how to make it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
Nobody on the planet knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean , that &apos;s seriously .
The head of a computer mouse doesn &apos;t know how .
He just knows how to run a company .
The person who works on the production line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to treat oil well to get the oil out to make plastic , and so on .
We all know a little , but none of us know everything .
I &apos;m , of course , quoted by a famous article by Leonard Reed , the economist in the &apos; 50s , expressing &quot; &quot; I , a pencil . &quot; &quot; In what he wrote about how he made pencil , and how no one knew how to make a pen , because the people who work on making it don &apos;t know how to put it together with carbon , and they don &apos;t know how to cut and those other businesses .
And what we did in the humanitarian community , during commercial exchange and personalization , is we created the ability to do things that we didn &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
With language , we have to transform the ideas that we understand with each other .
But with technology , we can do things beyond our ability .
We &apos;ve been able to extend the capacity of the human mind to a super-awesome level .
And by the way , this is one of the reasons why I &apos;m not interested in controversy about measuring intelligence , whether some groups have higher I.Q. percentage than other groups .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
What it &apos;s about society is how people &apos;s ideas communicate , and how they cooperate well together , and not the skill of the individual from them .
So we created something called the collective mind .
We &apos;re just the projection points on the network .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the exchange of ideas and the way it &apos;s presented , interviews and friendships between ideas , that cause technological advances , over time , something and something .
Even though bad things happen .
And in the future , as we move forward , we will certainly test terrible things .
There will be wars and there will be frustrations , there will be natural disasters .
A terrifying event that will happen in this century , I &apos;m sure .
But I &apos;m also sure , because people communicate together , and the ability of ideas to meet and approach to friendship as never before , I &apos;m sure that technology will move forward , and according to that quality of life will move forward .
Because through computing , through crowdsourcing energy , from the smallest to the highest peak in this world that we &apos;ve created , where not only the elite , but everyone can create ideas and make them meet and contain , we &apos;re going to get faster than any rate of evolution .
Thank you .

Good evening .
My name is Oldus .
I &apos;m a photographer from Russia .
I started my walk six years ago with a cynical portrait of unfolding many stereotypes of sexual and gender and social issues &#91; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m Russian . I &apos;m selling drugs and gun pornography ! &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Vodka is water ♫ I love Fodka ! &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) — using noise to send a message . &#91; &quot; &quot; You marry me , I need a guide to enter the camera today , I &apos;m still trying to be the fiddler .
I focus on sending meaningful messages , aesthetic , beauty , production and some ridicule and crafting .
Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about my project , which I call miserable romance .
This is my artwork or my paintings inspired by pre-rural English in the mid-19th century .
I take the paintings and give them a new dimension and a contemporary meaning that talks about issues that surround me in Russia , taking pictures of people who are not satisfied but have interesting stories .
This guy is a professional dancer , he &apos;s only 12 years old , but he &apos;s in high school and he &apos;s hiding dancing lessons , and he &apos;s wearing a mask of violence , he &apos;s trying to look the same with his colleagues as a non-personal soldier .
But this boy has goals and dreams , but it &apos;s afraid not to be acceptable in his community , that being different is not easy , especially in Russia .
The next job is a metaphor .
And this is Kenta &apos;s security guard from one of the bars in St. Pittsburgh .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t love me when I &apos;m angry . &quot; &quot; Tell me about a movie of you , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
He scares his sense and his romantic ego , because in Russia , in men , it &apos;s not good to look romantic , but it &apos;s good to surround women and look like this violent epiphany .
( Laughter ) Sometimes in my work , I take the painting and give it a new meaning and a new experience about it .
Sometimes , I want to compare the facial features and play with words : irony , Iron Man , a man who is lying .
( Laughter ) Through the paintings , I transfer the social issues that surround me in Russia to this talk .
An interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18-year-olds are ready and dream about marriage .
We teach from childhood , that successful marriage means successful lives , so most girls fight to get a good husband .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
For the Russian community , I &apos;m a very old , very hopeless service of her marriage .
That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , a wedding dress , desperately in my garden .
But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for their goals and their dreams , and to change those stereotypes .
Be courageous and proud — that helps .
Be comfortable and create some magic .

My name is Amit .
And 18 months ago , I was working another job at Google , and I threw the idea of doing something about art and crafting to my boss at work that actually exists here , and let me do it .
It took me 18 months .
A lot of jokes and fun stories , I can tell you , with 17 interesting artifacts from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the objection .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is simplified on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
I grew up in India .
I got a good education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I couldn &apos;t get to a lot of museums and artworks .
So when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
And working at Google , I &apos;m trying to put this desire to maximize access to technology together .
And so being a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m probably going to start the demonstration and tell you some of the things that we &apos;ve been exposed to since the launch .
So simply : you come to Google.com.
You look around you at these museums here .
We have Uffisi , we have the MoMA , the Herbible age , the Rigos , the last Van to take .
I &apos;m going to actually visit one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
Two ways of getting in — very simple .
Fallow and , bang , there you are inside the museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move around , you spend a lot of time .
You want to move around the museum ?
Open the diagram , and in one pressures , it jumps .
You &apos;re there , and you want to go to the last markets .
Keep going , spend a lot of time .
Exploration .
( Applause ) Thank you . I haven &apos;t got to the best part .
( Laughter ) And so I &apos;m now in front of one of my favorite paintings , the harvest of Peter Brooklyn in the dead .
I see an extra signal here .
If the museum provides the picture , you press it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all the actual data .
And for those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on this — but I &apos;m going to press to stop it right now .
And this is one of the images that we took in what we call the Gabble technology .
So this picture , for example , has about , I think , about 10 billion pixels .
And a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try to show you what you actually get from 10 billion pixels .
You can zoom in very easily .
You see some fun things happening here .
I love this guy ; the expression of his face is unaffordable .
But we really want to go deep .
So I started playing around , and I found something happening there .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Hey , that sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I went inside , and I started to notice that these kids were actually beating something .
I did some research , and I talked to some of my collaborators in dead , and I found that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which includes a stick in the Tuesday morning .
And it seemed to be very popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to go deep , you can actually reach the cracks .
Now just to give you a perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom in , to actually see what you get .
This is where we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best will come soon — so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly go to MoMA , again in New York .
So one of my favorites , the bright night of stars . Now the example I showed you was all about finding the details .
But what if you wanted to see the effects of the brush ?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually produced this museum ?
We zoom in . We actually go inside .
I &apos;m going to one of my favorite parts of the painting , and I &apos;m actually going to get into the cracks .
This is a picture of the starlight night , I think you &apos;ve never seen this before .
I &apos;ll show you my favorite feature .
There &apos;s a lot of other things here , but I don &apos;t have enough time .
This is the really cool part . It &apos;s called groups .
Whatever , any one — no matter whether you &apos;re rich , poor , if you have a luxury house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go ahead and create your own museum on the Internet — create a special group through all the images .
Simply , we go inside — and I &apos;ve created this powerful amplification call — you can just zoom in .
This is the bottom panel , in the National Point .
You can comment things , send them to your friends and start a real conversation about what you feel when you look at this museum .
So I think , briefly , for me , the most important thing is that all the glamorous things here don &apos;t actually come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t come , I think , even from museums .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t say that .
It comes from artists .
And this was my modest experience of this .
I mean , in this digital medium , you can reconsider their actions and show them appropriately on the Internet .
And the biggest question I get right now is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to the museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s about completing the experience .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a storyteller .
This is my work in life , telling stories , writing narratives , and today I &apos;d like to tell you some stories about the art of storytelling , and some of the extraordinary creatures of nature that are called jihad .
But before we get into it , let me show you a glimpse of my personal story .
And of course I &apos;m going to do that with the help of words , and also with the help of a geometric shape , which is the circle . And in my talk , you &apos;re going to have a number of circles .
I was born in Starbourg , in France for Allien Turkey .
And shortly after , my parents broke out , and I came to Turkey with my mother .
Since then , I grew up as a lonely child to a single mother .
And in the early &apos; 70s , in a cow , this was an unfamiliar situation .
And our neighborhood was evaporating the big families , where the parents were the households , and so I grew up seeing my mother as a hero in a paternity environment .
In fact , I grew up watching two different types of women .
On the one hand was my mother , a prominent , educated , secular , modern woman on the West Bank .
On the other hand , my grandmother , who also turned my sponsor , was more spiritual and less culture and less rational pieces .
She was a woman reading the cup to see the future and the bullet melts in strange forms to warm the eye and the body .
A lot of people were reacting to my grandmother , who were claiming youth in their face or breaking evidence on their hands .
And every time , my grandmother was designing in Arabic words , taking a red apple and then cutting it down with a number of flowers that would equal the number of evidence she wanted to take .
And then the chocolate surrounds by circles of dark ink .
And a week later , the patient revisit her to do a follow-up test .
And I realize that I don &apos;t have to mention things like this in front of a crowd of researchers and scientists , and I would say , among all the people who visited my grandmother to treat their serious diseases , I didn &apos;t see one person who had come back and was unpleasant or unhealthy .
I asked her how to do it . Was that the power of prostitution ?
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , the pot is its strength , but you can forget the power of circles . &quot; &quot; And then I learned , in addition to a lot of things , a very valuable lesson : that if you want to destroy something in this life , whether it &apos;s a young grain or a human spirit , all you have to do is surround it with thick walls .
It &apos;s going to melt into it .
We all live inside a kind of cultural circle .
We &apos;re all .
We were born inside a family and a nation and a competition .
But if we don &apos;t have a connection , in any way , with the underlying worlds behind our Muslim world , then we &apos;re also threatened by the dangers of disbelief within the walls .
Our imagination could be shrinking , our hearts would be shrinking , our humanity , if we were to throw the shuttle into our cultural partners .
Our friends , our neighbors , our colleagues , our families , if everyone in our circles were identical to us , that means we &apos;re surrounded by mirrors that reflect our images .
Another thing women like my grandmother in Turkey do is cover mirrors with a canvas , or suspended on the walls and they &apos;re dirty .
And this is from the old East tradition , based on information that benefits as a healthy thing to spend a lot of time reflecting its image .
And ironically , living in societies of that pattern , today is one of the greatest risks facing the world in the age of globalization .
And this is happening everywhere , at liberals and conservatives , atheists and faith , rich , poor , poor , East and West both .
We tend to form compounds that focus on the principle of matching , and then we give stereotypes to other people &apos;s joints .
In my view , one way to overcome these cultural isolations could be achieved through the art of storytelling .
Stories cannot crack boundaries , but they can dig holes in the walls of our minds .
And through those holes , we can capture glimpses of the clouds , and sometimes we like what we see .
I started writing literature at eight years old .
My mother came home with her black-and-white chairs , and asked me if I was interested in the blogging of my day .
And looking forward , I think it was a little bit worried about my mental health .
I was always telling stories at home , which is good , except I was telling them to good friends around me , and that wasn &apos;t a good thing .
I was a fairly introverted kid to communicate with the oppressive coloring and apologizing things when I was hit by them , so my mother thought it would be better for me to perform my everyday experience and my actions .
And what I didn &apos;t know was that I think my life was so bored , and that the last thing I wanted to do was write about myself .
Instead , I started writing about other people , and things that didn &apos;t actually happen .
And then my eternal passion began writing poetic literature .
And so from the beginning , the literature for me was less likely to be a biography of being a journey beyond the range of human experience towards life and other possibilities .
And please bear with me . I &apos;ll take a circle and come back to this point .
Another thing happened during that period .
My mother became a diplomat .
And so from this little neighborhood , the believer in the myths , the middle class developer , where my grandmother was , I quickly moved to that high school in Madrid , where I was the only Turkish student .
And from here I had the first encounter of what I call &quot; &quot; foreign actor . &quot; &quot; In my class , there were children from all sexuality , and yet , this diversity , did not necessarily lead to equal and multiplicity in class democracy .
Instead , creating an environment where every child was perceived , not as an individual independent , but as an actor of something bigger .
We were a little model of the United Nations , which was fun , except in the case of something negative happens , related to nation or religion .
Then the child who represent the ridiculous and accessible and narrow and endless .
And I had to suffer , because during the course of meeting the mosque , there was a military coup in my country , and a soldier tried to wash the door , and Turkey got a zero in the Uruvian competition for the song .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve changed a lot about school and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
And also , the first time I tasted cultural development was there .
The kids were asking me about the &quot; &quot; Midniht Express , &quot; &quot; which I hadn &apos;t seen , and they were wondering how many cigarettes I smoked a day , because they thought all the accumbers were legal smokers , and they wondered what age I was going to start covering my hair .
I found that the primary stereotypes of my country were : politics , cigarettes , veil .
After Spain , we left to Jordan and then Germany and we went back to a cow .
Wherever I went , I felt like my imagination was the only bag I could take with me .
Stories give me a sense of focus and continuity and coherence . Those three things are what was missing me .
In the middle of my 20s , I moved to Istanbul , the city I love .
I was in a diverse and life-beating neighborhood and there I wrote a number of stories .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake happened in 1999 .
When I got out of the building at three o &apos;clock all of a sudden , I got a little bit of a silicon track .
He was a hot man , a mood camp , and he refused to sell wine , and he didn &apos;t talk to the people who were interested .
He sat down to a feminist neighbor wearing a long black pond and a basketball popping over his tent .
I saw the grocery opening up a two-degree cigarette pack and offering a cigarette cigarette , and that picture of the earthquake was preserved in my memory to the day , with a conservative and a Backie speaker sharing smoking on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and destruction , our international bubbles vary and we all become one person even for a few hours .
But I &apos;ve always thought stories have a similar effect on us .
And I &apos;m not saying that novel literature has the same importance of earthquake , but when we read a good novel , we leave our little apartment , the joy behind us , and we walk at night alone , and we start to recognize people we &apos;ve never met , and maybe we &apos;re biased against them .
Shortly after the earthquake happened , I went to college for women in Boston and then in Michigan .
I experienced the experience of transition , not as much as a geographic shift as a linguistic shift .
I started writing literature in English .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , I &apos;m not an immigrant , they asked me why I write in English , but the transition between languages gives me the opportunity to recreate myself .
I love writing in Turkish , and it &apos;s for me very romantic and very emotional , and I also love writing in English , and it &apos;s for me very much computational and very mental .
And that &apos;s what makes me feel connected to both languages differently .
For me and millions of people around the world today , English is a language written .
When you &apos;re a language worker , what happens is you live there and you have a constant and permanent feeling of frustration .
And as a language agenda , we always want to say more , you know , let &apos;s get a little bit more confused , and say better things , but we end up saying a little bit because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
And this gap is pretty exhausting .
But if we can get scared of it , we also find it motivated .
And that &apos;s what I found in Boston — that frustration was very motivating .
At this point in my life , my grandmother , who was tracking the course of my life with an increasing anxiety , included me with her daily inventions and asking me to marry unsolemn , to support stability after my marriage and forever .
And because God loved her , she was married .
( Laughter ) But instead of stability , I moved to Arizona .
And since my husband lives in Istanbul , I began to move between Arizona and Istanbul , and on the Earth , these two particular possibilities can &apos;t be much more different .
I think aside , I hope it &apos;s always been physical , physically and spiritual .
The stories have accompanied me , and I &apos;ve kept my parts and my memories together , as an existential temptation .
And as much as I love stories , I recently started to see that they lose their magic if whenever he looked at it as more than a story .
And this is a topic that I like to hope together .
When I first came out of my first novel in English in America , I heard an interesting comment from a literary critic .
He said , &quot; &quot; I like your book , but I wish he &apos;d written differently .
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by this talk ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at the novel . There are many Spanish and American figures and Spanish assets , but there &apos;s only one subscript in it , and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; And as the narratives fell into the campus of Boston , it was natural for me to be the kind of global characters in which there were more qualitative characters , but I realized what I was looking for .
And I also realized that I would still frustrate his hopes .
He wanted to see a mountain of identity .
He was looking for a prominent woman in the book because I am .
We often talk about how stories have changed the world , but we have to see how the world of identity policy has influenced how stories are published and criticized .
Many authors crawl under the weight of this feeling , but non-Western authors suffer more .
If you &apos;re a woman and a writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you &apos;ll wait to write stories about Muslim women and prefer to be sad stories , for a Muslim woman .
You expect you to write educated stories , influential , diagnostic and leave the experimental and moderate way of your Western colleagues .
What I suffered as a child in that school in Madrid is happening today in the literature world .
The writers are not seen as individual innovators , but as actors of their own civilizations , a few authors from China , a little bit of Turkey , a little bit of Nigeria .
We all thought we had something very special , if not unique .
The writer and the traveler , James Dalin , interviewed him in 1984 , where he asked more than once about his sexual representatives .
When the consultant tried to describe it as a young writer , he stood up in the headlines and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing wrong with me , and there &apos;s nothing in others that doesn &apos;t exist with me . &quot; &quot; When the identity policy tries to impose our officials , our imagination becomes at risk .
There &apos;s a rating of their talent called multicultural polarity literature in which authors are categorized from outside the Western world all under a single web .
I will never forget my multicultural reading at Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
We were three authors , one of the Philippines , Turkish and Indonesia , as a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason we got together was not because we shared art , or literary taste .
It was just because of our passports .
Many multicultural writers are told to tell real stories , not fiction .
The work of storytelling is proportionate to storytelling .
And in this way , not just writers themselves , but also their imaginary personalities become representative of something larger .
But I have to add , to consider a story that is more than just a story of the West .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And that &apos;s what I faced firsthand when I was attacked in 2005 for words in a novel that came to the tongue of one of my random personalities .
I intend to write a constructive and multilayered novel about a man who throws me and a reputation family through the eyes of women .
My little story became a big issue . When I was interviewed .
Some people criticized me , while others guided me to write about the territory conflict — Turkish .
But there were times I wanted to remind both sides that this was imaginary .
It was just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; Just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to minimize my work .
I want to love and celebrate the novel literature of what it is , not as a way of achieving it .
The writers are linked to their political opinions , and there are good political narratives in the literary plaza , but the language of visual literature is not the language of dominant politics .
Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the right way to ask questions are two totally separate things .
The second task is the responsibility of the artist . &quot; &quot; We separate the policy of identity and connect us to literature .
The first one cares about inclusive design .
The second one is interested in subtle differences .
The first one draws boundaries .
The second one doesn &apos;t recognize borders .
Its identity policy is made out of solid bricks .
The literature is from running water .
In the meantime , there were hunter-gatherer storytellers called &quot; &quot; The Glass . &quot; &quot; They were going to the cafe , where they were telling a story in front of an audience of listeners and often improvising .
And with each new person in the story , the &quot; &quot; aspiration &quot; &quot; changed his voice as a master of that character .
Everybody could go to the cafe and listen to my governments , you know , ordinary people , even the authorities , Muslims and non-Muslims .
Stories are all across the border , like &quot; &quot; The tales of religion shout , &quot; &quot; ( Sounds ) which were common all over the Middle East , and the Southern Africa , and the Balkans and Asia .
Today , stories continue to cross borders .
When Palestinians and Israelis are fighting , they often don &apos;t listen to each other , but the Palestinian reader is still reading a novel to a Jewish author , and vice versa , in relation and empathy with the narrator .
The literature has to move us to the other side .
And if he can &apos;t take us there , he &apos;s not good literature .
The books rescued that introverted child , the tour I had previously been .
But I realize the danger of writing it .
When the Roman religion was met with the twins of his spirit , the shaman of the justification religion , the first thing he did was he threw a Roman book in the water and sat down watching the letters vanished .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The science that doesn &apos;t take you far from yourself is worse science than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem of today &apos;s isolated cultures is not lack of knowledge , we know a lot about each other , or that &apos;s what we think but the science that doesn &apos;t make us skip our selves , makes us solemn , far away and confused .
There &apos;s a metaphor I love : &quot; Living like a drawing carpet . &quot;
And you know , one of the legs of the rock is static and stolen at some point .
The other leg is constantly rotating to draw a broad circle .
And so are my stories .
A constant part of Istanbul with root roots , and the other part is all over the world , associated with different cultures .
And from this stage , I like to consider my local and global narratives at the same time , from here and from everywhere .
Those of you who have ever visited Istanbul may have seen the high door cabin , which was the place of the Greek Islamists for over 400 years .
In the palace , right outside the Fortune Republic , there &apos;s a space called the Gene Collaboratory .
They fall between buildings .
This idea enables me .
We often get rid of those broken spaces between things .
And we look at it as the bias of the supernatural creatures like the embryo , the creature of a fire to enter into it as a symbol of a mirror .
And what I want to get to is that that surrounding space may be the most important thing that the book and the artists need .
When I start writing a novel , I have to do with language and the ability to change .
I &apos;d better not know what &apos;s going to happen in the next 10 pages .
I like to be surprised by my personality .
Maybe I &apos;m going to write about a Muslim woman in one of my novels and maybe it &apos;s going to be a very happy story , and in my next novel , maybe I &apos;m going to write about a university professor from Norway , and Sam and Sheaven .
As long as our hearts are our sources , we can write about anything and everything .
Odysseus Lord once said , &quot; &quot; We taught white parents to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , therefore I exist . &quot; &quot; And she was hanging at , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I exist . &quot; &quot; I think it was a great quality shift .
And yet , why today , when we teach creative writing , the first thing we teach students is : write what you know ?
Maybe that &apos;s not the right start .
Philanthropic literature doesn &apos;t necessarily have to write about our universe or our data or what our identity is .
We have to teach ourselves how to extend our hearts and write about what makes us feel .
We have to get out of our cultural isolation and visit the other and then the other .
In closing , stories orchestrate , to draw circles by circles .
Stories are linked to all humans , no matter what their political identity is , and that &apos;s the secret news .
And I &apos;d like to end with this old Summer poem : &quot; &quot; Help on , let &apos;s be friends and if we have a time ; let &apos;s make life walk on us ; let &apos;s love and love for a while ; the Earth won &apos;t be transmitted to a human . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m Jane Mark Jonel . I &apos;m a toy designer .
We &apos;re doing more in the world of games , but I mean .
So far , Worldchanging and Orkfurt put together two groups of five , 93 million years into solving the virtual problems of furniture .
That &apos;s not necessarily bad .
We evolved to become more collaborative and friendly .
And we &apos;re actually building stronger social relationships as a result .
Five million people a month use it .
And that &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
It &apos;s a fantastic job . It &apos;s looking at why .
But it &apos;s not a perfect situation .
We have to start making real life more like a game .
Before we got wonderful games , we had tapirs .
People were struggling . The people were fighting .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
Based on Hirosette , 18 years later , the king decided that they would play a final game .
We want to imagine a mythical win , and then give people the resources to achieve that mythic win .
We made this game in 2007 .
This is a story and an interesting adventure for you .
We have a photographer story . We have development in skills like local understanding , sustainability relationships , vision , intentional .
The dirty jobs crew and I invited us to a small town in Colorado , called Craig .
It &apos;s only a few tens of square miles away , it &apos;s in Rocky Mountains .
And it was working on the farm issue .
And my role in the show for those of you who haven &apos;t looked at it — it &apos;s kind of simple .
I &apos;m a beginner , and I work with people who don &apos;t really have jobs .
And my responsibility is just a commitment and a friendship account of what it looks like to be these people , one day in their lives .
We work for people who demand it — like the songs . Great .
We go to Greg and we fall in a hotel and I realize the next day that statisticians will be a very important part of this work , so .
Usually , I don &apos;t do any research at all .
But , this is a sensitive subject , and I work at the Discovery Channel , and we want to visualize exactly what we do , and we certainly want to do that with a lot of respect for animals .
So I called the animal companion Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to count some grains , can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes , it &apos;s simple and clear . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a direct way — they basically use rubber tape , like this , but a little bit smaller .
This is actually one about the deck of play that I got yesterday , and there was a kind of intimacy .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The tape applies to the tail , by definition .
And then the last tape is applied to the shipyard bag , very wise .
The blood flows back and down , and a week later the memorable bones are cut .
&quot; Great ! I got it . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m going to call SPCA to emphasize this — they &apos;re pretty sure .
And I also called PETA just for fun and they don &apos;t like it , but they make sure .
Well , that &apos;s basically how we do that .
The second day I came out .
And I gave horses to go and get the horse and take them to the barn that we built , and we walk in business to raise the animal .
Miliani is the wife of Albert .
Albert is the shepherd .
Miliani takes the sheep — her hand — one hand on both his right legs , and the same on the left .
And the load goes to the mail , and it opens it .
Okay . Great .
Albert goes , and I follow Albert , and the crew around me .
I always watch the process of doing it the first time before I try to do it .
Being a coach , you know , you do that .
Albert put his hand in his pocket to pull , you know , to show the black rubber bar but what came out was a knife instead .
And I said this is not a rubber band , you know .
And he had just run out of it and opened it in the way that the sun was just coming out of the rocket — it was — it was fantastic .
In space in about two seconds , Albert held the knife between the tail cartilage , next to the back of the tail , and very quickly the tail went and it was in the blood he held .
In a second of thumb and big sabbatical , they got very well , and he had a shipyard bag , holding it with a pack in his throat .
And he pulls it towards him , and then he takes the knife and puts it on the end .
Now you think you know what &apos;s going to happen , Michael , you don &apos;t know ? Okay .
He grabs that , puts it on the edge of his shoulder , and then he grabs the shipyard and pushes it up , and then his head drops up , ignore my perspective , and what I hear is the sound of inspiration , and he spreads the noise that looks like he &apos;s taking off the wall of a fresh and I &apos;m not even kidding .
Can we run the video ?
I &apos;m not kidding — we can &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I think it &apos;s better to talk through images .
So , I do something that I &apos;ve never done before in filming dirty jobs , ever .
I say , &quot; &quot; Hey . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , and we use the first shot , and we don &apos;t use the second shot .
They don &apos;t use writing , they don &apos;t code , and there &apos;s no nonsense .
We &apos;re not fooling around us , we &apos;re not training , we &apos;re screaming and we &apos;re doing photography !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop that crazy . I mean , you know .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s crazy .
And we can &apos;t do this . And Albert said , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s just happened , but there are members of this field that &apos;s not the way we should do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the way we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And let me explain , I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to do that right way , with the rubber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , like the gather .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the pregnancy bleed — we &apos;re in five continents , my owner .
We show twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; He goes into the box and pulls a bag of small rubber bars .
Miliani takes another pregnancy , puts it on the table , and the rubber bond is on the tail , and the second bond is on the shipyard bag .
The sheep is on the ground , and the pregnancy takes two steps , and it falls , wake up , shakes a little bit , takes other steps , and it falls back .
I said , this is not a good indication of this pregnancy at all .
He woke up , walks into the corner and grabs and gets tired of trouble .
And I look at pregnancy and I say , &quot; Albert , how long ? When will it go ? &quot;
When will he fix ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; On a day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; One day ! How long will it take to take ? &quot; &quot; &quot; In a week . &quot;
And during that time , the pregnancy had to do the little procedure is , you know , he jumps , and the fake stopped .
It &apos;s , you know , embraces grass , and it makes a difference .
And I flew away with how I was wrong , at that second .
And I remembered how I was completely wrong , many times .
( Laughter ) And I mentioned especially that the irony is me that day because I had to do what Albert did and there are like 100 of these episodes in the hallway , and suddenly everything started to look like German pornography , and I &apos;m a Millian fan taking the pregnancy , putting it on the table , opening it up .
Albert Le the knife .
Inside and tail comes out .
And I go in again , and I hold the knife of the ships , and he starts to give me a glimpse .
Albert Transferred , &quot; &quot; Get him up . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; I pay more than that . &quot;
I do .
The organs start to emerge and they look like thumbs , coming to you , and they say , &quot; &quot; Put it .
Just muscle . &quot; &quot; And I heard it , and I heard all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how — how did I get here ?
How — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain explodes alone suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Russian Mountains , and all I can think of is Aristotle &apos;s definition of reward .
You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is the moment the hero comes in face with his own identity .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; What is this complex metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t forget the scene and get it out of my eyes , and I did what I had to do .
I went and took them .
I took them like this , and I took my face off again .
And I &apos;m standing there and the two stories are on my ears .
( Laughter ) Now I can &apos;t get it — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
Well , I was still in a poet in Aristotle , and I was thinking — all of a sudden , two collisions came in my head and I hadn &apos;t heard of these phrases since I was studying with my classical teacher and he was flying them in my head .
And they &apos;re anagrams and peripedes , and they have it .
Anagnoris and perpetrators , Intel .
It &apos;s a word from the Greek origin of Angnorisis .
Literally , moving from ignorance to knowledge , anonymous .
What our network does is dirty jobs .
I even live in anguises every single day .
Great .
And the other word is , for perpetus , and this is a moment in the big tragedy , you know — Yerbies and Suffolis — the moment that Odysseus was for his moment , where suddenly he realized that the trap was sleeping with the presence of children with his mother . OK .
This is perpetual and perpetual and perpetual .
And this analogy in my head — I got anagraises and perpetia on my ears .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , this device is great .
When you start looking for Peripeya , you find that everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The sixth sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
The whole film goes on to try to help the little baby who sees two dead people and then boom — oh , I &apos;m dead — for perpetia .
You know ?
It will shock the audience if you know it the right way .
What &apos;s new about Matrix , you know ?
Oh , I live in a computer program — that &apos;s odd .
These discoveries that lead to surprising realization , and they had more than 200 dirty jobs , and they were with me all the time , but these — these discoveries took me away and I was unprepared for them .
And as I stood there , I looked happily at the pregnancy that we just had — but it seemed OK .
Looking at the little thing that I did it the right way , but I was shocked if I was wrong about that whether I was wrong too often , literally , what other misconceptions would I be able to comment on ?
Now look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who works in this field .
And I &apos;m talking to him .
( Laughter ) He says , &quot; &quot; Mike .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this kind of thing or not , do you realize that you &apos;ve photographed the viewer in every country ?
I was working in mining , and I worked in fishing , and I worked hard and I worked in all major industries .
I was standing side by side with these guys that our politicians couldn &apos;t do , and if every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can see Hillary still doing footage of the orphanage and the dynamics under her ear , with the steel workers .
I mean , these are the people I work with every day .
And if you have what you say about their ideas , collectively , it might be time for us to think about it .
Because , folks , you know , four years . You know , in my head , the organs on my ears , and the ideas go around .
And after photography , the dirty jobs didn &apos;t change , in terms of the performance , but they changed to me , personally .
Now , when I talk about the show , and I &apos;m no longer just a novel that you heard 10 times .
But I also begin to talk about some of the other things I &apos;ve got wrong , and some other concepts of work that I just did on a sacred assumption , and it &apos;s no longer .
People with dirty tasks are happier than you think .
As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start changing , &quot; &quot; Look for the name of the Union , &quot; &quot; and on every excitement of a happy worker .
I &apos;m telling you that these people whose work is balanced you can &apos;t imagine .
RoboCapital Pickerboard scream and they work , I swear to God , I worked with them .
I &apos;ve got this kind of amazing symmetry on their lives .
And I see that over and over again .
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these cows .
You follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here in the last 36 hours .
You follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
Maybe the worst advice ever happened .
( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and achieve them , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard when they grow up .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing in my life , but I was told if you were following your passion , it would work .
And I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Kummers , pig pigs in Las Vegas who collects the waste of food from the casinas and gives it to pigs .
Why ? Because there &apos;s a lot of protein in things that we don &apos;t eat and pigs grow at an incredible speed of speed , and it &apos;s a rich pig nurse , and it &apos;s a good thing for the environment , and it spends days with incredible services , and it smells freaky , but God keeps it .
It &apos;s a great living gain .
I ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he will laugh at you .
The guy deserves — he &apos;s got about 60 million dollars for his farm , and he rejected the show — it was out of Las Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He stopped , and he watched the players come out of the front , and then he got his training on the way .
And I hear this story again and again .
Matt Forex , who is a dairy farmer in New Kansas , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized that those of his villages deserve more than her bees , if they can be used to make these purposes of biodegradable flowers .
And now he &apos;s following it to Wal-Mart .
They followed his passion — men — come on .
I started looking at a passion look , and I started looking at the warfare versus the efficiency , as Tim talked about earlier , and that &apos;s the big difference .
I started to look at collective work and design , and basically all of these apples are called the success that &apos;s been consistent with the shield Art all over the world right now .
Those things — all of a sudden they turned upside down .
safety — safety first .
And that is that I &apos;m going to come back to you , you know , the Amman Foundation and Health and Pita , and the animal companion community . What if safety and health are wrong ?
I mean , this is a trick , what am I about to say , but what if safety was really the first one ?
Is that okay ?
( Laughter ) No , I really mean .
What I mean to say is that my safety has more value than these crazy jobs as much as the people I work with , but they &apos;re the ones who do it the right way , they &apos;re not there to talk about safety first .
And they know that other things come first — the achievement of the project comes at first , doing and doing the project .
And I won &apos;t forget , in the Burning Sea , on the boat of the submersible with fishing players , which I work in in the first season .
We &apos;re about 100 kilometers off the coast of Russia and 50 feet to sail , big waves , and the green water coming into the driver &apos;s room , right ?
This is one of the greatest dangerous environments I &apos;ve seen in my life , and I &apos;ve come back with the man , and I &apos;ve been climbing these fish .
So , I &apos;m 40 feet above the surface of the ship , which is like looking at the upper part of the shoe , you know , it does that in the ocean .
It &apos;s dangerously dangerous .
I &apos;m down , and I &apos;m going to the leadership room and I &apos;m saying , with a lot of skepticism , &quot; Captain , Security and Health Organization . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; Amanda and Health ? — the ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points there .
( Laughter ) But at that moment , what he said couldn &apos;t repeat at the bottom of 48 .
And it can &apos;t replicate that a factory or any building site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; My son — he &apos;s rich , by the way , he calls me my son , and I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; My son , I &apos;m a fishing boat .
My responsibility is to get home and you &apos;re alive .
And my responsibility is to go home much more wealth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s a retreat to you .
And for the rest of that day , safety comes first .
I was like — the idea of creating this lie — this is the feeling of satisfaction when we talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility and being our responsibility , and vice versa .
Anyway , in a lot of things .
I can talk long about the few differences we &apos;ve made on ourselves and an infinite list of ways we &apos;ve misunderstood .
But what is the purpose of all this ?
Consider a theory , and I &apos;m going to share with you now in the next two minutes and 30 seconds .
And this is what happens — the war on work has declared , as a society , for all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s the cold war . Right .
We didn &apos;t start doing that . We didn &apos;t write our drink in the Mexican way , but we did .
And this war has grown at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we filter people on TV , it &apos;s funny .
If there &apos;s a race , it weighs 300 pounds , and it speaks a lot of bad speech , let &apos;s admit that .
We see it all the time .
That &apos;s what the knife looks like , right ?
We turn them into heroes , or we move them to the platform .
That &apos;s what television does .
And we &apos;re really trying to understand that dirty jobs are not , and that &apos;s the first reason why I do this work and I &apos;m not cheating .
This war was built on Madison Street .
I mean , a lot of commercial ads that come from there — on a message path , what &apos;s really being said ?
Your life would be better if you had done a little bit less if you didn &apos;t have a job to do , if you could go home earlier , if you had retired early , that &apos;s all it was , that &apos;s all it was there , over and over and over again .
Washington — I can &apos;t even start talking about the classes and policies that affect this place , the bottom line of jobs available because I don &apos;t really know .
And I recently learned this front in the war .
And this is mass , Silicon Valley , I mean how many people have an iPhone ?
And how many people have Blackberry ?
We &apos;re connected to these devices .
And I will never need that gives a bad impression about the technology revolution .
We love Jihad , not appropriate for this audience .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m not going to suggest that regeneration and tradition are not waste of time .
And nobody celebrates fake things as they celebrate dirty jobs because they know how it gets done .
And the people who use iPhone have common denominations , shared systems , over and over again .
All that — and that &apos;s what makes this device both a genius innovation .
So , we have these new tools , you know .
We have tools today that don &apos;t look like a room and a convenience .
It looks like these things that we &apos;re walking around with .
So the collective impact of everyone , so this was the dominance of a lot and a lot of jobs .
And I realized , maybe after the time of this game — and they hope it &apos;s not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do more than 200 of these things , but we will do as much as we can .
And for me the most important thing to realize the importance of things facing attitudes face to face and actually getting things wrong , not just about organs .
Most things are wrong .
So , we think — who we are , I mean I — that the thing I do is talk about the public relations campaign to work , the hands work , the glamorous labor .
Somebody has to be there to talk about the forgotten benefits .
I mean , with serious property . A lot of property we grew up with , but you know , we lost some of it .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
Infrastructure is a huge deal structure .
This war on work , which I think existed , has losses like other wars .
First of all , infrastructure has declined rates of meeting business schools .
Every year the number of electrodes , the carpenters , the knives , the bakers , the mechanics of pipes , the steam .
The infrastructure functions that everybody talks about creating are expressions of these people , who were declining , over and over again .
In the meantime , we got two trillion dollars , as a minimum , according to the American Society of civic engineers , that we needed to spend so that we could invent the infrastructure that was currently labeled on the fourth place .
So , if I run anything , not like that , I would simply say that the jobs that we hope to accomplish that we hope will create will not last if the jobs that people want .
And I know that the purpose of this conference is to celebrate things that are close and disturbing to us , but I also know that clean and dirty are not reflective .
They &apos;re both sides of his work , just like innovation and imitation , and like risks and responsibility , and like perpetia and anagrams like the poor sheep , which I hope is not terrifying anymore , and like my time spent .
It was great to talk to you and come back to work , if you will ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very small idea , but it can open up the field for billions of big ideas that are tragic inside of us .
And my little idea of doing that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This room is full of women in this room .
It &apos;s full of sleeping women .
I learned the hard way to sleep .
Two and a half years ago , I was raped by the blind .
I broke my head in the office , broke my face &apos;s bones , and the doctors came to put five poles on my right .
And then I started a journey of research and exploration on the value of sleep .
And during my study , I met , of course , doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the best way to increase productivity and inspiration , and the happiness of life is to get enough sleep .
( Applause ) And as women , we will lead ourselves to the summit through this revolution , this is a feminine issue .
And we &apos;re going to sleep on our way to the summit — literally , we &apos;re going to sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep is the symbol of the mess .
I was invited to dinner recently , and the man said , &quot; &quot; Well , he didn &apos;t sleep for four hours last night .
I felt like I had to tell him — but I didn &apos;t — I wanted to say , &quot; &quot; You know .
If you grow an hour more , this meeting would be much more fun than it is now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And there &apos;s a kind of a mood in terms of the lack of sleep between men .
And especially here in Washington , if you have a date with somebody in the morning to eat a breakfast , and I said , &quot; &quot; What do you see at 8 a.m. ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s too late for me , but it &apos;s okay . I &apos;m going to practice tennis , I &apos;m going to do some invisible calls , and then I &apos;m going to ask you at 8 : They think that they &apos;re too busy , but we &apos;re very bad at the end of the time .
So high IQ .
It doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that a person is a successful leadership leader , because the notion of leadership means being able to see the Ice Mountain of our own Titanic ship .
And unfortunately , there are a lot of ice mountains that are hitting our daughters .
In fact , I think that Lehman Brothers , the Titanic owner , if they were brothers and sisters to make sure they were still here today .
( Applause ) Because while the brothers would be completely busy for the hour and a week , the sisters would have noticed the iceberg because they would have had enough sleep hours for seven and a half hours or eight hours , and they would be able to see the big picture of things .
So as we face a lot of disasters in our world today , it &apos;s good for the personal level to bring pleasure and joy and appreciation and efficiency in our lives , and to get the best production of our work and the world as well .
I &apos;m asking you to close your eyes and explore the great ideas that are inside of you and turn your movements a little bit and explore the power of sleep enough .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , jobs and human brain structure .
And I want you to think for a minute about what &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s how much jelly — three pounds of jelly you can put in the palm of your hand , and that quantum can think of the expansion of space between the stars .
He can think of the infinite meaning , and he can think of himself as an infinite meaning .
And this distinctive repetitive fertility that we call self-awareness is what I think is the Holy Grail in neuroscience and hope that one day we will understand how it is .
Well , how do you study this mysterious device ?
I mean , you have a hundred billion neurons , little protocells of protocells , interacting with each other , and from this activity shows a set of capabilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How does this happen ?
There are several ways of taking human brain function .
One of the ways that we use it mainly is to look at patients who have been exposed to permanent damage in a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s a genetic change in a small area of the brain .
What happens next is not a complete decline in all your mental abilities , sort of a sharp break in your mental ability .
What you get is a very selective loss of one circumstance with preserving all the other functions , and that gives you some confidence in ensuring that that part of the brain somehow gets lost in this task .
So you can determine the function of an area and then figure out what the circuit does to produce this particular function .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you some remarkable examples of this .
In fact , I &apos;ll give you three examples , six minutes each of them , during this talk .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
If you look at the first slide there &apos;s this temporal lobe , the frontal lobe , the frontal lobe , OK — the scans that represent the brain .
And if you look , tapestries away inside the surface of the periodic lobby , you can &apos;t see here is a little structure called a boiling alleviation .
And I swam in the face area of the brain because when it hits , you can &apos;t know the faces of people .
You can still know them from their voices and say , yes , that &apos;s Joe but you can &apos;t look at their faces and recognize them , right ?
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
I mean , you know that you are because when your photo covers and you also know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really know yourself .
Okay . Now , this syndrome is known to cause damage to seduction .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , very rare , in fact , very few doctors have heard about it , even neuroscientists .
Her name is Capgras , and this patient , unlike that , was perfectly normal , had been exposed to a head injury , and out of the coma , unlike that , perfectly normal , looking at his mother and saying , &quot; &quot; It looks like my mother , that woman , but she &apos;s an injury .
She &apos;s another woman who claims she &apos;s my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why is this happening ?
Why someone — and this person is completely mindful and smart at all , but when he sees his mother , the illusion is answered and says she &apos;s not his mother .
Now , the most common explanation of this , which you &apos;ll find in every textbook , is Freud &apos;s point of view , which is that this man — and this argument also applies to the woman , by the way , but I &apos;m just going to talk about men .
When you were a little kid , a young child , you had a very sexuality appeal to your mother .
This is called the Odysseus node of Freud .
I &apos;m not saying that I believe this , but this is Freud &apos;s vision .
And then you grow up , the cortex evolves , and these permanent sexual desires stop towards your mother .
Thank God , either all of you will be sexually excited when you see your mothers .
And then what happens is , there &apos;s a injury of your head , you damage the cortex , which allows these underlying desire to go out , very quickly to the surface , and suddenly unconsciously you find yourself sexually excited about your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , this is my mother , why am I sexually excited ?
This is another woman . She &apos;s skeptical . &quot; &quot; This is the only explanation that your damaged brain is accepting .
This is not understandable to me , this argument .
It &apos;s very cool , like all Freud &apos;s arguments — ( Laughter ) — but it &apos;s not understandable because I saw this same illusion , a patient with the same illusion of his bowl dog . ( Laughter )
He says , &quot; &quot; Doc , this is not my movie , it &apos;s just like a philosopher , but it &apos;s another dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Now , try to use Freud &apos;s interpretation here .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re going to start talking about sufficient brutality in all humans , or something like that , and that &apos;s very ridiculous , of course .
Well , what actually happens ?
To explain this strange disorder , we look at the structure and function of the natural visual pathways in the brain .
Usually , the visual signals go in , to the eye article , and you go to the visual regions of the brain .
In fact , there are 30 regions in the back of the brain that are only responsible for vision , and after analyzing all of that , the message goes into a little structure called the boiling gyrus , where you see faces .
There are neurons that are sensitive to faces .
You can call it the facial area of the brain , right ?
I talked about it a little bit .
Now , when this region rotates , you lose your ability to see faces , right ?
But from this region , the message goes to a device called the Leviathan Groups in the limbic system , the emotional center of the brain , and this structure , called the Lake , measures the emotional importance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it a predator ? Is it a predator ? Is it a marriage couch ?
Or is it something so frivolous , like a hair , or a piece of bird , or — I don &apos;t want to point out for that but — a shoe , or something like that ? Okay ?
And you can completely ignore it .
So if the closed alliance is excited , and that &apos;s important , the message goes into the neural system that doesn &apos;t want .
Your heart starts beating faster .
You start burning to get rid of the heat you &apos;re going to produce — from the muscle effort .
And that &apos;s luckily , because we can put two electrodes in the palm of your hand and measure the change in skin resistance from sweating .
And so I can tell you , when you look at something if you &apos;re excited or excited or not , right ?
And I &apos;ll come up with this in a moment .
So my idea was , when this person looks at something , when he looks at — anything in fact , you go to vision zones and — and yet , it analyzes the closed alpha , and you can know it as a customer plant , or a table , or even if it &apos;s your mother anyway , OK ?
And then the message goes to the banana groups , and then you go to the non-voluntary nervous system .
But maybe in this person , the delivery from the Leviathan groups to the limbic system — the emotional center of the brain — has fallen into the accident .
But because the closed alliance is healthy , this person can recognize his mother , and he says , &quot; &quot; Of course , it looks like my mom . &quot; &quot; But because the delivery of the emotional centers are cut off , he says , &quot; &quot; But why , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t feel warm ? &quot; &quot; Or the nun , by the way ? Right ?
( Laughter ) And so , he says , &quot; &quot; How can I understand that there are no emotions ?
This can &apos;t be my mother .
She &apos;s another woman who claims to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test that ?
Well , what you do is , if you take any of you here , put it in front of a screen , and we measured the electrical responses of your skin , and we showed images on the screen , I can measure your sweat when you see something , like a table or a canopy — of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
But when I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or even a pin , you start to sweat , right ?
And also , believe it or not , if you show you your mother &apos;s image — and I talk here about normal people — you start to race .
And you don &apos;t need to be Jewish .
( Laughter ) Now , what happens — what happens if you show this to the patient ?
Take the patient and show him images on the screen and measure the electrical responses of his skin .
Tables and chairs and feelings , nothing happens , as in natural people , but when you see a picture of his mother , the electrical response doesn &apos;t exist .
There is no emotional response to his mother because the wire from vision zones to emotional centers is cut .
It &apos;s natural because vision zones are natural and natural feelings — they &apos;re going to laugh , they &apos;re going to cry , and so on — but the wire of vision is cut , and so he has that illusion that his mother is false .
This is a beautiful example of what we &apos;re working on , take strange psychological syndrome , and it seems incomprehensible , and say that the notion of basic Freud is wrong , and you can actually come up with a precise concept based on the neuroscience known to the brain .
By the way , if this patient goes , and his mother calls him from the next room — she calls him — and he lifts the speaker , he says , &quot; &quot; Oh , Mom , how are you ? Where are you from ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no illusion during the telephone .
Then an hour later , he would come , and he would say , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
You look exactly like my mother . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
The reason is that there &apos;s a different path going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotion centers , and that didn &apos;t fall through the crash .
And that explains why his mother knows through the phone , no problem .
When her face sees her face , he says she &apos;s a lesion .
Well , how are all these complex circuits organized in the brain ?
Is it nature , genes , or are they constructed ?
And we come to this dilemma by looking at other strange syndrome called the illusion limbs .
And you all know what the illusion side is .
When the arm swallows , or the leg when it swallows , because of Ghana , or when you lose it in war , for example , in the Iraq War — and this is a serious problem now — it will continue to feel clearly the presence of the lost arm , which is called the fake arm or the fake leg .
In fact , you can feel this in any part of the body .
Believe it or not , even with internal organs .
I had patients who had removed the womb — removed the uterus — who had the placebo womb , including the placebo inhalers at the same time in the month .
In fact , a student asked me the other day , did they get a placebo ?
( Laughter ) Scientific research material , but we didn &apos;t follow it .
Well , now the next question is , what can you learn about the subjective limbs of doing tests ?
One of the things we found is , about half of the patients with the placebo call that they can move the placebo .
I grew up on his brother &apos;s shoulder , responding to the phone when he ringing , waving with the headache .
This is a convincing feeling , very alive .
The patient is not fluorescent .
He knows that the arm is not there , but , nonetheless , it &apos;s an exciting experience for the patient .
But nonetheless , about half of the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
The illusion side — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But Dr. , the illusion side is paralyzed .
It &apos;s fixed in Church , and it &apos;s very painful .
If I can move it , perhaps pain may recover . Now , why is the illusion end paralyzed ?
This looks like a contradiction in language .
But when we looked at the files of cases , what we found was that , these people who had paralyzed limbs , the original arm was paralyzed by damage in the parasite nerves .
The original nerve of the arm was cut , cut , for example , in a motorcycle accident .
So the patient had an arm that was already hurt , in a shoulder case for months , or a year , and then in an attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon develops the arm , and then the placebo gains the same pain , right ?
This is a serious medical problem .
Patients become depressed .
Some criticized suicide , OK ?
So how do we address this crisis ?
Why do you have a paralyzed fake ?
When I looked at the profile , I found that he had an arm already , and the nerves that provided this arm were cut , and the real arm was paralyzed , and it was placed in a shoulder case for several months before the amputation , and that pain moved into the fake arm .
Why is this happening ?
When the arm was there , but paralyzed , the brain was sending it to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but the visual responses would come back and say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
And this goes into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learning paralysis , OK ?
The brain learns , because of Hebrew &apos;s connection , that just for the arm to move gives you the sense of an arm paralyzed .
And then , when you let the arm go , this learning paralysis goes into the machine — into your image of your body and your fake arm , right ?
Now , how do these patients help ?
How could you ask the idea of paralysis so that you could recover from this very painful convulsion of his vaginal arm ?
Well , what we said , what if I sent it to the fake arm , but I gave it the visual response that the arm slowed it down , right ?
You might be able to fear the illusion pain , the illusion muscular synthesis .
How can you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
But that costs millions of dollars .
So I took a way to do it for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agency .
( Laughter ) Okay ? What you do is you create what I call the mirror box .
You have a box of cartoons with a mirror in half , and then you put the fake arm — the first patient , Dick , came to me .
His hand was smiling 10 years ago .
He had an injury in the enemy , so the nerves cut off and the arm was paralyzed , in a shoulder case for a year , and then she left .
He had a fake arm , very painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
It was a paralyzed fake .
So he came there , and he gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call the mirror box , OK ?
And the patient put his left vascular arm , which was embedded in a kiss , on the left-hand side of the mirror , and the natural arm on the right side of the mirror , and he did the same thing , the sprinkle , and looked inside the mirror , what did he feel ?
He was looking at the fake arm and he was returned to life , because he was looking at the reflection of the natural arm in the mirror , as if the natural arm was returned to life .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Now look , the tail of your fake arm — your real fingers , or move your real fingers and you look at the mirror . &quot; &quot; He would have a visual impression that the fake arm moves , right ?
This is obvious , but the amazing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my wasteful arm moves again , and the pain , the skier egg , recovered . &quot; &quot; And remember , the first patient I come from — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) The first patient I come from , and I look at the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at the reflection of your fake arm . &quot; &quot; And he started to say , &quot; &quot; He doesn &apos;t know my arm .
He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a living experience .
Well , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your natural hand and the illusion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Ah , I can &apos;t move my pink hand . You know it . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your natural hand . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my pink hand moves again , I can &apos;t believe it !
And my pain went . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
And then I said , &quot; &quot; Put your eyes . &quot; &quot; Put your eyes .
&quot; And move your natural hand . &quot;
&quot; Nothing — it &apos;s crawling in a kiss again . &quot;
&quot; Okay , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , she &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
So it was like a kid in a barbershop .
And I said , well , that proves my theory of paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I won &apos;t give the Nobel Prize to make someone move their fake arm .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless capacity , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But I started to think , there might be other kinds of paralysis that you see in neuroscience , like the stroke , the communications disconnect — there might be a learning part of those that you can overcome with a simple machine like a mirror .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Dick , look . &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , this guy can &apos;t hold a mirror everywhere to get rid of his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Dick , look , take it home and exercise it for a week or two .
It might be , after a while of exercise , you can take away the mirror , you can ask the idea of paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm , and get yourself out of pain . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , take it home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s anyway , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; And he took it home , and two weeks later he called me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Dr. , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I went . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What did you go ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was the one that went .
( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this fake arm that I had 10 years ago ?
I went . &quot; &quot; And I said — I worried , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I mean , I changed the perception of this man to his body , what about patients , morality , and everything else ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does that bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , the last three days I had no fake arm , so I didn &apos;t pain as an illusion , no rubble , I didn &apos;t hurt my illusion , all those pain went .
But the problem is that my thumb fingers are still extended from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach the shoulder . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So you can change the design and put it on my forehead so I can , you know , do it and get rid of my fake toes ? &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m kind of magical .
Why is this happening ?
Because the brain is facing an enormous sensory struggle .
He calls him from sight saying that the fake arm has come back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no appropriate receiver , muscle signals that say there &apos;s no arm , right ?
And your motor command says there &apos;s an arm , and because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there &apos;s no fake limb , there &apos;s no arm , right ?
You go into some kind of denial — the signals vanish .
And when the arm disappears , the reward is that pain disappears because you can &apos;t have pain without a floating body there , in space .
So that reward .
Now , this technology has been tested on tens of patients by other groups in Helinsky , so it &apos;s been proven as a cure for illusion pain , and indeed , some have tried to employ it in treatment of stroke .
The stroke , you usually think it &apos;s damage in fibers , nothing you can do .
But it turns out that part of the stroke is a learning paralysis , and it might be possible to treat this part using mirrors .
And this went to medical trials , to help a lot of patients .
Well , now let me move to the third part of my talk , which is another strange phenomenon called Sinestesia .
This was Francis Galton discovered in the 19th century .
He was Charles Darwin &apos;s cousin .
He pointed out that there were some people , who otherwise were completely normal , had this special trait — every time they saw a number that was ours .
Five blue , seven yellow , eight green green , nine Nelly , OK ?
Consider , these people are very natural in other areas .
Or the acute C note . Sometimes the notes trigger color .
The C tunnel is blue , the sharp F tunnel is green , another song might be yellow , OK ?
Why is this happening ?
This is called Spinesthesia — Galton called it Sinesthesia , a synthesis of senses .
In each of us , the senses are distinct .
These are confused senses .
Why is that happening ?
One side of this dilemma is very interesting .
The Seynesian is in the families , so Galton said that this has a genetic foundation , a genetic basis .
Secondly , the Sinaesthesia is about — and this brings me to what I want to point out about the main topic of this talk , which is about creativity — Sinesthesia is eight times more published in artists , poets , literature and other innovators than the rest of the public .
Why is that ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
I &apos;ve never answered it before .
Well , what is the Sinosthesia ? What causes it ?
Well , there are several theories .
One theory is that they &apos;re just nuts .
Now this is not really a scientific theory that we can forget .
Another theory is that they &apos;re busy and drug addicts , right ?
Now , there may be some health in that , because this is more widespread here in the Bay area in San Diego .
( Laughter ) Okay . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in Sinesthesia ? Okay ?
We found that the color zone and the numbers area next to each other in the brain , in the boiling alleviation .
We said there are some spatial dress of regions between color and numbers in the brain .
So every time you see a number , you see a color that &apos;s okay , and that &apos;s why you get a penicillin .
Now remember — why is that happening ?
Why are there global warming in some people ?
Remember that I said it was in families ?
This gives you an idea .
And that is that there is an unnatural gene , a mutation in that gene , that causes this unnatural dress .
In each of us , as it turns out , we &apos;re born with everything else .
So every region in the brain is connected to every other region , and these lie to create the structure of the distinct units of the larger brain .
If there &apos;s a gene that causes that torture , and if this gene turns around , you get a decrease disorder between the areas of the brain that are affected .
And if it &apos;s between numbers and colors , you &apos;ll get simpler numbers and colors .
And if it &apos;s between the notes and the colors , you &apos;ll get the sista of the notes and the colors .
So far , good .
Now what if this gene is shown everywhere in the brain , so that everything is worn ?
Well , think of what artists share , parents and poets , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , connecting with ideas that seem to be , like , &quot; &quot; This East , Juliet is the sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say Juliet is the sun — does that mean that it &apos;s a radioactive ball ?
I mean , mentally dedicated people say that , but this is a different story , right ?
The ordinary people say it &apos;s warm like the sun , it &apos;s warm like the sun , it &apos;s shepherd like the sun .
You immediately find relationships .
Now , if you assume that this network and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , this will result in a much larger metric to metaphorical thinking and creativity in those who have Sinnesia .
And so , there are eight times the case of Sierra Leone from poets , artists and fathers .
Well — it &apos;s a very brainstorming view of the Pennesia .
The last slide — can I take a minute ?
( Applause ) All right . Now I &apos;m going to show you all that you &apos;re going to be synthesizer , but you &apos;re very keen for that .
This is what I call the Martian alphabet , like your alphabet , a thousand , a pandemic , Jim is Jim .
Different forms of different sounds , right ?
Here you have the historical alphabet .
One is Kicky , and one of them is Puba .
Which clever and which is Babylonian ?
How many of you think this is Kkie and those are Buddha ? Raise your hands .
Well , there &apos;s a copy or two .
( Laughter ) How many of you think this is Puba , tickie ? Raise your hands .
99 percent of you .
Well , none of you from Mars , how did you know that ?
Because you all use a model — the synthesizi abstraction — in a sense , you say that that sharp needle , Kicky , in the auditory cortex , the auditory cells are persistent , clever , simulating the visual experience — the sudden experience — so the old shape .
This is so important now , because what it tells you is that your brain is busy in something primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like they &apos;re silly , but those photons in your eyes form this shape , and the hair cells in your ear are triggering the pattern of hearing , but the brain can extract the common thing .
It &apos;s a primitive kind of abstraction , and we now know that this is happening in the boiling alliance of the brain because when it &apos;s damaged , these people are losing the ability to engage in Kikipedia , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
If you ask this guy , what &quot; &quot; not all he &apos;s hearing , &quot; &quot; What does that mean ? The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well if it &apos;s metal and glamorous , that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gone .
You have to measure its own precision , right ? So these guys completely lose the metaphor .
This region is about eight times larger in the highest in humans , than the size of the region in the monkey .
A very interesting thing happens here in the parallel alliance because it &apos;s the crossbar between hearing , vision , touch and become huge in humans — and something interesting happens .
And I think it &apos;s the basis of a lot of human capabilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
All of these questions that philosophers have asked over centuries , we scientists can start to look at through brain imaging and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking the imagination seriously .
Fourteen years ago , I recognized the natural material , the problem of fishing nets , which were the same for centuries .
Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent sensory shapes with the sizes of big buildings in cities around the world .
In fact , I &apos;m not the qualified person .
I didn &apos;t study sculpture and civic engineering or architecture .
In fact , after my graduate school , I had seven art schools , and I was rejected by seven .
And I used to myself to complete my art career , and I drew for about 10 years and one day offered a trip to India .
After I promised to do several exhibitions of my sculpture , I sent the paintings to ship , and I went to Mahabharam .
The exhibition was approaching , and the paintings didn &apos;t get there .
And I had to offer something .
And this fisherman village was famous for artistic objects .
So I tried to use bronze to make one .
But it was difficult , it was expensive and it was big .
So I took a walk on the beach , and I had to find an idea , and I was watching fishermen pulling their fishermen into the sand beach .
I &apos;ve seen that scene maybe every day there , but that time it was different , I had a new idea of making objects that look like silver objects without using heavy materials .
My first &quot; &quot; mask &quot; &quot; was made with the help of these fishermen .
It &apos;s a object that expresses itself , called &quot; &quot; The Understand Goals . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I put it on columns in order to photograph it .
And I found out how flexible it is , how it responds to each other with air and differentiates its shape .
I was fascinated by it .
I continued to study the letter in collaboration with designers in Tanzania and Daniel .
I loved the little details . I gave my work to my work , but I want to make bigger objects , and I want to move from something that you &apos;re looking at is lost .
Back in India to work with fishermen , we first created a network of about a million and a half million handheld drugs that were built in Madrid for a while .
And thousands of them had seen it as a city planner called Manuel Sula Muralis , and he had designed a marine interface in Portto . Portugal .
And he asked me to be able to build this as a permanent model of the city .
I didn &apos;t know if that was possible to introduce my art .
In a permanent engineer , it &apos;s the opposite of the qualities that exist in my weakest soft contexts .
For two years , I &apos;ve been looking for a kind of cloth that can reach out in front of the ultraviolet radiation and the saltwater and the pollution , and at the same time it &apos;s safe enough to move safely with the wind .
And we needed something to comment on the network in the middle of a traffic jam .
So we &apos;ve lifted a 34,000-pound metal ring .
And it &apos;s designed to move acceptably within the boundaries that are required to hold the winds of the hurricane .
But there was no computer program that could generate a model of something that was moving , and at the same time , the mesh .
I met a very special flight engineer who was designed for the American lottery race named Peter Hell .
And it helped me to overcome the two beliefs of precise shape and flexible motion .
This object can &apos;t be built in my usual way by connecting the nodes by hand , so it won &apos;t last in front of the hurricane .
So we &apos;ve created a way of collaborating with fisheries and depending on their various machines , we &apos;ve been able to come up with a way that we can use in the model .
And there was no way to transmit this weird , weird , new , productive machine .
So we created a new machine .
And after three years of work , I had two kids , we were able to create a network of 50,000 square meters .
It was hard to believe that what I &apos;ve imagined has now been built , and it has always become a body without losing anything from the last patch and transforming the process into modern machines .
( Applause ) The traffic was anonymous and obsolete .
But now I &apos;m a teacher .
I walked down the object for the first time .
I saw the wind handshake , and I felt safe , and at the same time I felt connected to the extended sky .
Since then , my life has changed .
I wanted to start making these objects in cities around the world .
And I &apos;m going to share with you two of them , and they &apos;re the newest makers of my work .
Here in the history hall in the Philadelphia City Council — it &apos;s a public square — I felt like I had to use a hotter material out of the fishing network .
We applied an experiment using small particles of water to create a self-dry spray that formed from the wind , and in the test we discovered that it could form dry taste and interact with people without beating them .
And I used this technique to make an object that tracks the subway lines from the ground at a moment , and it was a X-ray test of the transportation lines .
The next challenge was in Bennial in Denver in America , and I was asked to introduce a model that expresses 35 Western countries in one object .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know how to start with it , but I said yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , the challenge .
I read about the earthquake that struck Chile recently , and how the tsunami wave spread across the entire Atlantic Ocean .
And how it changed the position of tectonic paintings that speed the rotation of the Earth and the shorter of the day .
So I called the National Environment of the Ocean and the atmosphere , and I asked them to share with me the tsunami information , and I turned it into this shape .
I call it 1.26 , it &apos;s the number of cash in the microseconds that we have today on Earth .
You couldn &apos;t build this object with a circle .
Because the shape was very complicated .
So I replaced the iron with a complex type of cloth , which is about 15 times stronger than steel .
The object now becomes a very light and flexible and very light structure that can be linked to the building , and literally become part of the entire city tissue .
And there was no program that could isolate and study all these complex networks and shape them and study them based on ground gravity .
So we made a program for that purpose .
And then someone in New York called me , wondering if it could be possible to do the same thing in Time Square or in highways .
So soft objects allow me to form these things , and to build these objects that are the size of a skyscraper .
They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I have a dream of building models like that in cities around the world in places that you need .
Fourteen years ago , I was looking for beauty in the heritage of hand .
Now , I &apos;m integrating high-tech materials and engineering to make distinct shapes with a very large scale , like building sizes .
The range of art is expanding .
And I &apos;ll close with this story .
I got a call from a friend in Venice .
He says that my attorney at the office doesn &apos;t care about art at all , and he never went to an art day , or an artistic exhibition that everybody would come down from the building and get out and get down this object .
They received their official suit on the grass to watch the interfaces of the object with air systems next to people they might not know to participate together to rediscover the wonders of the universe .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to understand this illustration is to look at the horizontal axis of your age .
At some point after puberty , we get to the minimum level on the map .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
I was young .
This was my team .
( Laughter ) I was interested in sports .
I didn &apos;t want to play them or watch them .
What I wanted to do , I wanted to hunt .
I grew up in my country hunting on the beaches of Connecticut , and these are the creatures I saw on a regular basis .
But after I got to college , after I got home in the early &apos; 90s , that &apos;s what I found .
My team shrunk .
It &apos;s like having a list that &apos;s literally destroyed .
And as I said who looked forward to that , from my point of view as a fisherman , he started a kind of knowledge , well , how did the rest of the world think about this ?
I first looked at fish markets .
And when I went to it , and despite where I was in Northern Carolina , Paris or London , I kept seeing a four-odd of creatures , over and over again , on the menu of food , on ice , shrimp , tuna , salmon and cod .
I think this is very strange , and when I looked at them , I was wondering , did anybody notice this decline in the size of the market ?
When I looked at it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team .
The ordinary people , their structures in the marine food were like this .
It &apos;s not an extraordinary human trait that &apos;s reduced the natural world down to the minimum amount of elements .
We did that before , 10,000 years ago , when we got out .
If you look at the fire fossils 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see the nerves , the wolves , you &apos;ll see all sorts of different species .
And if you look 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
They &apos;re also birds .
If you look at the lists in New York City restaurant 150 to 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see penguins , your chickens , your chickens and tens of ducks .
And if you look at a telescope at the age of raising modern animals , you &apos;ll see four : spiritual worms , ducks , chicken and bananas .
So it makes sense to go this way .
But how did we get in this direction ?
Okay ...
First of all , that &apos;s a new problem .
That &apos;s how we hunt from the oceans 50 years ago .
The Second World War was a huge incentive to allow ourselves .
All the technologies that we &apos;ve found during World War II , the sonar , the polymers lightweight all of these things are redirected to fish .
And so you see this tremendous crowd of fishing capabilities , four times in the course of time , from the end of World War II to the present time .
That means we extract between 80 to 90 million tons of tuna .
That &apos;s the equivalent of human weight in China coming out of the sea every year .
And it &apos;s no accident that we use China for example because China is the largest exporter nation in the world .
That &apos;s half the story .
The other half is that there &apos;s an incredible mutation in fish breeding and aquaculture , just in the last year or two , it &apos;s beginning to go beyond the wild fish that we produce .
So if you add wild fish and farm fish together , you can get the equivalent of two species of the ocean every year .
And again , it &apos;s not coincidentally that we use China as the largest fisheries , and also the largest fish farmer .
So let &apos;s look through four options .
One : Until now , the most consumer-consuming marine food in shrimp America .
The shrimp are a terrible product .
Five , 10 , 15 pounds of wild fish are systematically killing to bring one species of shrimp into the market .
It &apos;s also an inefficient fuel in the markets .
In a recent study that came out of the Dutch University , they found that shrimp are one of the most dense carbons you can hunt .
So they can grow them , and actually people are planting them , and they were growing a lot of them .
The problem is .
The places where shrimp are farmed in the wild in the mangrove forest .
Look at these isolated roots .
Those are the things that connect soil together , protect coastal , and create habitats for all kinds of small fish and shrimp all kinds of things that are important to this environment .
Well , this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangroves .
We &apos;ve lost millions of acres of coastal mangrove trees over 30 or 40 years .
That rate slowed down , but we still have a huge deficit in the mangrove .
And the other thing here is the phenomenon of film maker Mark Benjamin called &quot; &quot; moisture . &quot; &quot; This phenomenon is very connected to something that you &apos;ve never seen on the tropical reef .
Because what &apos;s happening now , we have shrimp clouds , with huge amounts of it , what happens is that the viral fishing in turn turns into shrimp food .
And sometimes , a lot of these ships work with slaves and they &apos;re hunting what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; garbage fish . &quot; &quot; The fish that we like to see in coral reefs , skip them around and turn them into a shrimp sheet , an ecosystem that literally eats itself and sticks shrimp .
Next is one of the most consumer-consuming marine food in America , and also across the West , the tuna .
Even the tuna of these global fish ultimately .
It has to be done in order to run very well .
In our administrative area , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; regional organization of fisheries , &quot; &quot; and it shortens ICAT , the International Commission to keep tuna in the Atlantic .
The great natural scientist Carl Savana once called him , &quot; The International Index to hunt all the tuna fish . &quot;
Of course we &apos;ve seen an incredible improvement in ICAT in the last few years , there &apos;s a field of improvement , but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish , and to control it , we have to control the world .
The tuna can also be raised , but the tuna is incredibly bad for fisheries .
Many don &apos;t know that , but the tuna is from warm blood .
TED can heat it by 20 degrees above room temperature , it can swim 40 miles an hour .
So it removes a lot of the benefits of farming fish , right ?
Fish farm from cold blood cells that don &apos;t move very much .
And that &apos;s a good thing to increase the protein rate in .
But if you get this crazy , wild creature swimming 40 miles an hour and heats his blood , it &apos;s not a candidate to plant it fish .
The next creature is the most consumer-based marine food in America and all the way to the peaceful West .
Now salmon is a river , too , but it doesn &apos;t have to happen by fishing .
That &apos;s my state Connecticut .
Connecticut is home with a lot of salmon .
But if you look at the map of the state , each dot is a dam .
There are over 3,000 bodies in the state .
And I always say that &apos;s why people in the state are so nervous — ( Laughter ) if someone can just release Chi Connecticut , I feel that we can become a much better world .
But I made this comment in the NIH agreement , and this man from North Carolina , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s hard not to be in Connecticut , because we have here in North Carolina 35,000 ships , it &apos;s a national epidemic , it &apos;s a global epidemic .
There are worms everywhere , and these are exactly the things that prevent salmon from getting to reproduction zones .
And as a result , we have to farm it fish , and salmon has been successful for several points .
When I first started planting salmon fish , it could take about six pounds of wild fish to make one pound of salmon fish .
The industry has improved a lot .
We &apos;ve got two to one , although there &apos;s a little bit of cheating , because if you look at the way the feed is produced for the fisheries , they measure the calories of pounds per pound of salmon .
Those batteries are reducing fish .
So what happens — what &apos;s called FIFO , the fish is internal and a fish out — it &apos;s hard to say .
But anyway , the pride of this industry has reduced the amount of fish per pound of salmon fish .
The problem leads us crazy with the amount of salmon produced .
Fish farms are the fastest food system growing on Earth .
It grows by seven percent a year .
Despite the very few fish in the markets , we still kill small fish .
Not only fish but what we feed fish , we feed fish for chicken and pigs .
We get chicken feeding on fish , and strangely , fish feeding on chicken .
Because chicken derivatives , blood and bone feeds with fish .
I always wondered , is there a fish eating a chicken that feeds on a fish ?
It &apos;s a kind of reframing between chicken and egg . ( Laughter ) All together , although it leads to a terrible mess .
What are we talking about ? It &apos;s something between 20 to 30 million tons of wild creatures that we extract from the ocean and use .
That &apos;s the equivalent of a third of China , or the entire United States of humans extract from the sea every year .
The last four species .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; White Fish . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of fish being recycled to white fish , but the way to tell the story , I think , through this classic piece of American cookie invention , the pharmaceutical sandwiches .
I started with elephant fish tanks from the helicopter .
And I started with the local privilege that he found that when he served in McDonald on Friday , no one came .
Because it was a Catholic community , it needed fish .
He even went to Ray Cruke and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go and bring you fish bonoch , it &apos;s going to be made of a robot fish .
Ray Cruke said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work .
I want to make a hamburger , and there will be a slice of sandwiches on the cake .
But let &apos;s do it , let &apos;s try a moment .
It will sell more and it will be the winner . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s sad for the oceans that Hella Berger didn &apos;t work .
So he made a robot with a helicopter .
Unfortunately , the grass came about 30 cents .
Ray wanted it 25 cents , so she turned to the Atlantic .
We all know what happened to the Atlantic cod in New England .
And so far Sandwich fishes fish made from Pollock Alaska , it &apos;s one of the largest dense fish in the United States , extract from two to three million seals a year .
If we go through Pollock , the next option is probably the crystal .
The crystal of those fish he hadn &apos;t heard of 20 years ago .
It &apos;s actually a very efficient conversion of plant proteins in the animal that &apos;s a gift from the sky to the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a sustainable solution , so it turns from eggs to tobacco in nine months .
And the problem is that when we look at the West , it doesn &apos;t do what the West wants to do .
It &apos;s really no such thing as an aquaculture file .
It doesn &apos;t have EPA and DHA or 3S , we all think we &apos;re going to make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , the first thing for poor fish ?
Fish that represent the biggest part of 20 to 30 million tons .
Well , one possibility that a lot of environmental protectors have influenced how we can eat them ?
Can we eat it instead of feeding it for the people ?
There are arguments for that .
It &apos;s a big efficiency in fuel consumption to bring it into the market , a small part of the cost of shrimp fuels , and at the top of the carbon efficiency scale .
It &apos;s also rich in Omega 3 , and a big source of EPA and DHA .
So this is possible .
And if we were to go on this path , what I &apos;d like to say is , instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a few dollars a ton , and making it a watersheet , we could reduce the fisheries and make it our way to treat these fish alone ?
Another possibility is through , and it &apos;s very interesting , looking at the sounds of the two rocks , particularly the sea sludge .
The sea floor has a high percentage of EPA and DHA , similar to the canned tuna .
It &apos;s also efficient fuel .
To bring a pound from sea oyster to markets about one / 30 carbon as it is required to make cows .
Because it doesn &apos;t need a fish file , actually you get Omega 3S through water filtration .
This is where Omega 3S comes from , it doesn &apos;t come from fish .
The algae made Omega-3 biologically focused only in fish .
The seaweed and the shell melts are purifying enormous amounts of water .
One seaweed can filter tens of gallons a day .
And this is very important when we look at the world .
Now , the reproduction , the overuse of phosphorus by waterways causes an enormous breeding of algae .
More than 400 new dead areas have been created in the last 20 years , enormous sources of marine life .
We can also not look at fish at all .
We can look at vegetables .
We can look at marine weeds all these different kinds of things that can be rich in Omega 3S , proteins , from very good things as well .
Water filters just like sea slate .
It turns out that you can feed it to cows .
I &apos;m not a big fan of cattle .
But if you want to keep the cattle growing in time and place where water resources are limited , the algae increases in the water , you don &apos;t have to steal it , a major consideration .
And the last fish are a thumb mark .
We have the ability to raise farm fish that in turn provides the protein .
That this creature has to be my plants , growing very quickly , adaptable to climate change and has what fish have from the EPA , DHA , OMG 3 acids that we &apos;re looking for .
And this kind of paper exists .
These topics have been reported for 15 years .
Every time someone tells me , &quot; &quot; We can do all this . We can do it . We know how to do it .
We can produce fish that &apos;s a clear profit from the marine protein and it has Omega-3S . &quot; &quot; Great .
But it &apos;s not expanding its range .
It &apos;s time to expand its range .
If we do , 30 million metric tons of marine food , a third of global fishing , will remain in water .
So I think what I &apos;m saying is this is what we can go through .
We tend to go with our appetite instead of our minds .
But if we go through this , or some numbers from that , we might have a little more of this .
Thank you .
( Applause )
It just became like the fetus in his mother &apos;s womb .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it turns out that Koreans are completely separate from each other .
Excuse me . Thank you . It was fun . ( Transing : It was . )
Information , in a form of energy , flows directly through all of our sensory systems and then explodes into this enormous poster of what this current moment looks like , as well as smell , and the taste at this moment is what you feel and what it looks like .
I &apos;m an object with energy associated with the energy that I have around me through my perception of the right hemisphere .
And at this moment , we &apos;re in complete perfection and achieving the concept of beauty .
Half of the left brain is a completely different place .
Half of the left brain is thinking linear and systematic .
And half of the left brain is thinking of language .
And all I can harvest is that energy — energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ?
And I felt lightly in my body . And imagine .
