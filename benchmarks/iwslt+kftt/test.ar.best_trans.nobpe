By the end of this year , there will be about a billion people on this planet who are effectively using social media .
The only thing they have in common is they will die .
And even though that might be a kind of terrible idea , I think has profound implications worth exploring .
Now the first thing that got me thinking about this is a blog by Derek , Miller earlier this year , who was a journalist in science and technology that died in cancer .
And what Miller did was he made his family and friends write a blog that was published after he died in Jazz .
This is what I wrote at the beginning of that .
He said , &quot; &quot; There I am , and this is my last blog on my blog .
Pretty much earlier , I asked that as soon as my parents could stop suffering from cancer , on my family and friends to publish this ready letter that I wrote — as the first part of the transition from effectively to archive . &quot; &quot; Now , as an archive journalist Archive Miller might have written better and more mirrors than others , and the fact of the matter is that we &apos;re all making archives that are completely different from anything earlier .
Look at some statistics for a moment .
Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every minute .
There are 200 million tweets spreading every day .
And the average Facebook user creates 90 pieces of content a month .
So when we think about our parents or grandparents , at best they might have produced some images or home videos , or memes that live in a box somewhere .
But today , very rich technical archives are being created to stay in cloud systems for indefinitely , years after we die .
And I think that will create an interesting opportunity for technology .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technology , so what I want to do briefly is to draw a picture of what the present and the future will be .
And we actually see some services that are designed to make us decide what will happen to our personal files on the Internet and our accounts in social media after we die .
One of them actually , quite appropriate , found me when I went to Delly in a restaurant in New York at Furkner .
( Audio ) AO : Hi .
Death : Adam ?
AA : Yeah .
Death : Death can surprise you anywhere , or time , even in organic food restaurants .
AA : Who is that ?
Death : Go to idie.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) AO : It &apos;s kind of scary , right ?
So what this service does , quite simply , is it allows you to create a message or video that can be posted on Facebook after you die .
Another service now is called 1,000 memories .
And what this service allows is to create an improvisation for people that you love online , full of images and video and stories that you can post-death .
But what I think comes next is more interesting .
Now Deep Roy , probably familiar with a lot of you who , earlier in March , showed how he was able to analyze over 90,000 hours of homework videos .
I think that the ability of machines to understand human languages and process massive amounts of data continues to improve , will be possible to analyze a whole amount of content — tweets , images , videos and blogs — that we produce with massive numbers .
And I think in order to do this , it &apos;s going to be possible for our digital personalities to continue to interact in the real world long after our death and thanks to the enormous amount of content that we create and technological capabilities to accommodate all of it .
Now we &apos;ve already begun to see some experiments here .
A service called my next tweet analyzing all the Twitter flow , all I posted on Twitter , to predict what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the result may be kind of funny .
You can imagine what this might look like in five or 20 years from now with our technology &apos;s development .
Far forward , MIT lab works on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if these robots were able to interact depending on their own traits of a particular person based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that one would produce in their lifetime ?
Finally , they came back to this famous scene from the 2008 election night in the United States , when CNN reported that &quot; &quot; Holfram was alive for Hop will.E.E.E. in the Channel studio with Chris Cooper .
What if we could use the same kind of technology to radio our loved ones in our living rooms — in interaction in a semi-alive way based on all the constructed content when they were alive .
I think that will become very possible and the amount of data that we use and technological capabilities to understand are growing exponentially .
Now in closing , I think what we all need to think about if we want that to become our reality — and if that &apos;s true , what that means to the notion of life and everything that comes next .
Thank you very much .

People go back to work after a career break : I call them employers after a break .
These people who have come out of practice to care for elderly , for children , to pursue personal interests or a personal health problem .
All sorts of career shifts that are close to : veterans and military partners , retired retirements coming from retirement or reoffending labor to home .
Back to work after the career disconnect , it &apos;s hard to connect between employers and employers again .
Worker people might see that employing people with their own biography as a high-risk issue , and people who might have skeptical about their ability to abuse their career , especially if they &apos;ve gone away for a long time .
This disconnect is the problem I &apos;m trying to help solve .
Now , successful explorers are everywhere and everywhere .
This is Sami Kalva .
It &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the U.K. who has been cut off for five years to be at home with his five children .
The Singapore newspapers recently wrote about nurses returned to work after long intersections .
To talk about the long slides of disruption , this is Mimi Kahen .
It &apos;s a social worker in Urang County , which went back to work at the foundations of social services after 25 years of collapse .
And this is the longest disconnect I know .
The Supreme Court Sandra de Okonor &apos;s Supreme Court fell off of work for five years early in her career .
And this is Tracy Shapero who cut off work for 13 years .
Trey was invited to write articles by the TV show , the Toys Shooting from people who were trying to go back to work but went through a difficult time .
Trey wrote that she was a mother of five children who loved having her time at home , but because of the divorce procedures that she had , she had to go back to work , and she wanted to rework to her life because she loved work .
She was doing what many of us do when we felt like we were a good day looking for a job .
She was looking for a job in investment or accounting , and she had spent the last nine months researching serious companies online and offering requests to get a job without results .
I met Tracy in June 2011 , when the TV show asked me the Toy Shoo if I could work with her to see if I could help her change things .
The first thing I said to Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go out to the general public in her search for work and tell everyone she wanted to go back to work .
I also told her , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll have a lot of talks that don &apos;t lead to anything .
My prediction of that , and don &apos;t let it bind you .
There will be a few that will eventually lead to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tracy a little bit later , but I want to show you the discovery of his work when I was trying to go back to work after my career , 11 years outside the workforce full-time .
And this is that the view of people for you has frozen over time .
What I mean by that is that when you start connecting with people and back in connecting to these people from the past , the people that I worked with or you were going to school , they would remind you what you were in the past before the intersection of your career .
And that even if you feel self-upset over time , as many of us do , as we move away from our professional identities .
So for example , you might think of yourself as a person like this .
This is me , complaining after a whole day of driving my little bus .
Or I &apos;m here in the kitchen .
But these people from the past , they have no idea all of this .
They just remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a huge amount of trust to come back to connect with these people and hear their sense of wanting to go back to work .
There &apos;s something else I &apos;m clearly reminded of from my time of work .
And that was that I was barely following the news of the business sector .
My experience is in finance . And I barely followed any news when I was at home , I was interested in my four young children .
I was afraid to go to a job interview and start talking about a company that no longer exists .
So I had to reengage with Wall Street Journal and read it for six months of the cover before I felt like I had a storm about what was going on in the business world again .
I think consumers are the basis of workforce , and that &apos;s why .
We have a scarce of functional transmission of a husband or partners .
We &apos;re in a more stable time of life .
We have a big business experience .
We have a more productive view .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at the expense of the owner of the work .
We also have the activity and excitement about going back to work because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
On the other hand , I talk to employers , and I have two very important things about employing the consumers .
One , the employers are worried that the poor explorers are technically poor .
Now , I can tell you , I &apos;ve been lack of technological knowledge at a certain point , it &apos;s a temporary case .
I was doing the financial analysis a long time ago using Lotus 1-2-3 program .
I don &apos;t know if any of you can even remember it that far , but I had to relearn it through the pixel .
It wasn &apos;t actually hard . A lot of commands are the same .
I found PowerPoint more challenging , but I &apos;m now using PowerPoint all the time .
Tell the listeners that the workshops are expecting them to come to the table with a practical knowledge of the basic library management software .
And if they don &apos;t get fast , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
And they do .
The second important thing that people around the audience do is they worry that the listeners don &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell the consumers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or they haven &apos;t changed while they were in the career sector .
This is not a business owner .
It &apos;s the responsibility of the consumers to explain that to the owner of the work where they can add the most valuable thing .
Back in 2010 , I started noticing something .
I &apos;ve been watching programs going back to work since 2008 , and in 2010 I started noticing the opportunity to work with short wages , whether it &apos;s called a training period or not , but training like experience , as a way for professionals to go back to work .
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sarah Lee and started integrating training programs designed to bring back to work .
I witnessed the return of an architect as a candidate to bring it back to work in a different way that provides a training program at the level of entering the military , and then get a permanent job after that .
And I saw two universities combined training programs in middle school education programs in professional life .
So I wrote a report on what I was watching , which became an article for Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; Over-year-olds . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editors there on this title , and also for this artwork where you can see a 40-year-old intern with the rest of the college learners .
And then , from the door of the trial by Fox Pizons News , they called the concept &quot; &quot; 50-year-old training . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Even five of the largest financial services companies have retraining programs for the return of professionals in the financial sector .
At this point , hundreds of people shared .
These training teams are paid , and people who have gone to permanent jobs demand competitive salaries .
Now , seven of the largest engineering companies are driving training programs for returning engineers to work as part of an initiative with the American organization for engineers .
Now , why do companies embrace training programs ?
Because training allows the owner to build a decision to assign a sample that actually works instead of a series of work interviews , and the employer doesn &apos;t have to make the job decision to function all the time until the training period is over .
It removes the period of perceptual risk training that some managers agree when they recruit returns to work , and they drag outsiders who turn into good jobs .
Think about how far we are .
Before that , most of the employers were not interested in dealing with the consumers at all .
But now , it &apos;s not just programs that are being developed specifically with returns to work in mind , but you can &apos;t even ask these programs unless you have a period of disconnect in your professional biography .
This is a real change mark , for the right institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for the investors , we can also solve it for the artistic transfer .
In fact , a business owner just told me that veterans came back to a business program based on retraining .
And there &apos;s no reason why there &apos;s no penalty training program .
It combines different and the same concept .
So let me tell you what happened to Tracy Shaberu .
Remember that she had to report all the people she knew about wanting to go back to work .
Well , one crucial conversation with a mother / father in her community led to a work show for Tersey , and working was a financial circuit .
But it was a temporary job .
The company told her that there was a possibility that it could turn into more , but no guarantee .
That was in the fall of 2011 .
She loved Tracy , and I loved people that the office was less than 10 minutes away from her home .
So even though there was another job presentation for her in another company with a full-time job , she decided to take her opportunity with this training and plan what was better .
Well , it ended up overcoming all their expectations , and the company didn &apos;t just give her permanent presentation in the beginning of 2012 , but they made it more interesting and challenging , because they knew what Terrilli could do .
Fast forward to 2015 , Trey was upgraded .
They paid instead of studying it at night for MBA .
Trey &apos;s temporary work was a test , just like training , and it ended up becoming profitable for everyone who bought and owned the work .
Now , my goal is to reintroduce training to more and more employers .
But at the same time , if you &apos;re going to go back to work after a career break , don &apos;t want to propose a training period or reorder the training period for the owner who doesn &apos;t have a formal retraining program .
Be the story of their first success , and you can be the example of more people coming .
Thank you .

Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar power industry .
And my little skepticism is looking to impose ourselves in the environment by paying attention to ...
... to the genocide .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
Ha . Stay with me for a moment .
It could take a while to download it .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re just going to — we can just skip it — I &apos;m going to skip the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar Technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .

It was one afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I was working at ACLU as the organizing consultation of science .
I really loved my work , but I was one of those days when I was feeling a little frustrated .
So I went across the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
Chris worked in the organization for over 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge .
I explained to Chris that I feel a little stuck .
I was investigating a number of issues between science and civil liberty — very interesting .
But I wanted the organization to engage in these issues in a bigger way , in a way that could actually make a difference .
So Kerr walked into the heart of the subject and said , &quot; Well , among all the problems that you &apos;ve been investigating , what are the top five ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination and reproduction techniques and biombanks and ...
Oh , there &apos;s this really cool thing about MRI and using it to detect lying and ...
Oh , of course there &apos;s genetic invention . &quot; Genome invention ? &quot;
Yes , you know , invention on human genes .
&quot; No .
You tell me that the American government makes patents on parts of the human body ?
This can &apos;t be true . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
And 20 minutes later , he actually came back to my office .
Oh God ! You &apos;re right ! Who should we fight ?
( Laughter ) Chris &apos;s really a great lawyer , but he almost doesn &apos;t know anything about patent systems , and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew a little bit about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer for you to imagine a patent lawyer .
So we had to learn a lot before we could lift a lawsuit .
At first we needed to understand exactly what the patent was when someone invented a gene .
The invention of genes usually contains tens of orders , but the most controversial part of this is what &apos;s called the DNA isolation , which is a piece of DNA that is removed from the cell .
And the gene inventor says , &quot; &quot; Look ? &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t invent genes in your body , we invented isolated genes , and that &apos;s true , but the problem is that in the case of using genes , it takes to be isolated .
And the patent was not only given a particular isolated gene , but for every possible copy of that gene .
So , what does that mean ?
It means you can &apos;t give your doctor your doctor or ask her or ask her to take a look at him , to see if he has any mutations without taking permission of the patent .
It also means that it &apos;s a patent right to prevent anybody from using this gene in research or clinic tests .
And so patent holders are usually private companies to close the human genome , which is affecting patients .
Abiel hopes that 10-year-old child with QQT syndrome , which is a serious heart disease , if it doesn &apos;t treat , it could cause sudden death .
The company that got my innocence developed in Gene was associated with this disease , testing to diagnose this syndrome .
But then the company declared it , and they never gave it .
So another laboratory tried to offer the test , but the company with the patent , I wanted to spend the lab by violating the patent .
And as a result , the test was unavailable for two years .
Meanwhile , Abil died of not diagnosed with QQQT syndrome .
Obviously the patents made a problem , and it was damage to patients .
But is there a way we can challenge them ?
It turns out that the Supreme Court has shown in a long series of issues that some things are not allowed to patent .
You can &apos;t patent nature products like air , water , sales , periodic table elements .
We can &apos;t register the laws of nature as a gravitational law : energy = mass = diffrared 2 .
These are fundamental things that need to be used by everyone , and not particularly for anyone .
It seems to us that DNA is the fundamental component of life that regulates to producing all of our proteins , one of the products of nature and the laws of nature , both regardless of whether it &apos;s inside our bodies or at the bottom of a test plant .
As we looked at this problem , we traveled all over the country to talk to all sorts of experts in different fields of scientists , physicists , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we are politically right and legally , at least theoretically .
They all thought that maybe we could win the patent genes almost zero .
Why is that ?
Well , the patent office caused these patent problems for more than 20 years .
There were thousands of patents in human genes , literally .
The patent settlement took a hostile situation right now , the biotechnology industry evolved under this practice , and it was legislated to ban the patent of genes a year later , and Congress did nothing at all .
Now , Chris and I were not the kind of challenge that took us from the challenge , and we heard , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not enough to be right . &quot; &quot; It was caused to accept the challenge .
So , we started planning to build our case .
Now , patent issues continue to be a form : the company spends a company for small , accessible , technical problems .
We didn &apos;t get interested in these kinds of problems , and we thought this was a bigger issue than that .
It was taking scientific freedom , medical progress , patient rights .
So we decided to develop a case not as a case of patent your usual inventions , but as a civil rights issue .
We set out to define the holder of a gene patent , which used to exploit very strongly , and then organize a broad variety of inventors and experts who could tell the court about all the ways that these patents are afforded by patients and science innovation .
The main candidate for interviews was Myriad Genetics , which is a company in Salt City , in Yutah .
Myriad has a patent in Gennett , BRCA1 , Gene BRCA2 .
Women with mutations on these genes are remarkably high risk for breast cancer and ovarian cancer .
Myriad used her patent to keep a complete denial of using BCRA in the United States .
It &apos;s what different labs had to stop the BCRA test .
It costs a lot of money to test over 3,000 dollars .
The company has stopped sharing their regular information with the global scientific community .
And perhaps the worst of all , for many years , was that Myriad refused to talk about the test to include additional mutations that were discovered by a team of researchers in France .
It &apos;s estimated that over that period for many years , 12 percent of women who have been tested have gotten the wrong results , the negative test results were supposed to be positive .
Here &apos;s Kathryn Maxwell .
Ellen , the sister of Kathlin , had breast cancer at the age of 40 , and was tested by Myriad .
The results were negative .
The family was allowed .
That means Ellen &apos;s cancer doesn &apos;t work in the family and that other family members don &apos;t need the test .
But two years later , Catherine diagnosed advanced malignant cancer .
It turns out Catholic &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who got the wrong negative results .
If Ellen was diagnosed correctly , Catherine would have been tested , and her cancer would have stopped .
Since we &apos;ve stabilized MyiCod , we &apos;ve had to then create a coalition of invited and experts who can get these problems out into light .
We ended up getting 20 highly committed prosecutors in genetics , geneticists who received detailed answers and stopping four important research consultants , together like 150,000 scientists and clinicians and members of women who couldn &apos;t afford the cost of Myriad &apos;s test or wanted to get any second opinion that they couldn &apos;t patent .
One of the most important challenges that we have in preparation for the issue is to figure out how good it is to communicate with science .
So , in order to discuss that what Myriad did was not invent and that the BCRA gene from nature products we had to explain some basic concepts : what is the genomes ? What is the DNA ?
How is DNA isolated ? How is that not a invention ?
We spent hours and hours with lawyers and experts trying to come up in ways to explain these concepts in a very simple and accurate way .
And we ended up very dependent on metaphorical expressions like gold .
So , isolating DNA like taking gold out of a mountain or getting it out of a river bottom .
You can get a patent in how gold mining , but not the patent of the gold itself .
It might take a lot of effort and hard work to get gold out of the mountain , but you can &apos;t get a patent in gold . It &apos;s still gone .
And once you extract gold , you can use it in a lot of things that you couldn &apos;t do when gold was in the mountain , for example , you can use it in the jewelry industry , you can still get a patent in the gold . It &apos;s still going .
Now , we &apos;re in 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to publish our case .
We published it in the Federal Court , in the northern part of New York , and randomly , the judge Robert Switzerland was denied to take the case .
In March 2010 , the judge issued a vote that 152 pages and a complete victory for our cause .
As we read his opinion , we couldn &apos;t overcome how science described the issue properly .
I mean , we saw it well , but not so much .
How did he develop this deep understanding of the issue at this short time ?
We couldn &apos;t understand how that happened .
So , it seems that a judge &apos;s employee Switzerland wasn &apos;t just a lawyer ; it was a scientist .
It wasn &apos;t just a world that had a Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What &apos;s the most wonderful luck !
Next , Myriad got up in the United States Court of the Federal Circle .
And that &apos;s where things got really interesting .
First , at a pivotal point of this case , the U.S. government started role-down .
So in the court of the region , the government gave a short speech for the Myriad .
But now , in a direct compensation of her patent office , the government issued a speech that rethought that case under a court &apos;s opinion , and they concluded that isolated DNA is not a patent .
This was a really big and unexpected thing .
The Federal Court listened to all the patent issues , and he heard about it as a patent proposal .
So , despite this remarkable progress , we expected to lose .
And it happened .
Sort of like that .
It ended up splitting into the opinion , two to one .
But the judge that we &apos;ve done this for quite different reasons .
The first judge advocates Laurie based on a totally wrong biological theory .
( Laughter ) He decided that Myriad made a new chemical material , which is absolutely incredible .
MyriLeads didn &apos;t argue , I came out of the dark .
The other judge , Murray said that it &apos;s essentially consistent with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
But she thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to remove the biotechnology industry . &quot; &quot; The third judge , Brillison agreed with us .
So now we &apos;ve done a diplomat at the Supreme Court .
And when you give a distraction at the Supreme Court , you have to give a question to court to respond to it .
Usually you take a long poverty form like a whole page full of lots of Indians , since then .
We &apos;ve made the shortest question that was introduced soon .
Four words : Is anyone worth taking a patent in genes ?
Now , when Chris asked me about these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
You might say , &quot; &quot; Anybody should take a gene patent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want judges to take my same reaction when I asked that problem seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I really couldn &apos;t answer it .
The Supreme Court only enjoys one percent of the issues presented to it and agreed to listen to us .
The day of the verbal lever came , which was very exciting , a long line of people outside , standing in line of 2 : 30 in the morning to try to enter the courtroom .
Two breast cancer organizations no longer Act FORCE organized a demonstration on court writers .
While Chris and I sat in the entrance a few moments before he entered to discuss the most important issue in his career .
It was clearly how nervous I was .
But I was struck when I walked into the courtroom and looked at this incredible amount of faces that were traded from women who shared their own stories , very personal geneticists who sacrifice much of their professional time to devote themselves to this issue and a variety of physicians , the PDA , the PTSD , gave a note to court in the case .
And also , in the room , three leaders from the Human Genome Project , one of them who contributed to discovering the DNA of James Watson , who made a note to the court pointed out to give me a patent in the genes with &quot; &quot; craftsmanship . &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of groups represented in the room and the contributions of all of them actually made this day after it was at stake .
The same motion was very impressive .
Chris raised the intelligence .
But for me , the most exciting aspect was to treat the judges with isolated DNA , despite the series of hot analogies and reverse replacements in the same way that our legal team treats in the last seven years .
The judge is like a DNA catalog , and we extracted a medical plant from the Amazon River .
The judge Roberts looked like a baseball boat in a tree .
And on one of my favorite moments , the judge Sotomayor declared that isolated DNA is just the nature of sitting in front of us . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt so confident as we left the court room that day , but I couldn &apos;t even predict the result : nine to zero .
&quot; Part of the DNA is naturally made of nature , &quot; and being isolated simply doesn &apos;t make it qualified to get a patent in it .
Moreover , Myriad did nothing within 24 hours of decision-making announced six workers that they were going to start presenting the BRCA test .
And some of them promised to do the test at a lower price than what Myriad was doing .
Some promised to give a more inclusive test than what Myriad did .
But of course , the decision is much bigger than Myriad .
It ended 25 years of patents in human genes in the United States .
And I became a major barrier in the way of discoveries and biochemical innovations .
And she helped to make sure that my patients like Abiel , Catherine and Elon had the right to get the test they needed .
A few weeks after the court announcement , I got a letter in the mail .
From Bob Cook Dijan , a professor at Duke University and one of the first ones that Chris and I visited when we started discussing this issue .
I opened it up , and I found a little , frustrated animal .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk when we accepted that issue .
And that led us to take that risk , we knew we were right .
It took about eight years from the beginning to the end with a lot of fluctuations and slopes down the road .
Little luck helped us , of course , but the groups that we built and the alliances that we created are the ones that are the best .
Thank you .

The second quote is quoted by a president .
Sadly , the answer is yes .
And then you can put configurations and test them .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
Everybody , literally , is more than the sum of its parts .
Where are the economic networks ?
What we looked at in detail was property networks .
We also personalize value for the company .
How were they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies working in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
Let me show you through this representation .
Hello . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through an episode of about eight of my projects , collaborated with the Danish Sorry Sorrin Burroughs .
We call ourselves Burroughs and Row , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first project , which I called &quot; &quot; Uncle &apos;s phone . &quot; &quot; And I inspired it from my strange uncle in asking me to do things for him , as if I was an extension of his liver — to turn on light or bring a glass of water for him , a cigarette box .
And as I grew up , it got worse and worse , and I started thinking about it as a kind of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because Uncle is a respectable person in the Indian family .
And the situation that got me mad and amazed me most was using it for the ground phone .
He grabs the gun and he expects me to ask him the number .
So in response to my uncle &apos;s gift , I made it &quot; &quot; Uncle &apos;s phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that two people need to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone designer for one person .
But the problem is , when I got out of the house and went to university , I started to lose its orders .
So I made a golden writer through which he could distribute his instructions to his sons and daughters around the world as an email .
So what he needed to do was take a paper and roll it in the pregnant , print his letter or something and pull the paper out .
This device will automatically send the message as an email to the meaning person .
So here you can see , we &apos;ve merged a lot of electronics that understand all these mechanical motions and convert them into digital .
So my uncle only handles the mechanical interface .
And of course , the thing had to be big and sort of rituals , the way my uncle admired me .
The next work is to install the sound that we call the &quot; &quot; belly . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work on the principle of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy creatures and sensation and kindness .
So the way it works is we have these paintings , which we put on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures that hide .
And once you have silence , you kind of crawl out .
And if they &apos;re more silent , they tend their mind out .
And with the minimum sound , they hide again .
So we had these panels in three walls of the room .
And we had over 500 of these mines hidden behind .
So here &apos;s how it works .
This is a prototype .
So when it &apos;s quiet , it kind of comes out of the panels .
And you hear what humans do , or you do the real organisms .
They &apos;re kind of immune to the sounds that they scare for a while .
And they don &apos;t interact with the background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in a moment that they don &apos;t interact with .
( Cheers ) But they interact with the sounds of the front . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Beeps ) So we worked really hard to make it as vibrant as possible .
So every cow has its own behavior , psychological , flip mood , personality and so on .
So this is an early prototype .
Of course , much better then .
And we made it interact with people , but we found that people are games and children with them .
This installed a video called &quot; &quot; lost person . &quot; &quot; And we were very fascinated by playing at the beginning of the imagination .
How could it be possible to experience the sense of imagination ?
So we worked with a company that specializes in monitoring the camera , and we asked them to develop software , using a camera that could look at people in the room and track them and replace one person in the background , and make it invisible .
So I &apos;m going to show you an early prototype .
On the right-hand side you can see my colleague Sorrin , who &apos;s already in space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processor video where the camera made it invisible .
SB : In the room . Bob ! It turned into something unseen .
And you can see that the camera is tracking it and shooting it .
It &apos;s a very prime video . So we didn &apos;t have to deal with overlap and all of that , but that &apos;s getting very close , later .
And the way we used it was that it was in a room where we had a camera looking at space , and we had a screen on every wall .
And as people walk in the room , they &apos;ll see themselves on the screen , except one difference : one person was always hidden wherever they moved in the room .
This is a work called &quot; &quot; The shadow of the Sun . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a paper , like a snapshot of a childhood sketch of an oil or a sun .
And from the front , this thing appears very powerful and complex , and on the side , it appears to be very weak .
So people walk in the room and maybe ignore it almost , thinking it &apos;s just a garbage on the ground .
But once they walk next to it , they start climbing the wall in a constructive way .
And it &apos;s going to get tired , and it &apos;s going to collapse every time .
( Laughter ) So this works as a cartoon of a man upside down .
His head is so heavy , it &apos;s filled with heavy ideas , that he kind of drops into his hat , and his body has been proven like a plant .
What he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s moving in a maneuverable way on his head with an unpredictable movement and very slow motion .
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there , the surface was very flat , it would start walking around in space .
And there are no cords .
So I &apos;ll show you an example — so when people get into the room , the thing is activated .
And very slowly , over a few minutes , it gets kind of painful , and then it earns a warm force and it looks almost like it &apos;s about to fall .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to engage in the instinct scenes to go and help , or rescue it .
But he doesn &apos;t really need that , because , again , he can sort of raise himself .
And this work has been a real technical challenge for us , and we &apos;ve worked on the same thing , like most of our work , over the years to make mechanics true and achieve movement equilibrium .
And it was very important for us to take the moment that it would fall , because if we somehow made it so that it would fall , it would hurt itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t satisfy that capability , or the desire to help him .
So I &apos;m going to show you a quick video where we do an experimental scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
This is my colleague . He launched it .
Now he &apos;s nervous , so he &apos;s going to grab him .
But he doesn &apos;t need that , because he tells himself to raise himself .
So this is a work that we were fascinated by , working with the aesthetic of the puppies embedded with thousands of different sizes of light fibers , which fills like the night sky .
It &apos;s about the size of the night sky .
And so we wrapped this into a bubble , which is like a bear bloodstream , which was hanging on the surface .
And the idea was to show a little bit of a very cold , far away and commercially like the universe in a regular shape like the bear &apos;s blood , which is comfortable and intimate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the shape of the bear &apos;s blood and you &apos;d recognize it almost as a hole in space , as if you were looking at a silent night sky .
And this is the last work , which is in the process of achievement , called &quot; &quot; space walker . &quot; &quot; Well , imagine a little cube standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and once you approach it , try to decode you to grow into a cube is twice as high as four times as size .
So this object extends and continues to create dynamics with people moving around — like it &apos;s sort of trying to hide inside its needs or something .
So we &apos;re working with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really like technology , because it &apos;s causing us a lot of meals in our work over the years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that we can help us express the patterns of emotions and behaviors in these creatures that we create .
And once our brain is creature , it &apos;s almost like a creative process is figuring out how this creature really wants to be and the shape it wants to take and the way it wants to move .
Thank you .

Well , today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
And specifically , I &apos;d like to talk about error by talking about love .
Maybe most of us will love many times over our lifetime , and in English , this metaphor , hunger , is actually the main way we &apos;re talking about that experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I imagine this expression , what I envision comes from a moving drawing — like there &apos;s a guy , walking on the sidewalk , without paying attention , crossing an open hole , and just clinging to fall in the neighborhood channel down .
And I envision that this way because falling is not a jump .
Function is unintended , uncontrolled .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our consent .
And this is — this is the key way to talk about starting a new relationship .
I &apos;m a writer and an English teacher too , which means I think of words to earn my life .
You can say that I &apos;m paid to say that the language that we use is important , and I want to say that many of the metaphorical expressions that we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — is a problem .
So , with love , we fall .
We hit .
We deserve .
We lose consciousness .
We burn a passion .
Love makes us crazy , makes us sick .
Our hearts hurt , and they break it later .
So our metaphorical expressions are the experience of love someone with a very high or even illness .
( Laughter ) It is .
And it puts us in the position of the victims of unexpected circumstances and unexpected circumstances at all .
In a book that passes out alone , there are 16 translations of the gram , which is the word the Bible uses to convey angry god .
( Laughter ) Here we use the same word by talking about love that we use to explain the thousands of people . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So , how did that happen ?
How did we connect love to great pain and suffering ?
And why are we talking about this terribly beautiful experience as if we were victims ?
It &apos;s hard questions , but I have some theories .
In which , I want to focus on a particular metaphor , which is the idea of love as insane .
When I started looking for romantic love for the first time , I found these crazy expressions everywhere .
The history of Western culture is in words that connect love to the mental illness .
These are just some examples .
And William Shakespeare said , &quot; Love is just insane , &quot; &quot; as you would like . &quot; &quot; Frederick Netchh said , &quot; There &apos;s always some crazy in love . &quot;
&quot; It made me look , it made me look very crazy with love — &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) to the great philosopher , Beyoncé Nulz . ( Laughter )
I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a very troubled relationship from the beginning .
And the distance was far from the first two years , so this for me was a very beautiful , sad moment .
I can remember one particular moment .
I was sitting on the bed in a downhill in South America , and I was watching the person I loved coming out of the door .
And it was late around the middle of the night , we had a lot on the dinner table , and when we went back to our room , he threw his rigs in a suitcase and went out .
I was 22 , and it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
I had another week until the airstrip was coming back , and I knew the name of the town I was in , and the name of the city I had to get to to to travel across to the outside , but I had no idea how to reach it .
I didn &apos;t have a terrorist and very little money , and I didn &apos;t speak Spanish .
Someone who &apos;s more adventurous than me may be an opportunity , but I was really paralyzed .
I was sitting there .
And it exploded from crying .
But even though I was horrified , some voices in my head were saying , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
I must be doing love very well . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some of me wanted to feel miserable in love .
And this seems very strange to me right now , but at the age of 22 , I was yearning to live exciting experiments , and at that moment , I was irrational and angry and devastating , and very bizarre , I thought somehow my sense of the guy who had just left me was a toilet .
It shouldn &apos;t really be surprising , given that according to Wikipedia , there are eight movies , 14 songs , and two albums and a novel called &quot; crazy love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
Help us .
We spent another week kind of happy to travel together .
After that , when I got to the pilot I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrible and so great .
It must be a real love story . &quot; &quot; I expected to feel my first love as crazy , and certainly , it was absolutely true .
But someone like this — as if my entire happiness was standing on his interview lover — it wasn &apos;t appropriate for me or for him .
But I think this experience of love is not strange .
Most of us feel a little crazy in the early stages of romantic love .
In fact , there &apos;s a study that emphasizes that this is quite natural , because , from the perspective of neurochemistry , romantic love and mental illness , they &apos;re not easily separated .
That &apos;s true .
I &apos;ve been using this study since 1999 , blood analysis to emphasize that the levels of serotonin for those who have had a new love relationship with a very large degree of serotonin levels for people who have been diagnosed with diabetes .
There &apos;s even some evidence that love is associated with the changes of our mood states and our behavior .
And there are other studies that make sure that most relationships start this way .
Researchers see that the lower levels of serotonin are linked to intrinsic thinking about the topic of love , which is like feeling someone has created a camp in your brain .
And most of us feel this way when we fall in love for the first time .
But the good news is that it &apos;s been a long time — from a few months to two years usually .
When I came back from my journey to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , checking my email , leaning to a reply of the boy I loved .
I decided that if my friends didn &apos;t understand my intense career , then I don &apos;t need to believe them .
So I stopped hanging around with most of them .
And maybe that was the most reflective year of my life .
But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if I could be miserable , I would prove how much I loved it .
And if I could prove that , then we would eventually be together .
This is the real crazy , because there &apos;s no universal rule that says that suffering deserves great pay , but we talk about love as if it &apos;s real .
Our experience in love is both biological and cultural .
Biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in the brain , it tells us that love is painful when , after trees or separation , the chemical reward is drawn .
And in fact — and you &apos;ve probably heard this — from a neurochemical perspective , a very similar disconnect with the cocaine , which I find reassuring .
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and enhance these ideas about love .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about pain expressions , addiction and insanity .
It &apos;s kind of an interesting reaction .
Love is strong and sometimes painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories lead us to expect love to be strong and painful .
What &apos;s interesting to me is that this is all happening in the culture that decides the only continuous marriage of life .
It seems like we want both sides : we want love to feel crazy , and we want it to continue to be all the time .
It sounds terrible .
( Laughter ) To fix that , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
So imagine if we were all less negative in love .
If we &apos;re safer , more open , more ridiculous , and instead of falling in love , we rise to love .
I know that requires a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest that .
In their book , &quot; &quot; Metaphor that we live in , &quot; &quot; the linguistic exhibition of Mark Johnson and George Lucav has a very important solution to this dilemma , which is to change our metaphor .
They say that expressions actually shape the way we face the world , and they can work even as evidence of future business , self-fulfilling self-fulfilling entities .
John Johnson and Coke proposed a new metaphor for love : Love as a shared artwork .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
Language speaks about metaphorical expressions as having genes , which are basically a way of looking at all the implications of it , or the ideas that are present in a particular metaphor .
And Johnson Wolkov talked about all this common artistic work : effort , consent , patience , common objectives .
These ideas fit our cultural investment well in our long-term romantic commitment , and they work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , opposition , unintentional , non-zero-sum — because that expression brings far more complex ideas to experience someone &apos;s love .
If love is a shared artwork , then love is an aesthetic experience .
Love is unpredictable , love is creator , it requires love to communicate and discipline , it &apos;s frustrating and it requires emotionally .
Love involves both happiness and pain .
After all , every experience of love is different .
When I was younger , I never had to let me ask for more love , even that I had to accept any love coming .
When Juliet met 14 years old for the first time — or , when Juliet couldn &apos;t be with Romo , who she &apos;d met four days ago , she didn &apos;t feel disappointed or worrying .
Where is it ?
She wants to die .
Really ?
And as a new , at this stage in the play , the third chapter of five , Romo didn &apos;t die .
It was alive , it was healthy , it was only denied from the city .
I realize that Verona in the 16th century , unlike modern North America , but when I first read this play , when I was 14 , also , Juliet &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
The reframing of love as something that I can create with someone I admire , not as something that happens to me without my will or my consent , is a encouraging thing .
It &apos;s still hard .
Love still seems completely crazy and devastating some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my work in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to do together .
That &apos;s not easy , too .
But it &apos;s much better than the alternative , which is that thing that looks like crazy .
This version of love is not about winning or losing somebody &apos;s death .
In fact , it requires you to trust your life and talk about things when trust is difficult , which seems very simple , but it &apos;s actually kind of a radical act .
And that &apos;s because you stop thinking about yourself and what you gain or lose your relationship , and you start thinking about what you have to offer .
This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not good collaborators . Maybe that &apos;s not for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than you had planned , but it &apos;s still beautiful . &quot; &quot; The nice thing about collaborative artwork is that it won &apos;t melt or draw or carve itself .
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really happy to be here .
I &apos;m happy to be here ; otherwise it would be a little weird .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Here . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
It &apos;s here .
I mean the Earth .
And by saying , &quot; &quot; All of us . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean from this stage ; it &apos;s life , all life forms on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to single-celled , from burial to living weirdness , to flying bears . ( Laughter )
What &apos;s interesting is that the Earth is the only place we know that it has life — 8.7 million species .
We &apos;ve looked elsewhere , maybe we didn &apos;t look for corals or enough , but we looked and we didn &apos;t find . The Earth is the only place we know that life is .
Is Earth special ?
This is a question I &apos;ve always wanted to know the answer since I was a little kid , and I think 80 percent of this stage has thought about itself and also wanted to know the answer .
To understand if there are other planets — there are in our solar system or outside — they can contain life , so the first step is to understand what life requires .
It turns out , in all these 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
On the one hand , all life forms on Earth need energy .
The complex life like us extend our energy from the sun , but life underground can get its energy from sources like chemical reactions .
There are a number of different energy sources available on all the planets .
On the other hand , all life forms need food or food .
And this sounds a difficult task , especially if you want a green tomato .
( Laughter ) But all life forms on Earth depend only six elements , and these elements can be found in any plant body in our solar system .
So this puts it in the middle as a long column , the hardest thing to get to .
It &apos;s not the uniform ; it &apos;s the water .
( Laughter ) Even though the monkey was awesome . ( Laughter )
And it &apos;s not frozen water , not water in a visceral state ; it &apos;s liquid water .
That &apos;s what life needs to continue , all forms of life .
And many of the parts of the solar system don &apos;t have liquid water ; so we don &apos;t look there .
There are other bodies in the solar system that may have liquid water , maybe more than Earth , but it &apos;s exposed under frozen crust ; so it &apos;s hard to get , and it &apos;s hard to get , and it &apos;s even harder to detect if there &apos;s life there .
So that leaves us with a few bodies we should think about .
So let &apos;s simplify the problem ourselves .
Let &apos;s just think of liquid water on the planet .
There are only three objects in our solar system that we can think about in terms of having liquid water on the planet , and they are — in order to sequence the distance of the sun — Venus , the Earth , Mars .
You want to have a climate that allows water to stay liquid .
You have to be careful about this climate .
You don &apos;t have to have a very dense climate or poison or heat ; then you end up being very hot like a flower , and you can &apos;t get liquid water .
But if you have very thin climate or cold , you end up like Mars ; it &apos;s very cold .
So Venus is extremely hot , and Mars is very cold , and the Earth is totally isolated .
You can look at these pictures behind me and you &apos;ll see automatically where , in our solar system , life can continue .
It &apos;s a problem like Goldiloccccccccccccccccus , which is so simple that a child can understand .
But , I &apos;d like to remind you of two things that we often don &apos;t think of as Goldiloccccccccccco &apos;s story , but I think they &apos;ve done something here .
The first thing : if the mother humor was so cold when Goldiloccccccccccus walked into the room , does that mean that it &apos;s always been so cold ?
Or maybe it was a waste earlier ?
So for a moment , Goldiloccccccccccccccus enters the answer that we will get in the story .
It &apos;s also for planets .
They &apos;re not static things , they &apos;re changing .
They differ and evolve .
And also aerial covers .
So let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
It &apos;s not the highest resolution , it &apos;s not the most glamorous , it &apos;s not the latest picture , but it &apos;s a picture that shows the glacier running its way on the planet , running through its flow water ; a stream that needs hundreds or thousands or dozens of years to form .
This can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
Mars climate today is so hot and cold enough to stabilize liquid water .
This picture tells you that Mars climate has changed , and it has changed dramatically .
And it changed the case that it would have been a good planet for life , because the three main requirements of life have been around for a long time .
Where did this atmosphere allow water to stay liquid on the surface ?
Well , there &apos;s an idea that says it escapes into space .
The atmosphere molecules have enough energy to get away from the gravity of the planet , going to space without reference .
And this happens to all the atmospheric objects .
Comets have cats that are amazing visual representations of climate parties .
But Venus also has an atmosphere that &apos;s been celebrated all the time , and also Mars and Earth .
It &apos;s just a matter of degree and the range of these parties .
So we want to figure out how long they &apos;ve done ; so we can explain this shift .
How does the climate get energy for parties ?
How do atoms get enough energy to get away ?
There are two ways , if we want to simplify things a little bit .
The first is sunlight .
The light from the Sun can be absorbed by the climate atoms heat atoms .
Yes , I dance ; they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even in my wedding . ( Laughter )
They get enough energy to escape and escape from the gravity of the planet just by acquiring heat .
The other way to get energy is solar wind .
And they &apos;re atoms , a mass , a material that goes off the surface of the Sun and goes shocking through the solar system at 400 kilometers per second , and sometimes even faster through the solar storms , pushing through space towards planets and its atmospheres and maybe exchanging atmospheric atoms with the energy required for parties as well .
This is interesting to me because it &apos;s linked to life .
I mentioned that there are two things about Goldilocccccccccccccccccccccus &apos;s story that I wanted to bring your attention to ; the second thing is more complicated .
If the father &apos;s bear pot was too hot , and the mother humor was too cold , shouldn &apos;t the child &apos;s bear vessel be more cooler if we were going to walk through the context ?
This is something that you &apos;ve accepted all your life , when you think about it a little bit more , maybe it doesn &apos;t look that simple .
And of course , the distance between the planet and the sun determines its temperature .
And this has an effect on its own realities of life .
But maybe there are other things we should think about .
Maybe it &apos;s the same vessels that also help to identify the story , what &apos;s the right reasoning .
I can talk to you about a lot of different characteristics of these three planets can affect their realities of life , but for selfish reasons associated with my research and the fact that I &apos;m standing here holding the cows and not you — ( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to talk to you for a minute or two about magnetic fields .
The Earth has one ; Venus and Mars doesn &apos;t .
The magnetic fields are generating in the deep habitat of the planet by delivering electric delivery to a massive liquid material that creates the old magnetic field and the big magnetic field that falls the Earth .
If you have a connection , you know which direction is north .
Venus and Mars don &apos;t have that .
If you have a connection to Venus or Mars , you understand it ; you &apos;re the results .
( Laughter ) Does this affect the toughness of life ?
Well , what might that be ?
Older scientists see that the Earth &apos;s magnetic field works as the armor of its atmospheres , reflects the solar wind atoms away from the planet by influencing the power of the field with the electrical charges of these atoms .
But I &apos;d rather see it as a container glass of the authorities , just for planets .
( Laughter ) And sadly , my colleagues who are going to see this later will realize that this is the first time in our society &apos;s history where solar wind is resembling the ocean . ( Laughter )
Well , the result then is that the Earth may have been protected for billions of years because we have a magnetic field .
The atmosphere wasn &apos;t able to get away .
Mars , on the other hand , was unprotected because it misses the magnetic field , and over billions of years it may have been regenerated from its atmosphere enough to cause it to convert from a planet that is good for life to the planet that we see today .
Other scientists think that the magnetic field may work in a much more like a tree on a compound , where the planet can interact with the amount of solar wind than the planet would have been interacting with itself .
These dose can collect energy from the solar wind .
A magnetic field can collect energy from solar wind that allows more atmosphere to occur .
It &apos;s an idea that we have to test , but the impact and how it works seems obvious .
That &apos;s because we know that solar wind is being installed in our atmosphere ; here on Earth .
This energy is driven by the length of the magnetic field down where the polar regions , where it causes a beautiful polar horizon .
If you &apos;ve tested it , you know it &apos;s great .
We know that energy goes in .
And we try to measure how many atoms come out , and whether the magnetic field affects it in any way .
So I &apos;ve given you a problem here , but I don &apos;t have a solution for it yet .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on finding it .
Well , we &apos;ve sent a spacecraft to three planets .
Some of them are still in orbit , including the MAVEN spacecraft that &apos;s going on around Mars right now , that I &apos;ve been involved in that &apos;s being led from here ; outside of Colorado .
It &apos;s designed to measure how far away the atmosphere is .
We have similar measurements of Venus and Earth .
When we get all the measurements , we can combine all of them , and we can understand how the three planets interact with the space environment , with what surrounds them .
And we can decide whether the magnetic field is important for life , or not .
When did we get the answer , why should we care ?
I mean , I &apos;m very interested ...
And too , but very hard .
( Laughter ) First of all , the answer to this question will teach us a lot about these three planets : Venus , Earth and Mars , not just about how they interact with their ocean today , but also how they &apos;ve been for billions of years ; whether they &apos;re good for life or not .
It will teach us about the atmosphere that surrounds us and close to us .
Instead , what we &apos;re going to learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres anywhere , including the planets that we &apos;re observing now about stars .
For example , the Keer spacecraft that was built and controlled from here in Boulder , you noticed over the last two years an area in the sky the size of a cooler printer , and found thousands of planets — in one area of the sky the size of a cooler printer that we don &apos;t think is different from any other part of the sky .
We &apos;ve gone on for 20 years , not knowing one planet outside our solar system , to knowing so much of it now , that we don &apos;t know which one we &apos;re going to first meet .
Any lever will help .
In fact , according to the observations that Keer took and some other observations like this , we now believe that within 200 billion stars in the Milky Way alone , each star has , at least one planet .
In addition , estimates suggest that somewhere between 40 billion to 100 billion of these planets could be considered livable in our galaxy .
We have these observations from those planets , but we don &apos;t know yet which ones are good for life .
It &apos;s a little bit like being stuck with a red spot — ( Laughter ) on stage , and you know that there are other worlds out there , and you really want to know more about them , you want to respond to them and learn whether one or two of them looks a little bit like you .
You can &apos;t do that ; you can &apos;t go there , not yet .
And so you have to use the tools that you &apos;ve developed around you for flower , land and Mars , and you have to apply them to these other situations , and hopefully you come up with reasonable conclusions of data , and that you &apos;re going to be able to identify the best candidates to be healthy planets , who are not .
Eventually , at least , this is our red area , here .
This is the only planet that we know is good for life , even though it &apos;s pretty soon we &apos;ll know more .
But now , this is the only planet that is alive , this is our red area .
I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
That &apos;s true .
Think about everything that he brought to us .
Think of all the services that we use all the communications , all sorts of entertainment and all kinds of business and trade .
And this is happening in our lifetime .
I &apos;m very sure that one day we &apos;ll write history a few hundred years from now , our generation will be remembered by the generation that has become connected online , the generation that has built something that is our own and truly global .
But at the same time , the Internet has problems , very serious problems with information security and problems with users &apos; privacy .
And I spent the years of my career addressing these problems .
So let me show you something .
This is Brin .
This flexible disk is a disk of five inches infected with Parin .
It &apos;s the first virus we found for personal computers .
And in fact , we know where Brin came from .
We know because he says that inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
Okay .
This is the slice of the orange disk , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that here he says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the cell . &quot; &quot; And then he goes on and says , &quot; &quot; 1986 , simplicity and glory .
Simple and glory are the first names of Pakistani .
There &apos;s actually a phone number and a title in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
Now , 2011 .
That was 25 years ago .
The problem with personal computer viruses has 25 years now .
So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
So let &apos;s see , these are some of the images I took when I was in Pakistan .
This is from Lahore City , which is about 300 kilometers south of Apolland , where Bin Laden was caught .
This is what the street looks like .
And this is the street that leads to this building , a 730 house in a system in the town of Alabama .
And I knocked the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
Simple and glory , still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the condom is simple .
And the sitting is his brother , glory .
These are the first books of the first personal computer virus .
Now of course , we &apos;ve had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them what they felt about what they started .
And I got some symptoms from knowing that both simple and glory had more viruses than once and other viruses were totally different over these years .
So there &apos;s a kind of justice in the world above all .
Now , viruses that we used to see in the &apos; 80s and the &apos; 90s are not a problem anymore .
So let me show you some examples of what they looked like .
What I &apos;m working on here is a system that I can run an old software on a modern computer .
So let me just ride some of the consequences , go there .
What we have here is an old virus list .
So let me just play some on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s turn on a four-four virus first .
And you can see on the top of the screen , there &apos;s a four-and-4-gram passing through your computer when you get this .
You know you &apos;ve got it because it actually shows up .
This is another one called Crash virus invented in Russia in 1992 .
Let me show you one that actually operates some sounds .
( Recording noises ) And the last red example is what the marshmallow virus does .
Yes , there &apos;s a person walking through your screen once you get caught .
So it was easy to know that you had a virus when viruses were programming amateurs and teenagers .
Today , it &apos;s not programmed by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What we have here in the background is an example of the systems that we &apos;re working on in our lab where we &apos;re tracking viruses globally .
So we see in real time that we &apos;ve stopped a virus in Sweden , Taiwan , Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if you call back our lab systems through the network , we can see in real time just an idea of how many viruses are these malware examples that we find every day .
This is the last virus we discovered in a profile called the convey.exe .
And we found it here three seconds ago that he accepted , six seconds ago .
And if we go through the page , it &apos;s just phenomenal .
We find tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands .
And this is the last 20 minutes of malware programs every day .
So where does all this come from ?
Well today , it &apos;s an organized criminal gangs programming these viruses because they get money from their viral .
It &apos;s like a guerrilla to go to gangks.com.
This site works in Moscow , where they buy laptops .
So if you &apos;re an viruses programmer and you &apos;re able to get Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing with it , you can sell these computers with other people &apos;s computers .
And they &apos;re actually going to pay you money for these computers .
So how do these people turn money into money ?
Well , there are many different ways like checking banking guidelines , which steal money from your bank account online when you do bank work on the web or keyboard records .
The keyboard sits in the computer silently , hidden from the waiting , and it records anything you follow .
So you &apos;re sitting in your computer looking at Google .
Every search that you do at Google saves and sends to the criminals .
Every email you write saves and sends to criminals .
Same with every secret word and so on .
But what they &apos;re looking for is time periods when you &apos;re on the web and you &apos;re buying on the web in any electronic store .
Because when you buy in the store , you write your name and your credit card address and your traffic card number .
And this is an example of a file that we found in a server a few weeks ago .
This is the number of credit cards , this is the history of the end of the prayer , and that &apos;s the secret number , and that &apos;s the name of the card owner .
Once you get credit card information , other people can enter the network and buy what you want with this information .
And that &apos;s obviously a problem .
Now we have a whole black market and economic business systems built for cybercrime .
An example of how these people can do their operations , we went and took a look at the Intercept pages and looked for people who were needed .
We found people like Porn Snowden originally from Sweden and his partner in crime also in the profiles that were required in Interval , Mr. Shelkushima Jane , an American citizen .
These guys were running a process called IMU , an electronic crime process where they had millions of them .
Now both of them are Harbor .
No one knows where they are .
The U.S. officials just a few weeks ago , Jamaica was calculated in the Swiss bank back to Mr. Jane , and that calculation had 14.9 million dollars in America .
So how much money is generated by cybercrime is enormous .
That means that cybercriminals can invest in their attacks .
We know that cybercriminals hire programmers , hire people to test their code with new systems with SCL databases .
And they can afford to see how we work like how security men work and try to find their way about which security security we can build .
They also use the global nature of the Internet for their benefit .
I mean , the Internet is global .
That &apos;s why the Internet is called .
And if we go and take a look at what &apos;s going on in the virtual world , here &apos;s a video made by Clarm Netflix , showing how one malware family can move around the world .
This process thinks that it &apos;s starting from Estonia moving from one country to the last time someone tries to close the site .
So you can &apos;t stop these people .
They &apos;re going to turn from country to country , from jurisdictions to other people moving around the world using the fact that we don &apos;t have the ability to operate global priorities like this .
So the Internet is like giving someone a free airplane ticket to all the cybercriminals in the world .
The criminals who were unable to reach us before could reach us .
So how do you really go to find criminals on the network ?
How do you really track them ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is a single infected file .
Here I &apos;m looking at the X Packet of a picture that has a security threat .
And that basically means if you want to see this picture in your Windows computer , it &apos;s actually controlling your computer and running code .
Now if you look at the picture file , that &apos;s OK , there &apos;s a little bit of a picture , and here &apos;s where the attack code begins .
And this code has been promoted , so let &apos;s decode the code .
They &apos;ve been promoted using XOR 97 .
You just have to believe me it is , it is .
And we can go here and really start to decode the code .
Well , the yellow part of the code is now unsymbolized .
And I know it doesn &apos;t look very different from the origin .
But just keep staring at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here , you can see the title of a Web here , Monsesesesee.com / i.exe , and when you show this picture in your computer , it &apos;s actually going to remove and run that program .
And that &apos;s the back door that &apos;s going to dominate your computer .
But more interestingly , if we continue to decode the code , we find this mysterious sentence that says O600,000 KOSERS .
That code there below the code as a kind of signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I was looking at that and trying to figure out what it meant .
So , of course , I did search for it at Google .
I didn &apos;t find any results . It wasn &apos;t there .
So I talked to young people in the lab .
And we have two Russian people in our labs , and one of them said , well , it ends up with Ross , like Russia .
And 78 is the symbol of the city of St. Petersburg .
Perhaps , for example , you can find it from some phone numbers and automotive paintings and things like this .
So I went looking for interactions in St. Petersburg , and in a long way , we finally found a particular location .
Here &apos;s a Russian guy who was working on the web a few years ago who ran his own website running a blog under the Live Journal .
And in this blog , he &apos;s talking about his life about his life in St. Petersburg , at the beginning of his 20s , about his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a very nice car .
In fact , this guy is driving a Benz 6,600 bathtub with a six-liter engine and 400 horses .
Now this is a beautiful car for a young man in the 20s in St. Petersburg .
How do I know about his car ?
It &apos;s not about it .
He actually got a crash with him .
In the middle of the city in St. Petersburg , he actually hit his car with another car .
And he put pictures in the blog about his car accident , this is his mantis , and here &apos;s Lda Samara , who shocked it .
And you can actually see the celestial panel end at 78RUS .
And if you take a look at the image of the scene , you can see the square panel is O600,000 KORS .
Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I &apos;m here , I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when the electronic criminals are caught ?
Well , in most cases , you don &apos;t get there yet .
The vast majority of cybercrime issues , we don &apos;t know which continent these attacks are .
And even if we can find criminals , there &apos;s probably no product .
Local police don &apos;t behave , and if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t catch them .
I hope it &apos;s easier , unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
But things also change very quickly .
You &apos;ve all heard of things like Stuxnet worm .
So if you look at what Stexnet has done is injured this court .
That Criminal Court from Simens controlling a reasonable programmer .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
That &apos;s what runs everything around us .
The programmers are these little boxes that don &apos;t have a screen , no keyboard programmed and put in place and do their work .
For example , the elevator in this building is probably controlled by one of these .
And when Stex Nett has one of these great revolutions in the kind of danger that we should worry about .
Because everything around us is running this way .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Go to any factory , any power plant , any food plant , look around you , everything is run with computers .
Everything is run by computers .
Everything depends on these computers to work .
We &apos;ve become very dependent on the Internet for fundamental things like electricity on computers can work .
And that &apos;s really something that creates new problems for us .
We have to find a way to continue our work even if computers fail .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So Jazez means we can do things even if the things we take out of the Muslim things are not here .
It &apos;s actually very basic things to think about sustainability , thinking about backup thinking about things that really matter .
Now I tell you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I love it .
Think about all the services that we have on the Web .
Think if you take us if one day you don &apos;t really have a reason or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I worry that maybe we can &apos;t see that .
I worry that we &apos;re going to get inside problems because of cybercrime .
Cybercrime is something that can take these things from us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the web , and I feel that if we don &apos;t fight cybercrime , we risk its entire loss .
We have to do it globally , and we have to do it now .
What we need is a more global security force to find cybercrime gangs , these organized gangs that profit millions of their attacks .
That &apos;s more important than turning anti-retrovirals or protective walls .
What really matters is finding people behind these attacks and more importantly , we have to find people who are about to become part of this cybercrime world , but they haven &apos;t yet .
We have to find people with skills , but without opportunities , and give them opportunities to use their skills for good .
Thank you very much .

The world is changing very quickly .
If you look at this graph , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , the predictions of Goldman Sachs say that the Chinese economy is going to be almost the same as the U.S. economy .
And if you look at the graph of 2050 , you &apos;ll see that it shows that the Chinese economy is going to be twice as big as the U.S. economy and the Indian economy as well as the U.S. economy .
But we have to consider that these predictions were before the economic crisis in the Western markets .
Two weeks ago , I was looking at the new forecast that was released by BMW , which shows when the economy of China is going to cross the U.S. economy .
Goldman Sachs forecast was in 2027 .
And the post-crisis expectations are 2020 .
That &apos;s after one decade .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental concepts .
The first is that it &apos;s a gigantic developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people that have been growing for 30 years at a rate of 10 percent every year .
In one decade , the largest economy in the world will be .
It &apos;s never happened in the modern age , if the country has the largest economy in the world than the developing world , rather than the developed countries .
The second thing is that for the first time in modern history , the dominant state of the world will be , I think , China is a country in the east , not in the West , a country with very different cultural roots .
And I know that it &apos;s common in the West , I think that once countries develop , they can get the character of Western countries .
But that &apos;s an illusion .
Suppose modernity is only shaped by competition , markets and technology is a false assumption .
They also form by history and culture .
China is not a Western country , and it &apos;s not a Western country .
And it will remain with very different respect .
And the big question today is , how do we understand China ?
How are we going to absorb what China is ?
And the problem that &apos;s so common today is that we &apos;re trying to understand things from a Western perspective and using Western ideas .
That &apos;s wrong .
Now I want to show you three main stones to try to understand China as a beginning .
First of all , China is not a nation-state .
I &apos;ve called herself over the last hundred years , but anyone knows China knows it &apos;s much more powerful than that history .
This is China after the Queen scaffold in 221 BC , after a period of war , the birth of modern China .
And you can see that the border is different to the borders of China today .
And then came the Hyan Embra , and it was 2000 years ago .
And as you can see , most of what &apos;s known today in Eastern China , which is where most Chinese live today , and there &apos;s a greater number of Chinese .
Now what &apos;s remarkable about this is that what gives China the concept of China , what Chinese means is that the concept of China is not going to come from looking at the last hundred years , not from a period of nationalism , as it happens in the West , but from a period in which the state of civilization has been , if you will .
Now , old war clothes remind me of the unique state concepts of family relationships , like Johannesi , the concepts of Confucius .
And things like that came out of the age of civilization .
To make that clear , China is not like Western countries , and not like most countries in the world , it &apos;s shaped by the concept of civilization , but it &apos;s found in the sense of civilization rather than in the nation-state .
And another thing we can add to this is that we really know that China is a large geographic and demographic country with a population of 1.3 billion people .
And what we don &apos;t usually realize is the fact that China is so diverse and so many , and it &apos;s not central at all .
The Beijing power can &apos;t be simpled to this massive size , even if we think that &apos;s what happens .
It never happens .
Well , this is China , instead of a nation-state .
And what does this mean ?
That &apos;s a huge effect .
I &apos;m going to give you two of these implications .
The first is that the most important political concept of China is the unit of survival for Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe had been divided by the Roman Empire .
I &apos;ve come and I &apos;ve been divided since then .
And China , at this time , has exactly the opposite : trying to hold and maintain this huge civilization in parallel with the concept of the state .
The second thing , perhaps , is very innovative , is about Hong Kong .
Do you remember Tesla Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese constitution was .
One country , two systems .
And I bet everyone in the Western world really believed an idea .
There &apos;s an autonomous system .
When Hong Kong graduates under the power of China , it &apos;s not going to be so transformative after 13 years the political and justice system in Hong Kong is very different than it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . We missed .
Because we thought it was going to work in our view of the nation-state .
We thought it would happen in Germany in 1990 .
Remember what happened .
When the West swallowed the east .
One nation , one system .
This is the nationalism mindset .
But this mindset can &apos;t be pulled to China — it &apos;s a civilization — the principle of one civilization — one system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
China &apos;s response to the Hawking issue is the case of Taiwan , a natural response to one civilization , many systems .
Let me give you another basic stone to try to understand China , maybe a slightly strange stone .
Chinese have a very different notion of race compared to other countries .
Do you know that among 1.3 billion people in China , 90 percent of them belong to the same race ?
This is very different from most of the world &apos;s big population .
Like India , the United States of Indonesia , Brazil , all of these countries are made up of a mixture of race .
China is not .
China is multiethnic at the other end of the margins .
And the question is , why ?
The reason is , I think , fundamentally , is to go back to a civilization .
Maybe going back to 2,000 years to the era of possibility , war and merger and understanding that all of this has led over time to the nation of Han has naturally expanded because of its power , because of its own sense of authorization and cultural personality .
Going back to history and into experiments , we can see that the great benefit came from the idea that without the scaffolding , what China was to remain as coherent as it was .
The character of the Icelandic character was the link between this country together .
But the thing about this is that the hallucination has a very , very low notion of cultural diversity .
They really believe in their science that they don &apos;t respect other people who don &apos;t belong to their ancestry .
So for example , we can see their work with the Eagles and the Tibet .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the third fundamental stone of the Chinese country .
The relationship between the Chinese government and the Chinese community is very different from the West .
We &apos;re here in the West , fascinated by thinking about , at least in this age , that power and legislation that govern the country is a kind of democracy .
And the problem with this approach is that the Chinese government has more people and more power between Chinese than the governments in Western countries .
And the reason for that is that , in fact , there are two reasons .
They &apos;re not about democracy at all , because if we want to apply our terms , China is not going to stop democracy at all .
And the reason for that is that the country in China has a very special representation of whether it &apos;s parliament or government or state members of all forms of the Chinese culture .
And this is almost like China to a kind of spiritual role .
And the second reason , whether in Europe or in North America , power has always been in a situation where conflict means in the European tradition , history has been talking a lot about a struggle between church and the bureaucratic class , and for 1,000 years , the Chinese state power has not faced any challenge .
There is no important revolution .
So we can see the way power is formed in China , and it &apos;s very different from the way our power is shaped in Western history .
And the result is that China is a very different concept of government .
When we treat it as a fantasy or an alien , or as an entity , it needs to undermine its power , or it &apos;s restricted , Chinese don &apos;t see it that way .
The Chinese look at power as a partner , not just as a partner , but as a family member , not just as a member of the family , but as a family member , but as a member of the family .
This is the Chinese government view , and it &apos;s very different from our view .
And it &apos;s all about government , with people in a very different way than it is in the West .
And I want to show you my vision of what we &apos;re facing in the Chinese context today is a new model , which is different from what we &apos;re counting and what we thought .
We need to know that China believes in the market , in the country .
I mean , Adam Smith wrote in the late 18th century that the Chinese market was sophisticated and more organized than any market in Europe , far away from the time of Mo , which was a story in which it was similar , or different .
But in the general sense , there is a very strong country in many ways .
The government of China is everywhere .
I mean , it &apos;s driving companies that most companies are civil companies .
And private companies , no matter how big they are , like Linuvio , depend on many ways on government aid .
The economic goals are determined by government .
And the government extends its power into different areas , and we know each other like just one child &apos;s policy .
And more than that , it &apos;s a very old tradition of government construction .
I mean , if we look at the image of the construction , we see that the Great Wall of China is its meaning .
But there &apos;s another teacher . It &apos;s the great canal that started founded in the fifth century before Christmas .
And it ended up in the seventh century .
It extends about 114 miles to Beijing and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary infrastructure projects in China , which I think explains what we see today , like what we &apos;ve seen from the opening of the great three , and many of the facilities that the country is funded within China .
So these are the three basic stones to try to understand China , to disappear as a nation of one nation , and of course this nation is different from us , and its relationship with the different community .
And yet , largely , we think we can understand China by comparing it with a Western model and looking at it in Western eyes and in Western terms .
And if you want to know why we keep understanding China wrong , and our expectations are always wrong in what &apos;s happening there , in fact , that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I think , as I say , it &apos;s the impression of China , it &apos;s the European mindset .
It &apos;s the hubris .
It &apos;s a sense of transcendence , we think we are the best , and we are the global scale .
In other words , it &apos;s ignorance .
We refuse to confront the idea of difference between the East and the West .
You know , there &apos;s an interesting poverty in Paul Cohen &apos;s book .
Paul Cohen says that the West thinks of itself as the most globalized culture that can be applied to most cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many areas , it &apos;s the most limited in thought , because over the last 200 years , the West has been a dominant trajectory in the world , it doesn &apos;t have to understand the culture and the cultures of others .
Because she thought that Western culture could be empowered .
Even if we were to mean on the other side , all the other civilizations in the world that have been around for a long time in the face of western culture , which has forced Western culture to understand , because the West has been present in these communities .
And for that , as a result , the Eastern civilizations are much more universal than the West .
I mean , take , for example .
Eastern Asia : Japan , Korea , China , one third of the world lives there .
It &apos;s the most powerful economic area in the world today .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that people from East Asia know a lot about the West than the West knows about Eastern Asia .
And this is a very important point for the present .
Because of what &apos;s happening today , remember the graph , the Golden Sacks forecast scheme .
You see what happens very quickly , compared to history , the world is driven by developed countries , but by developing countries .
And we see this in the meetings of the top 20 countries , which are rapidly occupying the seventh largest , or the G8 countries .
And there are two consequences to this .
The first is that the West is losing very quickly the impact of the world .
And there was a clear representation of this last year , especially in Copenhagen at the climate change conference .
Europe didn &apos;t exist at the end of the conversation .
When has this happened before ?
Maybe over 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
And the second era is that the world will become , as a printer of what &apos;s going on today , will become a strange world for us , because it &apos;s being shaped by cultures and traditions and history , we don &apos;t know anything about it or ignorant about it .
And finally , I &apos;m afraid that Europe is a little different , but Europeans are widely engaged and unaware of the changes that are happening in the world today .
Some people say , &quot; &quot; Somebody &apos;s a British friend of mine in China says that the old continent is going to be mysterious about forgiveness , maybe that &apos;s true . That &apos;s probably too much .
But there &apos;s also a problem going forward with this problem that Europe is moving away from the perspective of the world and feeling the sense of the future .
I mean , Europe was at some point controlling the future .
Like what was going on in the 19th century .
But that &apos;s not true anymore .
And if you want to feel the future , to taste the future , you need China , the old Bonobos .
This is a train station ; it &apos;s something that has never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t look like a regular train station .
It &apos;s the new Ganghao train station for high-speed trains .
China has the largest train railroad network of any country in the world , and it will soon have more than all the railways in the world .
Now look at this idea , it &apos;s an idea that you &apos;re going to try soon in the suburbs of Beijing .
It &apos;s giant bus ; it &apos;s about 2,000 people on board .
You move on your railroad tracks and cars move inside .
And it &apos;s going 100 miles an hour .
And that &apos;s how things are going to go because China has a very different problem in Europe , and from the United States , China has a large number of people , a small area .
And this is the solution to this problem where it will apply to China in many , many cities that are over 20 million people .
So how am I going to end this talk ?
How do we go about the world that we see changes very quickly and cause us to do that ?
I think there will be answers and reasons for that .
But I want to say , though , there &apos;s a positive image of this .
Over 200 years , the world has essentially been ruled before a handful of people .
You live in Europe and North America .
And in the presence of countries like China and India , which have 38 percent of the world &apos;s population and countries like Indonesia and Brazil , that would mean real democratization for 200 years .
The cultures and cultures that we were ignoring , which were silent , which nobody knew anything about , are now being embedded in new places like the world .
As humans , they &apos;re completely welcome , and we need to learn about these cultures .
The giant ship , this is the one that Zeng was sailing in the early 1500s , in its big travels across the Southern and eastern Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
And the little boat in front of it was made 80 years later , which Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Now look very carefully at this magical sketch made by Zozo in 1368 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Oh my God , Chinese also invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
Now before you care , or you start singing , or choosing a better color , I want to identify what I mean by a revolution .
In the word of revolution , I mean radical and long-term change in the way we think and our behaviors — in the way we think and how we behave .
Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because things don &apos;t work ; they don &apos;t work very well .
And that makes me very sad , because I &apos;m tired and tired of things that don &apos;t work .
You know , I &apos;ve been tired and tired of us and we don &apos;t live our potential .
I was tired and tired of us and we were too late .
And we &apos;re at the last center of several things — for example , social factors .
We &apos;re at the last center in Europe in the area of innovation .
Here we are at the end completely , at the bottom , at the last concentration of density that does not value innovation .
We &apos;re at the latest center in medical care , and that &apos;s important to feel well-being .
And here we are , not just in the last center of the European Union , but the last in Europe , right down .
And worst of all , it was released three weeks ago , and most of you saw it , the Economist .
We &apos;re measuring a place on Earth , according to GDP statistics per capita — reflect a place on Earth .
This is socially , let &apos;s look at education .
Where was our category three weeks ago in another report from the OECD ?
The last center of reading , mathematics and science , the last center .
Business : The lowest percentage of the European Union .
Business provides community benefits .
Why is the result of this ? What &apos;s going on ?
Less than the entrepreneurs who start projects .
And that &apos;s regardless of the fact that all people realize that small businesses are the engine of the economy .
We run most people , and we create most taxes .
So if our engine crashes , guess what ?
The last center of GDP per capita is at the level of Europe .
The last one .
So it &apos;s not surprising , my friends , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , we have the worst business .
And these are facts , guys .
It &apos;s not a story , it &apos;s not a myth .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a conspiracy from me on Bulgaria . These are facts .
And so I think it should be clear , obviously , that our system is disruptive .
The way we think , the way we act , the system of how we act is broken .
We need radically changing the way we think and our behaviors to transform Bulgaria for the better , for us , for our friends , for our families and our future .
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to start positive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re at the last center because we — and it may be hard for some of you — because we &apos;re setting ourselves up .
We &apos;re preparing ourselves because we can &apos;t play .
I said play , right .
If you forget what play is , this is what play looks like .
Little kids play , kids play , adults play .
We can &apos;t play .
In fact , we underestimate the value of play .
And we reduce its value in three aspects .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three aspects .
Social : 45 years of what ?
It &apos;s communism from appreciating society and state above individual and right , about inadvertently , of creativity , expression of self in individuals and innovation .
In contrast , what do we value ?
Because obviously how to implement and generate and use knowledge is influenced by the social and institutional context that told us that communism is what ?
Being solemn .
Being very solemn .
I did .
( Applause ) Be solemn .
I can &apos;t remember how many times I was bathed in the garden because I let my kids play in the courtyard .
God forbid to play in mud , or dirty water , which will kill them .
I &apos;ve been told that we should not let our kids play a lot , because life is new and we should train them to life .
We have a serious belief going on between us .
It &apos;s a social knowledge that &apos;s going on between us .
He &apos;s a new knowledge .
It &apos;s 45 years of this that created what I call my father &apos;s agent . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Which works like this .
Step one : the woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to tear with a child . &quot; &quot; Step two : Get off with the baby . Wow !
And then what happens in the third step ?
I want to go back to my work , because I want to meet my job or I just want to go to coffee .
I &apos;m going to go to Becko to the father .
But we have to remember that this father has this new thought for 45 years .
So what happens ?
This virus transferred to the baby , and it takes a very long time — like the Red Forest — this new belief to come out of our operating system .
What happens next ?
It &apos;s about education where we have a disabled education system that has changed a spectrum over the last hundred years that value technical education , preservation and standard standards , and underestimate the expression of self-expression , self-discovery , wonder , creativity and play .
It &apos;s a deep system .
A real story : I went to search for a school for my children .
We went to that elite school and said they were going to study mathematics 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read five times a day and all these things .
And we said to them , &quot; &quot; Well , what about play and vacation ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Huh . There &apos;s no one moment in the table . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime .
And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious that education is so serious that we create autonomous robots to put a drill in holes that have been trust before .
I hope sorry , but today &apos;s problems are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
We need to adapt , and the ability to learn to become creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t want mechanical work .
But no , if we think pencil goes into the work that can &apos;t play .
We &apos;re creating robots and treating them as property , for the poor and then getting rid of them .
What are the characteristics of plague work ?
Ready — do what I &apos;m saying because I &apos;m the president .
I &apos;m the president and I see you .
It &apos;s about not trust — obviously you &apos;re a criminal , and so I &apos;m going to put the cameras .
( Laughter ) The control is obviously you &apos;re deep , and so I &apos;m going to put you some little procedures to follow so you don &apos;t get out of the way .
And they &apos;re restricted — don &apos;t use your lover , don &apos;t use your personal computer , don &apos;t look online , don &apos;t use instant messaging .
This is kind of bad and uninterested .
And at the end of the day , you &apos;re unsatisfied , because you &apos;re constrained and you &apos;re not appreciated and you don &apos;t get any fun .
In social development , in education and our work , they can &apos;t play .
And so we &apos;re late , because we don &apos;t give value to play .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; This is a ridiculous speech , Steve . What a stupid idea .
It can &apos;t be because of entertainment .
It &apos;s just playing , that &apos;s ridiculous . We have the power of this social thought .
Well , I &apos;ll say no .
And I &apos;ll prove that to you in the next part of this slide — that play is the motivation , is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria into the best .
Text : Our brains are ready to play .
Evolution has chosen , over millions of years , many play patterns of animals and humans .
You know something ?
Evolution has done a good job , very good , to abolish the unappropriate qualities for us and identify the right qualities of the competitive advantage .
Nature is not stupid , and it selected entertainment .
Through the animal kingdom , for example , ants , ants play .
You probably didn &apos;t know this .
But when he plays , he learns the social system , the movement of things .
The rats play , but what you might not know is that rats that play a lot more brains and learn tasks better , skills .
Cats play , and we all know cats play .
But what you might not know is that cats that deprive play , they can &apos;t socially communicate .
They can always hunt , but they can &apos;t deal with the social ocean .
The bears play .
But what you might not know , the bears that play more live longer .
It &apos;s not the bears that learn to catch fish better .
But the ones that play more .
And this is another interesting study , which proved , that there &apos;s a huge connection between play and brain size .
The more you play , the bigger the brain is .
Dolphins , with big brains , play a lot .
But who do you think of big brains who play more ?
You are , indeed , the human .
Children play , we all play whatever our gender is , our race , our colors , our data .
Play is a unified global thing , we all play .
Not only kids play , adults also play .
There &apos;s a nice term : nanotechnology , which is to keep the properties of play and small in adults .
How many of them are the Newtonian ?
Humans . We play sports .
We do it for fun , or Olympic games , or as professionals .
We play with instruments .
We dance , we sing , we act like crazy .
We &apos;ve been trained to play since birth to a very advanced age .
We were forced to do this all the time — to play and play too much and not stop playing .
It has a huge benefit .
And there &apos;s also a benefit to animals , there &apos;s also a benefit to the human being .
For example , I &apos;ve shown that play motivates the growth of neurons in the amygdala , in the region that controls emotions .
It also proved that it motivates the evolution of the cortex before the frontal cortex where cognitive ability is concentrated .
And as a result of this ? What happens ?
We &apos;re developing our emotional model more if we play more .
We develop better decision-making capabilities if we play more .
That &apos;s a reality .
It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not fictional stories , it &apos;s a constant science and it &apos;s true .
These are the benefits of play .
It &apos;s our genetic right , as we walk or see or hear .
If we admire ourselves from play , we embrace ourselves as if we do with any other genetic right .
We worry about progress .
This is a simple exercise for a few seconds : blink your eyes and try to imagine a world without fun .
Imagine a world without theater , without art , without song , without dance , without football , without laughter .
What would this world look like ?
Very resistant .
Very depressing .
Now imagine where you work .
Is it fun ? Massive ?
Or maybe where your friends work — we &apos;re now thinking further .
Is it fun ? Massive ?
Or is it a place where the salt is fed , authoritarian , control , complexity , undisease , unaffordable ?
We have that concept that the paradox of entertainment is action .
We even feel guilty if we &apos;re going to play during work .
&quot; Oh , my colleagues and I laughed , they must have thought I didn &apos;t have a lot of work , &quot; or , &quot; Oh , I have to hide so that my boss doesn &apos;t see me . &quot;
He would think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have some news for you : we thought this was my return .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play .
It &apos;s depression , it &apos;s depression .
In fact , play helps improve our work .
Like there are benefits to humans and animals , there are benefits to play in work .
For example , it motivates creativity .
Our openness for change increases .
It improves our ability to learn .
It makes us realize the temptation of things , and by perfecting — and they &apos;re the key motivators that raise productivity in work , through play .
So before you think about play , play doesn &apos;t mean trivial .
You know that professional sports that like skiing , is serious about this , but he loves it .
They enjoy their time , they go through the threads or skip on the slope .
The doctor may look serious , but laughter is still a great drug .
We thought back and forth .
We shouldn &apos;t feel guilty .
We have to celebrate play .
A quick example from the business world .
PJ : A simple slogan : people , service , profit .
If you treat people as people , if you treat them very well , they &apos;re happier , satisfied , and they feel meaningful and creative .
What happens ? They lead a better service — not worse , but better .
When customers call the company for a service , they deal with happy employees , they can make their decisions , and they &apos;re satisfied , what does customers feel ? They feel great .
Then , what do these clients do , who felt that great sense ?
They call you to buy another service , and they tell their friends that , which leads to more profits .
People , service , profit .
Play increases productivity , and it doesn &apos;t lack it .
You might say to me , &quot; &quot; Hey , this is possible in FedEx , there in the United States , not here in Bulgaria .
No way , we &apos;re totally different . &quot; &quot; This is possible , in Bulgaria , you have , for two reasons .
First of all , entertainment is universal .
What &apos;s weird about Bulgarians of entertainment , if we invest that collective thinking that we need to get rid of .
Secondly , because I tried , I tried in St.
I went there , we didn &apos;t have any happy customer .
It wasn &apos;t a single customer to buy our work .
I asked them all .
We had marginal profit — I did .
We had marginal profits , and our partners were unsettled .
Through some fundamental changes , changes , like improving transparency , changes , like encouraging self-directive and cooperation , encouraging cooperation , not authoritarian , but the nature of work underpins focus on outcomes .
I don &apos;t care when I came to work in the morning , or when I left .
What I &apos;m interested in is that your clients and your team are happy and you &apos;re organized around this .
Why should I care if I came to work at 9 a.m. ?
Basically promoting fun .
By promoting pleasure , and a great job space , we were able to transform St. and in a short period of about three years — it looks like a long time , but the change is slow — to a company that all customers are doing , when no one has ever done it before , plus we &apos;ve reached the profit rate in the sector and secreted partners .
Now you can ask , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you know that they &apos;re secreted ? Well , we &apos;ve won , over the years we &apos;ve been working , with one of the best jobs in the class of small companies .
And this is an independent analysis of employees who didn &apos;t explain their names on surveillance investments .
This is possible , and it can work in Bulgaria .
Nothing can distinguish us , but our mindset of entertainment .
So these are some of the steps that we can take — to finish the subject — how we can revolutionize play .
First , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , well , go home and think about it a little bit .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t have that feeling of wanting to play and entertainment , you have to rediscover them .
Whatever it was when you were a kid , you were enjoying , but now when you got a promotion , you couldn &apos;t enjoy it , but now when you got a promotion , you couldn &apos;t enjoy it , because you felt you had to be serious , you found it again .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about riding a bicycle on a mountain , reading a book , playing a game .
He discovered it again , because you are leaders , leaders of regeneration , leaders of thinking .
Because you have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite change in the play revolution .
You have to do this , and if you don &apos;t feel this , your colleagues and your employees can &apos;t feel it .
You have to go back to work , and say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll trust you . &quot; &quot; A weird concept . I hired you . I have to trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions , eat you some tasks , and I &apos;m going to give you some authorities to the lower levels , rather than the top .
I &apos;m going to encourage the construction critic .
You could challenge power .
Because by identifying the ways in which we can break the protein that we live in and create creative solutions for today &apos;s problems .
As leaders , we &apos;re not always right .
We &apos;re going to eliminate fear .
Fear is the enemy of entertainment .
And we &apos;re going to do some things like removing constraints .
You know something , let them use their phones to make personal conversations — God forbid .
Let them use the Internet .
Let them enter into robotic conversation sites .
Let them take longer for food .
Food is a scandal of work .
When you go out to the world , and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you eat a drink , you eat food , you talk , you get some interconnected ideas that you haven &apos;t had before .
Let them do that , give them some liberty , and generally , let them climb , let them enjoy where they work .
We spend most of our lives , in our workplace , and you &apos;re supposed to be what ? A miserable kitchen even after 20 years from now , you &apos;re going to wake up , and say , &quot; Is that all ? &quot;
&quot; Is that all it was ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; Nebryhilliff .
( Laughter ) And in short , we need a radical change in the way we think and our behavior , but we don &apos;t need a business revolution .
We don &apos;t need a business revolution .
What we need is the play spill . What we need is the sprawl of the players . What we need is the gamers .
I &apos;m serious now , we have to be a team together . Today is the beginning of the Intifada , but what we need to do . It &apos;s the creation of the revolution . You have to share with everybody your success stories .
It &apos;s about what was so good at reinventing our lives , our schools , our work through entertainment , about how entertainment enhances the sense of hope and self-fulfillment ; reinforces regeneration and productivity ; and finally , how play creates meaning .
And because we can &apos;t do this alone , we have to do it together , and together if we do that , and share these ideas about entertainment , we can change Bulgaria to the best .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , I want to start by introducing free advice , and all you need is this : change your body posture for two minutes .
But before I give you my advice , I want to ask you now to look at your body and see what you &apos;re doing with it .
Well , how many of you are shrinking on your body and looking smaller ?
Sometimes we hold our arms like this .
Sometimes we expand our comfort . ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want you to notice very well what you &apos;re doing now .
So , we &apos;re very fascinated by the language of the body , and we &apos;re particularly interested .
You know , we &apos;re interested in strange things like — ( Laughter ) with embarrassing motion or smile , or with a glue of temptation or maybe a very strange mystery , or maybe we care about something like a lighter .
Narrator : Here they got to 10 Dunning Street , and look at this .
Even the BBC and the New York Times .
So it &apos;s clear that when we think about non-verbal expression or body language — but we call it non-verbal expressions as sociologists . It &apos;s a language itself , we think about communication .
And when we think about communication , we think about interaction .
And there are a lot of reasons why we think this is a way .
And we produce inclusive stories and we argue a lot about what &apos;s around us through the language of the body .
And through these judgments , we can predict significant results in our lives like hiring or throwing out or asking for a date .
For example , Nelini Ebadi , a researcher at the University of Tavis , pointed out that when people watch 30 seconds of recorded clips without voice , from the real interaction between the doctor and the patient , their governor at the level of the doctor &apos;s kindness indicates whether this doctor is interviewed or not .
If you &apos;re not using them a little bit — that &apos;s a bad idea , right ?
We &apos;re also influenced by our non-verbal expressions , our ideas , our emotions and our physiological functions .
So what are the nonverbal expressions I &apos;m talking about ?
I &apos;m a psychologist and I study prejudice and prejudice , and I teach at one of the big business schools , so it was inevitably that I would be interested in simplicity .
And I became particularly interested in the non-verbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are the nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s about scale .
So you inflate yourself and you expand , you occupy space , and you basically open up .
So it &apos;s about openness , and that &apos;s true .
This expression is known as the pride I studied by Jaska Trey , and it shows that .
We &apos;re smaller than our size , and we don &apos;t want to engage with those next to us .
And that &apos;s what happens when you have high power .
If someone is there , they deal with us strongly , we tend to make ourselves smaller , we don &apos;t kill them .
And I see this behavior in the classroom , what did I notice ? I noticed that MBA students .
And when they sit down , they sort of spread out .
And you have other people actually collapse when they enter , and once they enter , you can see this collapse .
I &apos;ve noticed two things about this behavior .
Women often do these behaviors more than men .
Women always feel stronger and stronger than men . So that wasn &apos;t surprising , but there was something else I noticed .
And this is very important in the MBA class , because half of the end class depends on participation .
Business management mechanisms suffer this gap between gender grades .
So I started to wonder , you know , well we have these guys coming in this way .
There &apos;s evidence that it affects .
For example , we smile when we feel happy , but also when we force to smile when we grab the pen with our teeth like this , that makes us feel happy .
And the same is true of our sense of strength .
So the second question was , you know , we know that our brains change and affect our bodies , but is it true that our bodies change and affect our minds ?
And when I say minds , in this case of power , what exactly am I talking about ?
So how do powerful people &apos;s minds differ versus ?
The powerful people tend to be , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not surprising , &quot; &quot; much more confident and optimistic .
They actually feel that they &apos;re going to win even in accidental and fortunate things .
So there &apos;s a lot of variations . They &apos;re more risk .
But actually , power is also about how we act with stress .
So do you want that leader to be the dominant force , and the Testone ratio ratio , but you respond to stress ?
Probably not , right ? You want to be a diagnostic .
So we have this evidence , that just like the body can form the brain , at least on the surface , these basic changes can shape the brain .
So what happens , well , take a change role , what happens if you do this thing at a very simple level , like this simple manipulation , this simple intervention ?
Here &apos;s another couple .
So it could be realistic or sitting .
And here &apos;s the weak power situation .
So you involve yourself , you make yourself smaller .
You touch your neck .
So that &apos;s what happened , they come .
And that &apos;s it . This was the whole experience .
And this is what we came up with for the Stone .
So again , two minutes , and you can get these changes .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to get for Cortisol . People with great power .
So it seems that our non-verbal language is actually controlling and not just the direction of others , but even ourselves .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
I mean , that &apos;s what any situation you get to a social threat , where you get evaluated .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s about you , by talking to yourself , what do you do ?
Well , that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . It &apos;s filmed through it .
So for five minutes , nothing , and that &apos;s worse than being interrupted with speech .
People hate this . This is what Marian Lawrence calls .
Then we made programmers look at these recordings , four of them .
And the programmers were completely ignored for the hypothesis , and they ran the circumstances .
It &apos;s about the appearance they showed during the talk .
These things . People get what they really are .
So that &apos;s what moves the effect , or what connects the effect .
So I was telling them , protesting it until you embrace it . I don &apos;t want it . That &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then I feel like I &apos;m getting sick .
I don &apos;t want to feel like I &apos;m a prosecutor .
It happened when I was nine years old , when I had a very bad car accident .
I threw out of the car , and I graduated several times .
I threw out of the car , and I woke up , and I got my head .
And I was aware of a smart degree , because I was determined that I was smart and they were throwing me talent and I was a child .
So I was separated from college , and I kept trying to go back to it .
And they said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t finish college .
I &apos;m contagious .
You &apos;re going to stay , and all you have to do is .
I became what I wanted , I really do , so that &apos;s what I did , I spent five years at university .
I no longer feel that again , but it feels that , and I know how it feels .
She can pretend that , until she becomes that .
So she changed .
And what I want to tell you . Don &apos;t pretend to do it .
They pretend to be .
Do it enough to be , and you understand it .
And the last thing I want to leave you with is this .
Little modifications can lead you to great changes .
So it &apos;s just two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s what you have to do . Hold your brain .
Make the testosterone go up . Make the cartoon go down .
Don &apos;t let the situation feel like , oh , I didn &apos;t see them who I was .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Good creativity , sometimes , we need it .
Speaking . Good creativity is staggering , ridiculous , irrational .
Beautiful creativity can spread tolerance and freedom and make education look like a glamorous idea .
( Laughter ) Good creativity can highlight deprivation or make it useless .
Good creativity can make politicians elected , or parties unwanted .
It can make war look like a tragedy or a comic play .
Creativity is like a pen that writes logos on our shirts or phrases on our lips .
It &apos;s the explorer that shows us the simple way through the spiritual maze .
Science is smart , but good creativity is less common , more magical — and that &apos;s what we need now .
That &apos;s when he needs it .
Our climate is changing very rapidly , very fast .
And good creativity is required to do what is qualified for him : to think differently with the creative grapes .
The temptation to behave differently with exhilarating creative institutions .
This is one of them , a initiative from me that used creativity to motivate people to be friends of the environment .
Video : Man : You know , instead of driving today , I &apos;m going to walk .
Narrator : And he walked , as he saw things .
Strange , wonderful things that he didn &apos;t see .
My shadow broke his leg , a motorcycle flying .
The father and his daughter separates them from the bike , a strange wall .
And then he stopped , and she passed in front of him .
The woman I came up with was a little kid and broke her heart .
Of course , I grew up a little bit .
In fact , I grew up a lot .
But he felt all his old ambition to come back .
Ford , calling her kindly , was her name .
She said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Jesse ... &quot; &quot; That was his name .
I know a tent next to the camp , 300 yards away from here .
Let &apos;s go there and do love . I finished Ford .
And I put her in there while I photographed him , because she was on photography .
The Earth belonged to each other .
And they lived together , happy forever .
Because he decided to walk that day .
( Applause ) Andy Hopplum : We had science , and we had a discussion .
The inspirational thing is on the table .
Good creativity is required to make it simple and interruptive .
He gets to people . He gets them to act .
This is a call , and he came to the talented TED community .
Let &apos;s hire creativity against climate change .
Let &apos;s do it sooner . Thank you !

BL : Well , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
Well , I &apos;m going to count , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
Well , one , two , three . Audience : Can you read this ?
PL : Amazing . And what about this ? One is two . Audience : You &apos;re not reading this .
PL : All right . One is two . ( Laughter ) If you &apos;re a Portuguese , right ? What about this ? One is three .
Audience : What do you read ?
PL : What are you reading ? There are no words .
I said , read what you see . Right ?
He literally says , &quot; &quot; Ow or Ray ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
And that &apos;s what should be said . Right ? Why is that ?
Because perception is based on our experience .
Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes sense , which means we never see what &apos;s there , and we never see the information , we just see what was useful to see in the past .
Okay ? What it means is that when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) Right ? He &apos;s getting information . He &apos;s making useful behavior . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Oh ! Oh ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) PL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go on our way , we get a little upset , right ?
But here we &apos;re talking about perception , right ?
And consciousness represents everything we think and know , and we believe in it , our hopes , our dreams and clothes that we wear , fall in love , everything starts to realize .
Now if perception is based on our history , it means that we just respond to what we &apos;ve done before .
But in fact , that &apos;s a huge problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
Now , I want to tell you a story about vision differently , and all the new perceptions that start the same way .
It starts with a question .
And the problem with questions is that it creates a question .
Now , skepticism is very bad . It &apos;s evolutionary terms that it &apos;s bad . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s predator , it &apos;s going to be very late .
Right ? ( Laughter ) Even sea turnaround is a consequence .
Right ? If you go down on a boat , your inner ears tell you you &apos;re moving . And your eyes , because they &apos;re moving with the boat , you say you &apos;re standing there .
Your brain can &apos;t deal with that kind of information , so it gets sick .
The question &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you to doubt .
And yet , the paradox is that the only way we can ever do anything new is step into this space .
So how can we ever do something new ? Well luckily , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And we &apos;ve been able to address even the hardest questions , the best questions are the ones that create the biggest tax .
It &apos;s the ones that complain about the things that we think are true . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how life begins , or what extends to beyond the universe , but to ask what you think is really true is to enter that space .
So what is the answer of evolution to the problem of doubt ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not just a process . Play experts will tell you that it &apos;s actually a lifestyle .
Play is one of the human endeavors where doubt is actually inevitable ; doubt is what makes play fun .
Right ? It &apos;s adapted to change . Right ? It opens up possibility , and it &apos;s collaborative . It &apos;s actually our way of social connectedness , and it &apos;s fundamentally driven . What that means is that we play a game . Play is the payoff of itself .
Now if you look at these five ways of life , these are exactly the same ways you need to be a good world .
Science is not defined by the curriculum in scientific research .
It &apos;s actually a lifestyle , it &apos;s here , and it &apos;s true of everything creative .
If you add rules to play , you have a game .
And that &apos;s actually what the experience is .
So , armed with these two ideas , that science is a lifestyle , and that experiences are games , we wondered , could anyone become a scientist ?
Who better to ask him from 25 children by eight to 10 ?
Because they &apos;re a play experts . So I took a bee cell to a small school in Devon , and the goal of that was not just to get kids to look at science differently , but to see themselves differently through the curriculum of science . Right ?
And the first step was to ask a question .
Now , I would say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because scientists said that little kids couldn &apos;t give a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said that children couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So , here are some questions . I put them in a little book so you don &apos;t even play yourself reading them . The point is that five of the questions that children put were actually the basis of scientific publications in the last five to 15 years . Right ?
So they were asking important questions for experts .
Now here , I want to share the wood with a very special person , right ?
It was one of the young people who participated in this study , and it &apos;s now one of the smallest scientists that has ever been published in the world . Right ? It &apos;s going to be now , once you get to the stage , the smallest person ever talks at TED . Right ?
Now , science and asking questions about courage .
Now it &apos;s the embodiment of courage , because it &apos;s going to stand here , and talk to you all .
Well Aimee , please prefer me . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Aimee &apos;s going to help me tell the story what we call the Plato Bee Plato project , and first I &apos;m going to tell you the question that you think about , prefer Aimee .
AM : Thank you , Bo . We thought it was easy to see the connection between humans and monkeys in the way we think , because we look equally .
But we wondered if there was a possibility of a relationship with other animals , it would be amazing if humans and bees were thinking similarly , that it seemed very different from us .
So we thought about whether humans and bees could solve complex problems the same way .
Really , we wanted to know if bees could also adapt themselves to new cases using previously labeled rules . What if bees could think like us ?
Well , that would be amazing , because we &apos;re talking about an insect that only has a million brain cells .
It &apos;s actually going to make sense that you can , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of today , light , weather , or from any angle close to it . ( Applause ) PL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids designed this experiment , and so — well , it &apos;s a game — Aimee , can you tell us what the game was , and the honeybees ?
EA : The puzzle we came up with was the &quot; &quot; if &quot; &quot; rule &quot; &quot; base .
We asked bees to learn not only to go to a particular color , but to a particular color flower when you &apos;re in a particular pattern .
They were only paid if they went to yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
There are many different rules that bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question was , you know ?
What was really exciting about this project was that , Bob , he had no idea whether this would work .
It was completely new , and nobody had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) PL : including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a world to continue and have no idea what it &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — a lot of you come back to Dave Straduinck , which was the collaborator in this project . Okay ?
So I &apos;m not going to go into the full details of the study because you can actually read about it , but the next step is to observe . Here are some students doing observations , and they &apos;re recording data where bees fly .
( Video ) DF : So what are we going to do — Student 5 .
DR : Are you still going up here ? Student : Yes .
DR : Well , watch both . Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
PL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist says that , right ?
Student : There are two there .
And three here .
PL : Right ? So we have our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
They do simple mathematics , on average , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this , and try to send it to publication . Right ? So we have to write it .
And so we did , of course , go to the pub . Right ? ( Laughter ) The glass on the left is my kingdom , right ? ( Laughter ) Now , I told them , the research has four different sections : a front and a show of methods and results and discussions .
The front speaks about the question and why ?
And show the methods of what we did ? The results , what was the observation ?
And the discussion , who cares ? Right ?
That &apos;s scientific research , basically . ( Laughter ) So kids gave me words , right ? And I put it in a narrative context , which means that this paper is written in children &apos;s language .
I &apos;m not a writer . It &apos;s written by Aimee and other students in class . As a result , this scientific paper starts like this , &quot; &quot; Whatever ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section says , &quot; &quot; The training phase , the puzzle — ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And he shows methods , he says , &quot; &quot; And then we put bees in the refrigerator and we make bees , right ? ( Laughter )
Well this is the title page . We have a number of authors there .
All of those in the broad line are those who are eight to 10 years old .
The first author is &quot; &quot; The Old School of Plakton , &quot; &quot; because if it &apos;s ever been referred to it , it &apos;s going to be &quot; &quot; Plato and others . &quot; &quot; And not one individual . So we sent it to a public circulation , and they said this . They said a lot of things , but he said this .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the scientific paper did not reach our initial quality standards in many different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it begins with the phrase &quot; Whatever it is , &quot; &quot; and the paintings were in the coloring pens , etc . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to review them . So we went to Porsche , which is in &quot; &quot; The National Academy of Science , one of the great neuroscientists , &quot; &quot; which is absolutely the most famous one — ( Laughter )
Larry Maloney , the vision expert , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is fantastic .
And the work is going to be publishing if adults do it . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sent it back to the editor .
They said no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Humble to write a commentary that puts results to scientists , right , by putting reference , and presenting it to biology messages .
And there , it was reviewed by five independent governors , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took us four months to do the scientific side , two years to publish it . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s folding in science , actually , right ? And that makes Aimee and her youngest publish-publishing scientists in the world .
What were the reactions ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , it was downloaded for 30,000 times a day one , right ?
It was the choice of editors in Sinos , a classified scientific journal .
It &apos;s accessible to free access by biology messages .
It &apos;s the only scientific paper that will be available for free by this cycle .
Last year , the second most popular scientific paper was in &quot; &quot; Biology messages , &quot; &quot; and comments were not only by scientists , but teachers and the public as well .
I &apos;m just going to read one .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;ve read &quot; &quot; Plato Plakton recently . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have words to describe what I &apos;m feeling now .
What you did , real guys , healthy and humiliating .
Curiosity , attention , innocence and enthusiasm are the basis and one of the most important things to do with science .
And who doesn &apos;t have those characteristics ?
Please give your kids a call on me . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I try it for you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah . OK . OK .
Now , science is associated with risk , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve done this once . ( Laughter ) And you love technology , right ?
SM : Yeah , but I love myself .
PL : This is an example of technology . Right . Okay .
Now — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to show you a little demo , right ?
You have to sink your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . Okay ?
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Okay , what if all the audience screamed there . One is three ?
Audience : ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) Perfect . Now , open your eyes . And you &apos;ll do it again .
Everybody there screaming . ( Screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What is the experience ? The experience is what science does to us .
Right ? We usually live our lives responsive , but if we ever want to do something different , we have to step towards doubt . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
And that &apos;s what science provides to us . It provides the possibility to step towards suspicion by the play process , right ?
Now , I think the true education of science has to be associated with giving people a voice and empowering them to express that voice , and so I asked Aimee to be the last sound in this short story .
Well , Aimee ?
EA : This project was really exciting to me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it turns out that anybody , and I mean anyone , has the ability to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a big discovery .
Changing the way someone thinks about something can be easy or hard . Everything stops the way someone feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was astonishingly easy , once we played games and then I started thinking about this puzzle , I realized then that science wasn &apos;t just a boring topic , that anybody could discover something new .
I just needed an opportunity . I had the opportunity in the form of asthma , and the Plakton honeybees project .
Thank you . PL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I want to talk about is actually the biggest problems in the world .
And I &apos;m not going to talk like the environmentalists talk about , and I think that &apos;s a good option .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;m going to talk about what these big problems are facing our world .
And I have to ask you , before I start , I have to ask each of you personally to find a heart and a paper because I &apos;m going to ask you to help with this .
So bring a paper and a pen .
We all know that there are a lot of problems in this world .
And I &apos;m going to show you a few of them .
There are 800 million hungry people around the world .
There are a billion people living without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation services .
And several million people have HIV .
And the list grows up .
And it &apos;s estimated that two billion people will suffer from climate change and so on .
There are many , many problems in the outside world .
And in a perfect world , we &apos;re going to solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t really solve all these problems .
And yet , we have to ask ourselves a question — as long as we &apos;re restricted by financial constraints — we can say , if we can &apos;t solve all these problems , what &apos;s the first problem we have to start solving first ?
And that &apos;s the question I want to ask you .
So if we have , 50 billion dollars now , how are we going to spend in the next four years to benefit the world around us , where are we going to spend it and what ?
I &apos;ve identified 10 big problems facing our world , and I &apos;m going to read it briefly to you , which is climate change , infectious diseases , conflict , economic crisis , government corruption , nutrition , hunger , population migration , water shortage , financial impairment and trade barriers .
I think this is generally the biggest problem in the world around us .
And the obvious question here is , what are the most important problems ?
And which one should we start trying to solve ?
But that &apos;s wrong .
And this was the real problem that we had in Davos in January .
Because of course , there &apos;s a problem to get people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve it .
Of course , the biggest problem in the world is that we are artists and we will die someday .
And because you have the technology to solve that , right ?
So the point I &apos;m trying to get to is not to classify problems in terms of their importance but to classify solutions to those problems .
And that would — of course that would make it more complicated .
To solve the climate change problem , the answer would be to make the world like Kieto , a city in Japan .
To solve the problem of infectious diseases , the answer is health centers , or bed nets .
And for conflict , the answer will be the U.N. forces to keep peace and so on .
And what I want you now is to try , in 30 seconds — and I know it &apos;s an impossible logic — to write on the paper what you think is one of the most important priorities .
And also — that , of course , even though it &apos;s evil — what are the things we should not do , at least first .
What problem should be at the end of the priorities list ?
Please , just 30 seconds , you can talk to people next to you , and try to figure out what are the most important priorities and what are the least important issues that we should consider the most important problems that need to solve in our world .
The amazing part of this stage — and of course , I mean , I would — I only have 18 minutes , and I gave you a good split of my time , right ?
I want you to engage with me , to realize what this mechanism is , and that &apos;s exactly what we did .
And I highly encourage you to this , and I &apos;m sure we can discuss this later , to think together , how do we prioritize these priorities ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself first , why is this list not really there on the ground ?
And the only reason is that priorities are often uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do that .
Of course , every organization wants to be at the top of the list .
But it &apos;s at the same time that it hate not to be on the top of the list .
And as long as there are many problems that don &apos;t first occupy the list and that there are only one organization that will be on the list , it makes sense that we don &apos;t do a list like we &apos;re talking about .
For example , we have the U.N. for 60 years , but we haven &apos;t done a real list of big problems that we want to change in this world , and we haven &apos;t identified , which of those things we need to do at the beginning ?
But that doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no category of things around us — because any single iPod decision itself is classified , of course we still classify . If that &apos;s only done — and that &apos;s not good enough if we actually identified those priorities , and we discussed them and talked about them .
So I propose that we imagine that we have , for a long time , a problem when we had a list of choices .
There &apos;s so much , what we can do , but we didn &apos;t have the cost , we didn &apos;t even have the measurements required .
We had no idea about them .
So imagine you &apos;re in a restaurant and you have a big food list , but you don &apos;t know how much food there is .
You can ask pizza because it &apos;s on the list , but you don &apos;t know what it costs .
It could be one dollar , it could be 1,000 dollars .
And it might be a family size , or it &apos;s just one chip , right ?
We all want to know these things : cost and volume .
And that &apos;s what Copenhagen was trying to do as he was making these issues .
And basically that &apos;s all Copenhagen &apos;s meeting tried to do .
He made the most important 30 economists in the world , three out of every field .
So we had the best three economists to write about climate change .
And figure out what can you do ? What is the cost of this work ? What are its obstacles and benefits to it ?
And so in the field of infectious diseases .
Three of the most important experts to tell us , what should we do ?
And what does this work cost ?
And how do we treat the problem , what are the odds and the obstacles ?
And so ...
And then we made some of the best economists in the world , eight of them specifically , including three Nobel Prize winners , met in Copenhagen in May of 2004 .
We called them the Dream team , and the University of Cambridge decided to call them the Ryal Economic team .
And the name was good in Europe , but he didn &apos;t get that sense here .
And what this particular team did was to go out on a priority list .
And then you ask , why are the economists ?
And I &apos;m , of course , very happy because you asked this question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very important question .
The idea , of course , is that if you want to know something about malaria , you ask good news about malaria .
And if you want to know something about the climate , you &apos;re going to ask news about it .
But if you want to know which of those things you have to first treat , you can &apos;t ask any of them , because it &apos;s not their work .
And that &apos;s what economists do .
They limit priorities .
They don &apos;t like most , what should you care about first , and what should you do next ?
And here &apos;s the list , which they came out of , which I want to share with you .
Of course , you can also look at it with the email address , and we &apos;ll talk about it a little bit later on this day .
They actually went out on a list where they said there were several abundant projects — basically , projects that had invested one dollar , getting out of them .
And there are balanced projects , there are profitable and some very profitable projects .
And of course , that very profitable is the one we should start with .
And I &apos;m going to start with you from the bottom of the list to end with very successful projects .
And these were the projects in their view .
And you can see , climate change is in the tail of the list .
And that might be bad for many people , which is one of the things that causes people to not trusted again , too .
And I &apos;m going to talk about this , because it &apos;s really interesting .
Why did climate change come here ?
And I &apos;m going to try to come back to this later also because it &apos;s often one of the things that we &apos;re going to differ from the list that you wrote before .
What made them say that making the world as a city of Kyoto — or a better job than Kyoto — is simply a loser because it &apos;s an inefficient way .
They &apos;re not saying that climate change is not really happening .
It &apos;s not a big problem either .
But they say that what you can do about that is relatively small , for the cost of the problem .
What they showed us , most of the economic models combined , is that if you adopt the Kyoto solution , if everybody agreed , the cost would be about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a lot of money .
It &apos;s actually about two to three times the amount of global development that normally acts to the third world every year .
It &apos;s only going to affect a very good job .
And the conservative model of the problem says that this amount will stop global warming for six years since 2100 .
So , the person who lives in Bangladesh can avoid another six years of debris .
Which is good , but it &apos;s not good enough .
And the idea I &apos;m trying to communicate to you is , we &apos;re going to spend in this case a lot of money compared to the expected achievement .
And we can see how big that number is when we know , the United Nations only estimate half of that money , which is about 75 billion dollars a year , to solve most of the big problems in the world .
That money can provide clean water , good sanitation and basic health services as well as educating everyone on this planet .
So we can ask ourselves , again , do we want to spend twice that much money doing a little bit of good achievement ?
Or should we just spend half of it in order to do a huge amount of accomplishments ?
And that &apos;s why the climate problem became a losing project .
That doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not going to fix this problem , if enough resources are available .
But we &apos;re saying that right now it &apos;s not among the most priorities of economic values .
And the fair projects — and I &apos;m not going to commit all of these — but the problem of infectious diseases , appropriate health services — I made them simple , yes , the size of basic health services is a great thing .
This is going to provide a very large service , but it &apos;s also very expensive .
And again , this tells us that it &apos;s our beginning to think carefully about this equation .
And if we look at successful projects , we find that water and sanitation projects are going to appear on the list .
And it &apos;s true that water and sanitation is very important , but it takes a lot of infrastructure .
So I want to show you the first four priorities that we have to start addressing immediately when we talk about how to deal with problems in the world .
So the problem of malaria kills the fourth center — dealing with malaria .
That infects about two million people every year .
That could cost up to one percent of the GDP every year of the countries with it .
But if we invest 13 billion dollars in the next four years , the rate of infection will halve .
And we &apos;re going to save half a million people of death , and most importantly , we &apos;re going to avoid nearly a billion people being infected every year .
That will increase their ability to deal with other problems that we have to deal with surrounding them , and of course , in the long run to deal with global warming .
The third center is free trade .
And this model suggests that if we can liberate trade , and especially stop the support for commodities in the United States and Europe , we will be investing in the global economy as a very large number of 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of it will come back to the Third World .
Again , the importance here is that we can raise about 2- 3 million people of extreme poverty , rapidly , within a period of two to five years .
And that &apos;s going to be the third best thing we can do .
The second best thing we can do is focus on malnutrition .
Not just malnutrition in general , but also in a cheap way to deal with malnutrition , the season , the lack of basic needs in food .
Basically , almost half the world suffers from a lack of iron , zinc , hand and vitamin A.
And if we invest 12 billion dollars , that will make a huge impact on the problem and solve it .
So this is the second best thing to do .
The best thing to intervene is to focus on HIV .
And if we invest about 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we will protect almost 28 million AIDS .
And again , this is to say that there are two ways of dealing with HIV .
The first is treatment , the second is prevention .
And in a perfect world we can do both things together .
But in a world that doesn &apos;t do anything at all , or does it at low efficiency , we have to choose one way to intervene this problem first .
And given that treatment is much more expensive than prevention .
The paradise recommended that the greatest achievement would be to invest in prevention .
So the amount that we &apos;re going to spend , on treatment , we can work much more than the variable , but it will benefit 10 times this variable if we spend on prevention .
So again , focusing on prevention instead of treatment , is the beginning .
That &apos;s what I showed us to think about our own responsibilities .
I want each of you to look at the list of your priorities and say , is what you wrote right ?
Or is it a little bit closer than I &apos;m showing you here ?
Climate change is , of course , one of the most important things .
I find a lot of you who find that , it &apos;s wrong to walk in that order .
And they say we have to deal with climate change , if not for another reason , at least because it &apos;s a very big problem .
But of course we can &apos;t deal with all the problems .
Our world is full of problems .
And what I want to emphasize is , if we focus on problems , are the problems that we really need to focus on .
We can do a lot more with it than we can &apos;t do much about it .
And I really think Toma Cheng is one of the participants in the dream team , it &apos;s a very good system .
One of the things that we forget a lot is that in 100 years , when we think that the effect of global change is going to be the biggest for us , people will be more fortunate at the time .
In terms of the most common terms , the U.N.
You expect the average person in the developing world to be 2100 times more wealth than we are right now .
And very likely , about two to four times as much as we are right now .
And of course we &apos;re also going to be more wealth than we are now .
But the idea here is that when we talk about saving humanity , or helping people in Bangladesh for example in 2100 , we haven &apos;t talked about the poor in Bangladesh .
We &apos;re talking about the rich average person in the Netherlands .
So the reality here raises a question , do we really want to spend a lot of money to help a little bit , over the next hundred years to help the rich Dutch Mediterranean ?
Or do we really want to help the real poor , now , in Bangladesh , who really needs our help ? And who are we going to help , at least possible cost ?
And as Chile said , imagine yourself a rich person — as it would be — rich from China or from Bolivia or from Congo in 2100 review in 2005 , wouldn &apos;t you say , &quot; &quot; How weird their big interest is to us , they helped us a little bit about global warming , and they took care of a fairly simple , and my great-grandfather , who could help him more than that , so I emphasize that , and I really need to make it better .
Even if we &apos;re not approved to our perceptions about how important these problems are .
And of course , the reason it &apos;s fundamentally caused is that issues like global warming have good images .
We &apos;ve all seen in &quot; &quot; The Day after tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it was a great movie , right ?
It was a great film in photography that I would like to see , right , but I don &apos;t think the director Ronald Eirich uses Brad Pitt in his next film as a hero , digging health channels in Tanzania or so on — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s not the case for a good movie goal .
So in many ways , I see that Copenhagen Forum and everything that had been done on priorities was defending these boring problems .
And it &apos;s going to make us realize that solving these things is not a goal to feel comfortable .
And it &apos;s not the goal to bring a big media noise , but it &apos;s really the goal to do change in its right place , effectively .
And the other assumptions , which I think is important and should say is that , in some ways , we always choose wrong .
Right , we have to solve the sum of these problems , in a perfect world — I &apos;ll surely agree with you .
I think we should care about everything , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided to spend twice as much as we were spending , now , more than 1970,000 on the developing world .
Since then , our aid has halved .
So it seems that we &apos;re not on the right way to solve all these problems once .
On the other hand , some people will say what about the Iraq War ?
We spent about 100 billion dollars there . Why didn &apos;t we spend that money in the service of our world ?
And I &apos;m with you in that .
And if anybody can talk to George Bush about that , that &apos;s good .
But what &apos;s important here is that if we get another 100 billion dollars , we have to decide to act the best way we can , right ?
And the fundamental issue here is to go back to ourselves and think very well about the most important priorities and correction .
But I want to briefly ask , is this a list really true ?
You know , we consulted the best economists , often you would end up asking an older man from white Americans .
And they &apos;re not necessarily — you know , they don &apos;t have the best view they can look at in the world .
So we invited 80 young people from around the world to discuss and solve the same problem .
And there were activists for acceptance number one that they were teaching at university , and the second is they were speaking English at all .
Most of them were from developing countries .
Everybody got the same data , but they could look at it from other points of view , and so what they actually did , they came out with their own list .
And surprisingly , it was very similar to our own — it was malnutrition and malaria at the top and climate change at the bottom of the list .
And we &apos;ve done this many times .
They have different universities and in conferences from multiple directions .
And they were all coming out almost the same list .
And that gives me a lot of hope to say that I believe we &apos;re on the right way of thinking about our priorities , and in particular what &apos;s the most important in the world ?
And of course , I repeat that in a perfect world , we &apos;re going to solve everything .
But if we can &apos;t do this , we have to think about what we should start first ?
And I see Copenhagen &apos;s meeting is progress .
We did it in 2004 , and I hope it will attract many people , to the next conference in 2008 , which is next in 2012 .
Let &apos;s map the right way to the world , and let &apos;s also start thinking about political priorities .
And let &apos;s think of saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do it with those things that are going to cost a lot and produce a little bit , and not those things that we don &apos;t know yet what to do about them , but let &apos;s do those things that we &apos;ve made a wonderful impact on the world at low cost and at the moment . &quot; And at the end of the day , you can vary with this way we identify these priorities , but we have to be honest and honest when we say that you &apos;re going to do something else .
And if we get too concerned about some things , it &apos;s going to end up not worrying about something else .
So in closing , I hope that this will help us define our ideal priorities , and to think about how we can use the world ideally .
Thank you .
A little and weird invention is being talked about .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
What you &apos;re allowed to do is see the very small organisms that don &apos;t see with the naked eye .
Soon , a medical discovery will come along showing that many of these organisms are causing serious human diseases .
Imagine what happened to the community when I realized that the mother of English and in her tea Shah was actually drinking a soup full of germs . Not far from here . This was in London .
200 years later .
These germs are still around us and they &apos;re still controlling their grip on developing countries around the tropics .
Just for malaria , there are a million deaths every year , and more than a billion people need to diagnose because they &apos;re exposed to different kinds of malaria infections .
Now , in fact , it &apos;s very easy to recognize many of these germs .
You take a formula , for example , the orange spores , the Velcri or the beautiful , etc . , to look at it .
They all have faces .
He was still Alex from Kenya , a Muslim in Bangladesh , and a window in Mumbai and Julie and Mary in Uganda waiting months to be diagnosed to know why they were patients ?
And this is in the first place , because diagnosis is very far from the medal .
And remember that number : a billion .
The problem is in the microscope itself .
Although modern science is at the top of the face , it &apos;s the microscope of research that &apos;s not designed for field tests .
It wasn &apos;t even designed to make diagnosis at all .
It &apos;s heavy , it &apos;s huge , it &apos;s hard to take care of and it costs a lot of money .
This is Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s image in the &apos; 40s , and he uses the same way that we use today to diagnose malaria in his miracle in India .
Two of my students traveled , Jim and James , all over India and Thailand , and they started thinking about this problem a lot .
We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
We saw fungi growing on the lens of the microscope .
And we saw people who had a practical microscope , but they didn &apos;t know how to run it .
What came out of this work and this journey was the fact that we call folded microscopes .
What is the folded microscope ?
The folded microscope is a very practical microscope , a platform for radioactivity and light and polarization , and projection , all the advanced microscopes are made from a folded paper .
So now you &apos;re thinking , how is this possible ?
Now I &apos;m going to show you a couple of examples here , and we &apos;re going to come up very quickly .
It starts with one piece of paper .
What you see here is all the components that are possible to build the microscope of the light and the radioactivity microscope .
So , there are three stages : there &apos;s the visual stage , the lighting phase , the mask phase .
And there are little versions down there that form a piece of paper itself .
What you do is you take it , and just like you play with a game , and it &apos;s really like that , I press it , and I separate it .
This paper has no instructions or languages .
There &apos;s a code , a colored colored code , telling you how to cover that particular microscope .
When it &apos;s ready , it looks kind of like this , it has all the functions of the perfect microscope , like a P.C. , a place where a sample can put , for example , here .
We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that has been improved over the years , and it used to be many health workers .
So that &apos;s what changed , but ideal stakes are still the same for many different diseases .
You enter it very quickly .
There &apos;s a phase of text , and then the focus phase , which is the fold mechanism that &apos;s built in the paper itself to allow us to move and concentrate the lenses by the microns .
And what &apos;s really interesting about this , which is what my students hate to do , but I &apos;m going to do it anyway , these are expensive devices .
I can turn it on and throw it on the ground and really try to put my foot on it .
And they last a long time , even though they were designed from flexible materials , like paper .
And another interesting fact , here &apos;s what we &apos;re actually sending out there as a classic diagnostic tool , but here in this room I have 30 different types of storm-based microscopes of different structures , all in one file .
And I &apos;m going to pick one at random .
This , it turns out , was designed specifically for malaria , because it had radioactive filters designed specifically to diagnose malaria .
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes emerged through this .
So far , you haven &apos;t really seen what I &apos;m going to see through one of these devices .
So what I &apos;d like to do is , can we make the lights light light light light , please . It also turns out that the folded microscope is also the risk of projecting .
I have these two little microscopes that I &apos;m going to play — and I &apos;m going to go behind the wall — and I &apos;m just showing you , and in this way you &apos;ll see exactly what I &apos;m going to see .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) This is a cross-section of the eye , and when you zoom in , there is , something through the axis .
You actually see how the lens cut together in a mathematical pattern .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I like to hate this one , it &apos;s the mosquito , and you see the electronic mosquito .
There .
All of this is through the simple numbers I described .
My wife recently tested Midani for some of our advisers by washing my clothes when I forget it in the Enlightenment machine .
So it turns out it &apos;s anti-water , and — ( Laughter ) here I have radioactive water , and I don &apos;t really know if you can see this .
And this also shows you how the scale of the projection works .
You can see the light and the way it &apos;s shown and bends .
Can you re-light please ?
I &apos;m going to show you very quickly , especially I don &apos;t have time , in terms of manufacturing costs , the big idea was to be made in a finite balls , so we designed it for 50 cents to include pieces and costs .
( Applause ) And what we can do is think of a new paradigm in the microscope that we call the microscope &quot; Use it and draw it . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you a quick glimpse of some of the pieces that you use .
This is a piece of paper .
This was when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A4 paper .
These three stages that you see .
And the visual ingredients , if you look at the integration on the top right , we had to find a way to manufacture the lenses in the paper itself with high productivity , so it uses self-assembly and the compressed surface to build the cosmic lenses in the paper itself .
Here &apos;s where the lens are .
There are sources of light .
And basically , ultimately , all the parts are browsing in the form of origami , because origami can get accuracy at the level of the microRNA .
Although it looks like a simple game , the engineering aspects of it are something rather sophisticated .
There &apos;s another obvious thing that we might do , usually , if I want to show that these little microscopes are strong , I &apos;ll go to the third and throw them out of there .
It &apos;s there , and it &apos;s survived .
So for us , the next step is to end our field experience .
We &apos;re going to start at the end of the summer .
We &apos;re at a stage through which we &apos;re going to make thousands of microscopes .
It &apos;s going to be the first time we &apos;re going to do field experiments at the highest density of microscopes ever in a particular place .
We started collecting data on malaria , the performance of the American tribes and the neighbors of the patients themselves .
And I want to leave you with this picture .
I &apos;ve never planned this before , but there &apos;s a really interesting connection between actual participation in science and global health education .
What tools are we providing for children who are going to fight those germs tomorrow ?
I love being able to print the folded microscope and carry them in their pockets .
Thank you .

Our world is full of superheroes .
But these live under a painful reality : the reality of marginalization .
The emergence of a college class of waste reflected on social inequality and unemployment , the rigid waste bill and the functional performance of a waste collection system .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of the recycled waste .
Most of the garbage collectors work independently collecting waste from the streets , and then selling it in the cheap , cheap yards .
They collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and Brazilian vehicles .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an art activist is a social art , environmental and political printer .
In 2007 , I launched my work beyond the vertebrates to the Brazilian vehicle Carroolas as as a cultural support for my painting .
At that time , the idea was delivered to the garbage collectors .
They are now in a place : roads , public media , social media .
So , I drowned in this world and I didn &apos;t stop working .
I &apos;ve drawn over 200 Carroolas trucks in many cities and invited to create exhibitions and travel around the world .
And then I learned that the waste college in the margin issue , not a ruler in Brazil .
I got together with the garbage collectors in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey , and also in developed countries like America and Japan .
So I realized that I needed a large number of individuals to join that issue because it was a huge challenge .
After that , I created a collaborative movement called &quot; &quot; My Fantastic Honey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) — massively funded .
Thank you .
( Applause )
My wonderful &quot; &quot; awesome &quot; &quot; is a huge crowdsourcing movement to help the garbage collectors with their vehicles .
In addition to helping them professionally and healthier , like providing services from doctors , dentists , children , hairstyles , domestic professionals and more .
In addition , waste universities also take our shells and protective gloves and sunglasses and realistic empathy from the rain so that we see the city , whereas their cars are being designed by our wonderful volunteers .
The waste collectors also received elements of safety as reflective strips of light , markets and mirrors .
My own garbage prize project moved to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and Kuritiba .
In order to become a requirement for other cities outside Brazil , we &apos;ve created the PCx Project inspired by TEDx , a simple project , doing its own , and it &apos;s another picture of my own garbage prize .
Now everybody can join .
In two years , more than 170,000 of my garbage and 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 10,000 manners joined the Zino of my trash garbage movement that used to pour their work in teaching the recycling of local schools .
So the waste collectors now leave the margins behind them to become more respectable and more valuable .
Because , with their chronic displays , they are able to fight in the face of the crowd by increasing their physical income and interacting them in the community .
Now I challenge you to reconsider the recognition of waste universities and other hidden heroes in your city .
To believe this or not , in the world , over 20 million waste universities .
Thank you very much .
About a year and a half ago , Steven Luller who also happened here at TED in 2007 about virtual Earth encouraged me to become an engineer in Bing Maps , which is a effort from Microsoft to mapping the Internet .
In the last two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working really hard to redefine the way maps work on the Internet .
And we actually see that through very different conditions of this kind of map and trends that people used to .
So , the first thing you might notice about the mapping site , it &apos;s very easy to zoom in and rotate , which , if you &apos;re aware of Bryan , it comes from there .
Mapping is , of course , not just mapping , it &apos;s also photography .
So , as we zoom in on a particular level , it takes us to kind of like a Citi in a 45-degree virtual display .
And you can see it from any fundamental trends to show you the three-dimensional structure of the city , all the interfaces .
Now , we see this region , and this three-dimensional environment that looks like a painting that has all sorts of applications on it , and the map trends are actually just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones we &apos;ve shown , just in the last two months , since we &apos;ve launched .
So , for example , two days after the disaster happened in Haiti , we had a map of the earthquake that showed premature images and after the earthquake taken from the sky .
This great app that I don &apos;t have time to show you takes local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those input into places that are referred to in blogs .
It &apos;s fantastic .
But I &apos;m going to show you some of the most fun things .
So , we see photography , of course , doesn &apos;t stop in the sky .
These green bubbles represent the instructions photennsylvinger put in .
I &apos;m not going to go into defining it too , but photphorus is going to marvel at the map .
All that &apos;s covered in blue is one of the areas that we &apos;ve taken pictures of on the ground as well .
And so , when you land . ( Applause ) Thank you . When you land down , and you see this kind of panoramic imaging , the first thing you might notice is that not just a picture , there &apos;s a three-dimensional estimate in this environment that &apos;s equivalent to the three-dimensional appreciation of the city above , so if you click on something to get a closer demo than that , then the fact that this transition looks like in fact , is the function of all of those three dimensions behind this three-dimensional model .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a really interesting application that we &apos;re working on collaborating with our friends in Flickr .
This app takes a geometric scan of Flickr and uses processes like Potosphorus II to connect that to our photography , so — I &apos;m not sure if this is what I mean to show , but — ( Laughter ) — but notice — and this is , of course , a famous tourist site , and there &apos;s a lot of images around us , and I &apos;ve taken all these pictures at different times .
This is a picture taken at about five o &apos;clock .
This is Flickr Flickr , and this is our picture .
So you really see how these kinds of images that people have taken in a very profound way , on the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why it &apos;s interesting one of them , of course , is the time it takes to travel .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the great historical imagery here , but there are some images of horses and vehicles as well .
But what &apos;s great about this app is that , not only does it work to amplify this visual representation of the world with things that come from users , but it &apos;s also the basis for amplifying reality , which I &apos;ll show you more in a moment .
I &apos;ve now moved inside . And this is also interesting .
Well , notice there &apos;s a roof above us .
We &apos;re in the Pike Place market .
And this is something that we can do with a mobile camera , so , we don &apos;t just picture on the street with this camera on the rooftops of cars , but we &apos;re also photographing inside .
And from here , we can do the same kind of recording , not just from static images , but also from video .
And this is something that we &apos;re going to try now for the first time , in a living transmission that &apos;s really , really , really scary .
( Laughter ) Okay .
( Ringing ) Okay , guys , are you there ?
( Cheers ) Okay , I &apos;m going to squeeze now , I &apos;m going to press the switch button .
I &apos;m in live transmission . Okay . Here we are .
So , these are our friends at Pike Place , the lab .
( Applause ) And they &apos;re directly broadcast to us .
Well , George , can you turn back to the corner of the market ?
Because I want to show the interesting points .
No , no . The other side .
Yeah , yeah . Come back to the corner . Come back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
Okay . Okay . Get back . Get back . Go back .
Okay . Don &apos;t worry .
What I wanted to show you were these interesting points from here on the top of the picture because the feeling that it gives you is the way , if you &apos;re really in the place — you can think about this — is taking a step in addition to amplifying reality .
What , guys — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re working on two different things — well , I &apos;m going to close the line now .
We &apos;re working on two different things here .
One is to take this ...
( Laughter ) Okay , let me pause a moment to thank the team .
They did a fantastic job .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and go out .
And as I walk outside , I &apos;m going to point out here , we &apos;re using the property of being on the dimension of the Typtych , but you can use it immediately , in the inflation of reality .
When you use it immediately , that means you &apos;re able to show all that definition and that information around the world for you .
And here , we &apos;re taking the extra step in the broadcast as well .
That we see , by the way , on the 4G network of the market .
Well , there &apos;s another TED Talk that Microsoft gave in the last few years .
And he gave the lecture Kertz Wong , Word and Telescope .
And now we go to where it &apos;s traditionally , after a long day in the market , going out into a space , but also staring in the sky .
And this is the combine of the Lord and the Telescope in our map .
( Applause ) This is — thank you — this is the present time , but if we move time , then we can see the sky differently than time , and we can get all this information about different times and different history . Let &apos;s move the moon a little bit higher in the sky , maybe change history .
I &apos;d like to zoom in on the Moon a little bit .
This is a complete photosynthesis of the sky integrated with the Earth .
Well now , my time is over , so I have to stop .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about two things today that we &apos;ve lost and the other is the way we &apos;re going to return it .
And let me start with this ?
This is the baseline of this is the Mediterranean coast of fish , and it &apos;s a naked picture and a lot of sea urchins that feed on algae .
Something like this is the first thing I saw when I jumped in the water for the first time on the Spanish coast of the Mediterranean Sea .
Now if an alien hoop on the ground — and let &apos;s call it Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe dives into a coral area , space will see a lot of things .
It &apos;s not likely to sink into a coral reef with virgin coral reefs , full of coral reefs , sharks , crocodiles , sea sheep , hammergers , water turtles , etc .
So most of what Joe will see will be in this part , in the green part of the picture .
Here &apos;s the worst situation , where dead reefs and lots of microbes and water jellyfish .
And where the diver here is the same as most coral reefs in the world right now , very few corals , and algae grow faster than corals , lots of bacteria , and all the big animals have disappeared .
And that &apos;s what most marine scientists saw as well .
This is the baseline for them . This is what they think is normal because we &apos;ve started modern science to dive a long time since we started to contaminate marine ecosystems .
So I &apos;m going to put all of us in a time machine and we &apos;re going to go to the left , we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see how the ocean was at this time .
And we &apos;re going to start with this time machine , the Antarctica or the tropics where we did a series of National Geographic expeditions .
This sea is the archipelago of the Kiribati Republic that stretches through the equator line , and has many uninhabited islands , the sugar and a few of them are populated .
So let &apos;s start with this — the island of Christmas — over 5,000 people .
Most people are dead . Most corals are dead , algae feeds on them , and most fish are smaller than the pencil we use in their enemy .
We covered 250 hours there in 2005 .
And we didn &apos;t see one shark .
This is where the Cook Cook captain discovered in 1777 , and he described that he saw a large group of sharks bouncing bubbles and rabbiting their little boats going down to the beach .
Let &apos;s put time a little bit further in the past .
&quot; &quot; Fang Island , &quot; &quot; 2,500 people .
Here &apos;s the reef better . A lot of little fish .
And that &apos;s what a lot of submersibles might think of as heaven .
This is what you see in most marine National Park in Florida Kiz Islands .
And many people think that &apos;s really cool , if that &apos;s the baseline for you .
If you go back to a place like Pora Otl , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , people were better and there were sharks .
You can see sharks in every diver .
And this is a very unusual thing compared to the corals that we normally see .
But if we move the punishment to 200 or 500 years in the past , we &apos;ll get to places where the corals are in their entire health and meet them , forming beetles and predators are the most influenza where you see between 25 to 50 sharks per diver .
What have we learned from those places ?
That &apos;s what we thought was normal .
This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
If we put all the fish in the coral reefs and distributed them this is what we expect to see .
Most of the biomass is made of organisms below the food chain , the grass , like the monsters that eat algae .
And then the nutrients on plankton , which are small fish , feeding on little floating animals in the water .
And then we have a smaller biomass of meat , a smaller mass of it from the top of the chain , sharks , big sharks , big sharks , big sharks .
But this is the punishment .
This vision of the world is the result of studying coral reefs after contaminating them and analyzing them .
When we went to a peak people , we realized that the natural world had flipped upside down . The pyramid had become accepted .
Most of the biomass has come from the top of the food chain , in most places where their proportion has reached 85 percent as Keningman coral , which is now protected .
The good news is that , in addition to more predatory fish , there &apos;s more .
The size of those boxes is bigger .
We have more sharks , more mass of the fins , and more mass of grass fish as well , like the gasoline fish , which is a sea goat .
Where the reefs clean up , all they grow to become visible , the fish eat maintained on the reef clean and give the opportunity for the coral to regenerate .
They don &apos;t have the elite places , they just have a lot of fish , but they &apos;re also full of other important components of the ecosystem , like the giant Polynaus , describing vast amounts of giant lakes , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
That &apos;s disappeared from every area that &apos;s populated by populations in the world , which is Pullus filming water , making it invisible to microbes and germs .
But now there &apos;s been global warming .
If the fisheries are in those areas because they &apos;re protected by law or because of their remote location , that would be great .
But the water is getting hot for a long time and the people are dying .
So how do these fish and these predators help ?
Well , what we saw is that in that particular area , in one of the years the E-Nino proliferation between &apos; 97 and &apos; 98 was warm for a very long time , and a lot of coral reefs have proved and a lot of them have died .
In Christmas , where the food network has declined so much and all the big animals have disappeared that corals can &apos;t recover .
In Fang Island , corals didn &apos;t recover .
But you can see here a large surface of the coral is dead , and it &apos;s floating .
And the fish have planted algae until they become less algae layer .
And then we go to the Myra Atlanta , which contains more mass than grass , and those corals are clean and those corals come back .
And when you go to the Norwegian side , have you ever turned this up ?
These places are also white , but they recover very quickly .
Whenever the food network is intact and inclusive and complex , the resilience of the system , the more likely it is to recover from the extreme effects of thermal change .
That &apos;s good news . So we want to restore this organization .
We want to make sure that all the components of the ecosystem exist so that the system can adapt to global warming results .
So if we had to reset the baseline , if we wanted to reset the ecosystem on the left , what could we do ?
Well , there are many ways .
One of those ways is very clear , and these are marine protected , especially No-Tech protected , which we value to allow the marine life to recover .
And let &apos;s go back to that picture of the Mediterranean Sea .
This was my measure . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
And at the same time I was watching Jack Cousteau TV rings , looking at diversity and richness and abundance .
And I thought this richness only belongs to the tropics , and that the Mediterranean Sea is an ancestor .
But , I had a few knowledge until I first jumped into a marine reserve .
And that &apos;s what I saw , a lot of fish .
Some years , from five to seven years , the fish come back and eat the grasses and then the algae grows again .
So you have a small area of algae in the size of a laptop , and you can find over 100 species of algae , most of which are measured by microscopic foot , full of small fish and plankton that will represent food for fish , and the system will restore its health again .
And in this particular place , the Meditors Island protected , which is 94 hitters and adds six million Euros to the local economy , 20 times as much as fishing enters , which is 88 percent of the tourist income .
So these protected areas , not only do the ecosystem help but also those who can benefit from ecosystems .
So let me summarize for you what fisheries do .
That &apos;s where we protect them . When we compare those habitats to the unprotected areas , that &apos;s what happens .
The number of species increases by 21 percent . So if you have 1,000 species we expect there are 200 more species in the marine protected .
And this is a very fundamental thing .
The size of the species is a third bigger . So the fish are this big .
A lot , the number of fish in every square meter , over 170 percent .
And biomass — this is the most glamorous changes — 4.5 times the average biomass , just after five to seven years .
And in some places it &apos;s reached 10 times the biomass inside the reserve .
So we have all these factors that are growing inside the reserve , so what do we do ?
Fish breed . This is a thousand ecology epidemic .
If the fish don &apos;t kill , they live longer , they increase in size , and they breed a lot .
And the same for vertebrates . This is an example .
These are white bags placed by snails outside Chile coast , and this is how much eggs I put on the bottom .
Out of the reserve , you can &apos;t even see it or recognize it .
1.3 million eggs per square meter in the marine protected area where the number of snail is so many .
So these organisms reproduce . The larvae form , and then the little ones come out and spread and get people to benefit from them .
This is in the Bahamas , the Saharas .
A huge number of sharks inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you get .
And the fisherman harvest is increasing .
You can see where the protected area is from the broken boats then .
So there &apos;s a fish proliferation , so if they achieve gains even outside the protected boundaries that help people around them and at the same time maintain the protected environment as a whole , it gives resilience .
So what we have now , which is the world without reserves , like a bank account that we pull out all the time without deception at all .
Development , it &apos;s a savings account .
We have the principle of non-touch that gives social return , economically and environmentally .
And if you think about the increase in biomass inside the reserves , it &apos;s the same as the benefits combined , right ?
Two other examples of how those reserves can work .
This is how much hunters get every day in Kenya from hunting , over a number of years in an area without protection ; open to everyone .
And once you remove one of the most anti-fishing tools of fish , which is the Swiss , the fishermen increase .
And the less you catch , the more fish you catch .
But if we add on top of all this , &quot; &quot; no fisheries , &quot; &quot; the fishermen will continue to increase where they &apos;re hunting at a lower rate around the protected area .
Another example : the Samaraso fish in Billize in Central America people .
This is the mating season of the Hammer sharks where the moon is collected at the time of the moon in December and January for a week .
They were typically collecting in numbers up to 30,000 fish , in this size in one hectare in one group .
And fishermen know this , they hunt them , they exploit them .
When I first went there in 2000 , there were 3,000 Hammer fish left .
And fishermen have been shocked by only 30 percent of all walkable groups every year .
So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t need a rocket scientist to know this , if you take 30 percent every year your career is going to go very fast .
And with the profession , the genitalia of diversity is about as much and extinct .
And this has already happened in places around the Caribbean Sea .
They only get 4,000 dollars a year out of all fishing and all fishing boats .
Now , if you do an economic analysis and imagine what happens , if you put fish fisheries and you just bring 20 submarines a month in the year , income will double by more than 20 times , and it &apos;s something that can be installed over time .
So how many of these reserves do we have ?
If it &apos;s that good , and if it &apos;s so easy , how protected do we have ?
You &apos;ve heard this before under one percent of the ocean lies under protection .
And we &apos;re approaching the one percent now thanks to Aristotle Chaos , and a small percentage of this is completely protected from fishing .
Scientific studies report protecting at least 20 percent of the ocean .
The capacity is between 20 to 50 percent in order to achieve a series of goals for biodiversity and resilience and fisheries .
Now is this possible ? People might ask : What is the cost of a project like this ?
Well , let &apos;s think about what we &apos;re paying now to support fish fisheries . 35 billion dollars a year .
And a lot of those aid goes into destructive fishing methods .
Well , there are a number of estimates to compute what it can cost to make a network of protected areas to cover 20 percent of the ocean , which is a tiny percentage compared to what we &apos;re paying now , and the government gives it to the fisheries industry .
The hunters lose their work because of hunting .
Making a network of reserves will provide direct jobs for more than a million people , plus high school jobs and side earnings .
So how do we do this ?
If it &apos;s obvious that these savings accounts are useful for the environment and people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean protected ?
And how do we get there ?
Well , there are two ways to get there .
The simple solution is to create very large protected areas like Archimedes .
The problem is that keeping these large areas requires uninhabited places , where there are no social conflicts , where the political cost is low , and also the economic cost .
And a few of us , a few organizations in this room or anywhere they work on this .
But what about the rest of the world &apos;s coast , where people live and compress fish ?
Well , there are three main reasons why there aren &apos;t tens of thousands of small protected so far . The first reason is that nobody has any idea what marine protected areas are doing , and usually fishermen are very defensive when the subject is regulating or shutting up a space of water no matter how small it is .
Two : their management systems are not true where most coastal societies around the world don &apos;t have the power to monitor resources in order to keep the reserve and reinforce it .
It &apos;s a heartbreaking hierarchy where people are waiting to be representative of the government , and that &apos;s untouched , and the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
And that takes us to the third reason why there are no more protected areas is that the funding methods were wrong .
Governments and NGOs put a lot of time and energy and resources in very small areas .
So protecting coastal and conservation of marine life have become a solution for government or charity , and that &apos;s not constant .
So solutions come from fixing those three reasons .
First of all , we need to develop global communal campaigns to inspire local communities and governments to make better pockets than existing ones .
It &apos;s the savings accounts in the face of cloud calculations without deception .
Secondly , we need to redesign the administration system so that the sovereign effort is distributed — not concentrated so that parents don &apos;t rely on the work of NGOs or the work of government bodies and to be created by local communities like in the Philippines and elsewhere .
And third , and most importantly , we need to develop new business models .
According to the philanthropy pool , just to make protected areas is something that can &apos;t be reliable on its fruits .
We really need to develop new business models where coastal protection is investment , because as we know these marine protected give social , environmental and economic benefits .
And I want to end with one idea , which is that there is no organization in itself that can save the ocean .
There was a lot of competition in the past . We need to develop a new model of partnership , real cooperation , where we seek integration and not replacement .
There &apos;s a lot at stake to continue as we are .
So let &apos;s do this . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you , Eric .
EH : Thank you .
CA : I &apos;ve been able to connect things together .
First , your manual pyramid that shows 85 percent of the biomass represented by predators , this seems impossible .
How does 85 percent live on only 15 percent of the fish ?
EH : All right , imagine you have two trillion hours , one big and the other one is small .
The big one moves very slowly and the small moves very quickly .
That &apos;s the principle .
The animals at the bottom of the food chain , they reproduce very quickly and they grow very quickly .
Over and over , we have sharks and big fish that live 25 , 30 years .
And they breed very slowly , and their metabolic metabolism is slow , and essentially their bioluminescence remains as it is .
So the surplus production of these small animals is below enough to maintain that biomass that doesn &apos;t move .
It works like the density of the system .
CA : That &apos;s a remarkable thing .
If we think of the food pyramid we have to completely change it .
EH : At least in the sea , yes .
What we discovered in coral reefs is that the pyramid is the equivalent of the Sardinian system , but there are five black animals in the wild .
And on land it doesn &apos;t work .
But at least it &apos;s true with coral systems where infrastructure in the pyramid has this structure .
We think it &apos;s a global norm .
But we started to study the early people very recently .
CA : So the numbers I &apos;ve presented are really amazing .
You say we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on aid .
While we only need 16 billion to make 20 percent of the ocean protected marine areas that will give new choices to the hunters .
If the world is smarter to solve that problem , they &apos;re 19 billion dollars .
We &apos;ll have 19 billion dollars to spend on health care or something .
EH : And then we have the results of the fishing profession , so we have 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the key solutions is to make the World Trade Organization transfer those aid into sustainable practices .
CA : I &apos;ve heard a lot of examples outside of how aid crazy this is done .
So thank you for those numbers .
The last question is a personal question .
A lot of the people sitting here who have been in the ocean for a long time have been seeing these corridors , the goats that they once saw were beautiful getting worse , something frustrating .
Tell me about the feeling that I had to test when I went to those areas and saw the return to the better .
EH : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We go there trying to understand ecosystems , trying and measure fish and sharks to see how different these places are from the ones we know .
But the best I felt was this vital fever that Edward Wilson talks about , where humans have a sense of wonder and glamour , and unpleasant nature .
And there , just there you feel that you &apos;re just part of something that &apos;s bigger than a large global ecosystem .
And for those places that give me hope , I wouldn &apos;t continue to follow this work .
It would become something very frustrating .
CA : Well , Eric , thank you for sharing us in part of that spiritual experience . Thank you .
EH : Thank you very much .
In 1995 , I was still in college , and my friend and I decided to go on a journey across the country by the car from Rodi Island County or Portland in Oregon .
We were hungry , we were running out of work , and we decided to start doing this through the sub-ways through national parks and local forests , the plan was to take you as long as possible .
And in the middle of the road in Dakota , I looked at my girlfriend and I asked her about something that was urging me all the 2,000 miles that we expressed .
I asked , &quot; What &apos;s the story of this Chinese letter that I see all the way ? &quot;
I looked at my girlfriend , very peculiar .
There &apos;s a guy sitting in front of me now looking at me the same view .
( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; This is all these paintings that show every flavor , and it &apos;s got the Chinese letter . &quot; &quot; She looked at me for a moment , and then she ran out of laughter because she figured out what I was wondering .
I was wondering about this sign .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the famous Chinese letter that expresses the zones of the park . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the past five years of my life thinking about these kinds of situations that look exactly like when we understand them wrong , all of these signals , and how we act when we find out we &apos;re wrong about it , and all of this tells us about our nature as human beings .
In other words , as you heard from Chris , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about when you get wrong .
Maybe that &apos;s a little bit shocking . I mean , that specialization , but actually it &apos;s a special specialty , because nobody &apos;s competing with it .
( Laughter ) In fact , all of us , do everything , try the impossible to avoid acknowledging his mistakes , or at least thinking that it might be wrong .
We get into it . We forget it , we might get it wrong .
In fact , everybody in this room makes mistakes .
In fact , humans are mapped to error .
But when it comes to me today , all of the beliefs that I believe in , now in this case , abstraction in self-evaluation , and in being vulnerable , I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;m wrong with .
And the problem with this is that we &apos;re in a situation where we live .
We bring in meetings in the case of &quot; &quot; now , &quot; &quot; the current moment , &quot; &quot; we go out to family trips in the case of &quot; &quot; now , the present moment , &quot; &quot; we vote , and we express our opinions in the state of &quot; &quot; right now .
It &apos;s a very efficient way to move forward in this life and to hold ourselves in this bubble that surrounds us , which is how we feel that we &apos;re right at everything .
I think that &apos;s a big problem .
It &apos;s a big problem for us , both individually , personally , practical and social , and I think that &apos;s a problem that is cumulative to our culture .
What I want to do today is first talk to you about closing into a bubble , our inner sense of being right .
And second , it wasn &apos;t so bad .
And then I &apos;m going to convince you that it &apos;s possible to get out of this bubble , and if you do that , it &apos;s going to be the greatest moral and creative act that you can do in life .
So , why are we stuck in that bubble , our permanent bubble is that we are right ?
One of the most important reasons is the feeling of being wrong .
Let me ask people a question . No , let me ask people , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how close you feel when you &apos;re wrong .
Good , depressed .
Perfect . Okay . Perfect .
&quot; &quot; Well , embarrassing . &quot; &quot; Thank you . That &apos;s the right answer , but that &apos;s the answer to another question .
You answer the question , what do you feel when you realize you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) If you realize that you &apos;re wrong , it makes you feel all that , right ?
I mean , it could be devastating , but it could be inspiring , and it could be funny like my place when I realized my mistake about the Chinese letter .
But being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like this .
Let me explain to you , how is the truth about being wrong ?
Do you remember the cartoon &quot; &quot; Lonny Town , &quot; &quot; when he shows &quot; &quot; The Lord of the Cats , &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s following the lunchline and he &apos;s not holding it at all ?
In every episode that happens , there &apos;s a moment when the fly is flying , the bird is flying off the shelf , and that &apos;s normal , because the bird can fly .
But the problem is that the fly is going back through the shelf .
And that &apos;s funny , if you &apos;re six years old and you &apos;re depressed , there &apos;s no problem with that .
And he keeps going back to the moment he &apos;s looking down his feet and realizing he &apos;s in the air .
And then it falls into a handsome .
When we &apos;re wrong , we don &apos;t realize it , I mean before we realize it , so we &apos;re like this wolf during the length of it , until we look down .
So we &apos;re really wrong , and we &apos;re in trouble , but unfortunately we feel like we &apos;re standing on hard land .
So , I have to recommend what I said before .
What we feel when we &apos;re wrong is we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s one reason . That &apos;s a fundamental reason . Well , why do we get stuck in our sense that we &apos;re right ?
I call this blindness .
We often don &apos;t have any internal evidence that we &apos;re completely wrong about something until time is too late to fix it .
But there &apos;s also another reason why we get stuck in this sense that we &apos;re right , and the reason is because of culture .
Let me take you back to primary school .
Remember , when you sit in the classroom , and when the teacher rewrites the test papers , one of the students looks like this .
By the way , this is not my card .
( Laughter ) Well , you &apos;re in school , and I know exactly what &apos;s going on in your room now about the student with this paper .
It &apos;s a stupid kid , a problem maker , who never does homework .
At the age of nine , we &apos;re learning and we &apos;re finding that people who make mistakes are lazy and responsible , and even more importantly , we &apos;re finding the idea that the path to success in life should be meaningful .
And we &apos;re learning these wrong lessons in a very convincing way .
And many of us , especially those in this room , deal with success in life as a parallel notion of students who are completely overlap , are much more accomplished .
Isn &apos;t that true ? Mr. the financial director , the astronomical physicist , the perfect marathon runner ?
( Laughter ) Yeah , you &apos;re all like this , managers , scientists and mathematicians .
Well , that &apos;s great .
But the problem is , we &apos;re part of the idea that we might be wrong .
Because , according to what &apos;s wrong , it means that there &apos;s something wrong with us as individuals .
So we always insist that we are always right , because this insight makes us feel that we are smart , responsible , secure .
Let me tell you a story .
Two years ago , a woman entered the Bth Israel operations center .
Both Israel is located in Boston .
It &apos;s a training center at Harvard , one of the best hospitals in the United States .
And this woman entered the operating room .
And she was chosen , and then she had a procedure , and she went back to her room for the sake .
And it all seemed pretty good .
And when I woke up , I looked at herself and I wondered , why is the other end of my body frozen ? Why is the other side of my body numb ? In fact , the surgeon had done a very large surgical procedure on the left side of the body rather than the right side of the body .
And when the Minister of Health and Medical Effairs talked about what happened in Both Israel , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; For some reason , the surgeon felt he was doing it on the other end of his surgery . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is the center of my talk — the reliability of being right on something that might be very dangerous .
The internal feeling of being traumatic is not always a reliable reference to what &apos;s happening in the outside world .
And when we act like this , the inner drive is not going to be as bad as we go wrong with the signal , it &apos;s going to end up spending 200 million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or to address the world with an economic crisis .
That &apos;s really dangerous .
It &apos;s a big internal problem , a social problem .
Imagine for a moment what it feels like when you &apos;re right about something .
That means that all of your beliefs are very ideal and reflect reality .
And when you feel that way and you have a problem or you make a decision , how do you explain your meaning to the people around you who see you &apos;re completely wrong ?
Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , it turns out that we all justify that in the same way by doing a lot of subjective assumptions .
The first is that when someone shows something we do , we assume first , they &apos;re ignorant .
They don &apos;t have the same information that we have about it , and if we display all the information that we have as generous , we don &apos;t have to understand our choices and turn them into our pages .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , we see that these people have the information that we have , and they &apos;re still opposed to what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re moving to the second assumption , which is that they &apos;re not stupid .
( Laughter ) Because they give all the stories , and they can &apos;t assemble them together to understand what we understand .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , when we see that the people who make our decisions have all the facts , and they &apos;re more conscious than we are moving to the third assumption , we assume they know the truth , but they use their profile for the reasons of evil and personal interest .
This is completely devastating .
It &apos;s about the right of our choices that prevent us from acknowledging our mistakes at times more urgent , and it motivates us to treat each other in a bad way .
But for me , the worst of all , the most painful of all , is that we lose the basic meaning of being human .
It &apos;s as if we want to imagine that our brains are not transparent windows , and we can go out and half the world as well as this .
And we want each other to do this both and to see things from the same angle that we see from it .
That &apos;s a big mistake , and if life really is , you see from one window , it &apos;s very boring .
The bone of the brain is that it doesn &apos;t see the world as it is .
He sees it on another image .
We can remember the past and think about the future , and we can imagine ourselves in other people &apos;s sites .
And we do all this simply , and that &apos;s what makes us all look at the same sky , and some of us see stars and the moon and the other darkness .
That &apos;s what makes us see things wrong .
1200 years ago , Dicquart said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking if I am here . &quot; &quot; And then Saint Augustine came and wrote , &quot; I &apos;m wrong if I exist , &quot; I &apos;m wrong if I exist . &quot;
The Gustine understood that our ability to make a mistake is not something embarrassing in the human self , something that makes us go beyond mistakes when we discover them and rebuild ourselves .
It &apos;s essential to our human existence .
Because as humans , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on .
And as humans , we &apos;re special about the rest of the species , we &apos;re obsessed with figuring out everything .
For me , this obsession is the foundation of all production and creativity .
Last year , for a number of reasons , I sat down to listen to a lot of people &apos;s radio rings — this is America &apos;s life .
And as I listened to all those rings , I suddenly started to feel like those rings were wrong .
And it occurred to me immediately that I had lost my mind .
I became the recipe for errors .
I &apos;ve been seeing errors everywhere , which is what happened next .
But two months after that , I had an opportunity to have a conversation with the ER Glass host .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You feel it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re right .
In fact , our staff and what they have in common is that all the rings have the same trend .
And the general aspect is , &quot; &quot; I thought it was going on in some way , and it goes in a completely different direction . &quot; &quot; And then Embrace said , &quot; &quot; We need these moments .
What we find is that we &apos;re wrong with it is that we need this trauma and surprise and a sense of error to make our lives going right , and for us , as viewers or listeners , or readers , we worry about these stories with a lot of them .
We love the stories of sudden ends , we are stories that completely change plans .
And believe me when it comes to us , we would love to be wrong .
Our stories are ignorant , because our lives are .
We always expect something to happen , and something else happens .
George Bush predicted that if he occupied Iraq , he would discover the weapons of mass destruction and liberate people and deploy democracy in the Middle East .
But what happened was something completely different .
And Mubarak predicted that he was going to stay the head of Egypt until his last age to become completely ill , and I think he could move power to his son .
But what happened was something completely different .
And you probably think you &apos;re going to grow up , and you &apos;re going to marry your high school lover , and then go back to your hometown and play kids together .
But what happened was something completely different .
And I have to tell you , I thought I would write a bad book , and everybody would hate it , and people wouldn &apos;t understand it .
But something the exact opposite happened .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
It carries happiness and reflection , and we tell stories about the world around us , and then the world is bouncing on us and surprised us .
I don &apos;t mean anything , but this conference , this horrible assembly is simply to make a mistake .
We spend a week talking about inventions and advances and discoveries , but you know , we didn &apos;t need all of those achievements and discoveries .
Because half of the things I showed at TED in 1998 , which was very glamorous and really cool , huh !
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t work at all . ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my jet bag , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Here we are again .
We bring the ball back .
And we come up with new ideas .
We tell new stories .
And we have a new conference .
And the title of this conference , as you heard this week , is rediscovering creativity .
And for me , if you want to rediscover creativity , you have to come out of your circle and your bubble that you &apos;re always right , trying to listen to others and look at the greatness and complexity of the universe around you and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not sure .
I might have missed this . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
On the fifth of November , 1990 , a man named Mr. Sinclair entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi Kahn , a Jewish defense leader .
We weren &apos;t basically convicted of killing , but when he was spending a prison on violent issues , he was planning with other men to attack tens of thousands of sites in New York City , including spending and Jewish temples and the headquarters of the United Nations .
Fortunately , these manuscripts were frustrated by a client by the FBI agent .
Unfortunately , in 1993 , the World Trade Center didn &apos;t land .
We were finally convicted of being attached to the process .
Mr. Inuit is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , in Pennsylvania in 1983 , a Egyptian engineer , and from a loving American mother , she was an elementary class teacher , and he went together all in their pockets to make me live a happy childhood .
By the age of seven , our family &apos;s vital started to change .
When my father showed me on the side of Islam a few people , including the majority of Muslims , they wouldn &apos;t see it .
My own experience says that when people take their time to communicate with each other , it doesn &apos;t take effort to realize that in all , we all yearn for the same things in life .
But in contrast , in every religion , in every society , you will find a few people who are so excited about their beliefs that they feel that they have to use all the necessary means to hold others to live as they do .
A few months before he arrested , he sat down and explained to me that during the weekend , some of his friends were going to the Long Island Millennium in order to exercise the goals .
And he told me I was going to meet him the next morning .
We got to the Calvon Proton field , which was , without the science of our group , observed by the FBI .
When my turn came to fire , my father helped me carry the gun on my shoulder and explain to me how I had to target the target 30 yards away .
That day , I had the last bullet that I released , the little orange light that was on top of the target and what was surprising to everybody , especially for me , that the whole goal had exploded .
My uncle turned to the rest of the men , and he said in Arabic , &quot; &quot; My father &apos;s son . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the rope from that lion .
And apparently they had burst out on this comment , but it took a few years to understand exactly what they thought was funny .
They thought they saw me the same destruction that my father was able to do .
These guys were eventually convicted of putting a small truck with 1,500 pounds of explosions on the floor under the ground to a tracking parking lot of the World Trade Center , causing a explosion that killed six people and made over 1,000 others .
These guys were my feet .
These were people called Aunmi , which means my uncle .
When I was 19 , I had moved 20 times in my life , not stabilizing that in my childhood , it didn &apos;t really give me a chance to recognize more friends .
Every time I start feeling comfortable for someone , it &apos;s that period that we have to bring our bags to move to the next city .
And because I was always the new student in the section , I was often exposed to extremism .
I was hiding my identity about my colleagues in the section to avoid my targeted , but it turns out , being the new quiet boy and the new poison in the section was a very good reminder of irony .
So often , I would spend my day at home checking books and watching TV or playing video games .
And for those reasons , I was lack of social skills , at the very least estimate , and grew up in a punished house , I couldn &apos;t get ready to face the real world .
I grew up judging people based on a standard of abuse , like a race or a religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiments that challenged my thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
During my college preparation program , I was a member of the National Guard of Youth in Philadelphia .
My own group was about the violence of young people , and being the victim of antibiotics most of my life , this was a subject that I was particularly excited about .
The members of the group were different walks of life .
One day , at the end of the council , I discovered that one of the children I had encountered was Jewish .
Now , it took me several days to show these details on the surface , and I realized there was no natural enemy between us both .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt proud that I could go over a hurdle that I had dreamed my whole life to believe that it was impossible to transcend .
A major transformation point happened when I found a summer job at Bush Gardens , a welfare park .
There , I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures , and it turns out that that experience was essential in my personal evolution .
For most of my life , I &apos;ve been told that homosexuality is a comet , and therefore , all gay people have negative impact .
And I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors on a show there , and then a little bit later I discovered that some of them were kindly , and less people judged .
Being a narcissist when I was a kid , I was a kind of empathy with other people &apos;s suffering , and it seems unnatural to me to treat people nice in any other way that I would love to work with .
Because of that feeling , I was able to compare the stereotypes that I received when I was a kid with the real life experience and dealing with people .
I don &apos;t know what it means to be gay , but I know very well what it means to be judged about something outside of my will .
And then the &quot; &quot; The Dilly Shu . &quot; &quot; So John Stewart was telling me , every night I had to be honest with myself about my torture and helped me realize that there was no relationship to one &apos;s sweat or religion or sexuality in the quality of his personality .
It was sometimes a father &apos;s personality for me when I was yesterday needed father .
Inspiration can come from an unexpected place , and being a Jewish comedian has done a lot to influence my vision of the world more than my extremist father did , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a loss to me .
One day , I was talking to my mother about how my view of the world started to change , and she told me something I would always carry in my heart as long as I lived .
I looked at two colorful eyes carrying them out of the jungle enough in his life , and she said , &quot; I was tired of people &apos;s dignity . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy it takes to carry that hatred inside you .
Zach Ibrahim is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to cut her connection to my parents and start a new life .
So why do I go out into the public and put myself in a potentially dangerous position ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I do this in the hopes that maybe one day is forced to use violence that might listen to my story and realize that there &apos;s a better way , that if you &apos;re vulnerable to that violence , and ideology is not tolerant , it &apos;s not becoming nervous .
Instead , I chose to use my experience to fight against terrorism , against prejudice .
I do this for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , the pain and the safety loss that terrorism forced them to live .
For the victims of terrorism , I &apos;m going to speak out loud against these blueprints and do what my father did .
And simply , I stand here as evidence that violence is not originally in religion or in one &apos;s ethnicity , and it &apos;s not that the son has to follow his father &apos;s fault .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , all of you . ( Applause ) Thank you , all . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
I &apos;m glad to be here .
And I thank you for inviting you and thank you .
And I really want to talk about things that interest me , but unfortunately , I doubt that what interests me is not going to interest others .
First , my card says I &apos;m an astronomer .
How much do I want to talk about astronomical research , but I doubt that the number of people who are interested in radioactivity in the Large Air Force and polarization of light in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter is the number of people who are standing in the Utopian waiting station .
I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s also interesting to talk about what was going on in 1986 and 1987 , when Hacker invented our systems at Lawrence Berkeley Lab .
And I grabbed them and realized that they were working on what the Soviet Intelligence Intelligence was and stolen the information and sell it .
I want to talk about that — and that would be fun — but , 20 years later ...
I find computer security , frankly , boring .
It &apos;s kind of mad .
I — when you do something for the first time , you do science .
The second time , it turns into engineering .
And the third time , you &apos;re just art .
I &apos;m a scientist . And when I &apos;m done , I move to something else .
I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
And I &apos;m not going to talk about saying , I think it &apos;s obvious , from my first book , &quot; &quot; The Libyan Fame , &quot; &quot; or my second book , and I &apos;m not going to talk about why I believe computers can &apos;t be in schools .
I feel that there &apos;s a tremendous , weird , scary opinion that we have to put more computers in schools .
My idea is : No ! No !
They took her out of school and kept her out .
I want to talk about this , but I see that the argument is clear for everybody who has spent so long in the early fourth grade that they don &apos;t need more talk — but , it seems like I &apos;m so wrong with that , and all I said .
So don &apos;t go back to my PhD to read it .
Let &apos;s do it full of lies as well .
And after all , I got my word five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And when you look here , the basic point I wrote on my thumb is the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , right ?
Oh , OK . And my sense is that it &apos;s strange to ask me to talk about the future , because my hair is full of young people . And so , it &apos;s absurd to talk about the future .
In fact , I see that if you really want to know what &apos;s going to happen in the future , if you really want to know the future , don &apos;t ask a rating , a scientist , a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask someone who writes Acumen .
No , if you want to know about the community 20 years later , ask an attendance teacher .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask any teacher in an attendance , ask an expert teacher .
They know what society will be like after generation .
I don &apos;t know . And so , in my opinion , other people who talk about the future , they don &apos;t know .
Of course , we can all imagine these beautiful new things that will be present in the future .
But for me , things are not the future .
The question I ask myself , how is society going to be , and our kids today are incredibly good at texting and spend an enormous amount of time in front of the screen , but they never went to play the Bullings together .
The change is happening , and this change that &apos;s happening is not the change in the software industry .
But , that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I want to talk about it , it &apos;s going to be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
Oh — the other thing I want to talk about is it &apos;s here . Here .
Is that visible ? I want to talk about things one-dimensional .
How much I want to talk about things that have only one dimension .
Because I love Mobius tapes . And I don &apos;t just like them , but I &apos;m one of the few , if I &apos;m not the only ones in the world , who make Clay bottles .
Fast forward , I hope your eyes are staring here .
This is Clay &apos;s bottle .
For those of you who know it from the audience , you might flip your eyes and say , yes . We know everything about it .
It &apos;s one branch . &quot; &quot; Inside &quot; &quot; this bottle is itself external .
Their size is zero . It &apos;s undirectable .
This imperatives have amazing properties .
If you take a Mauritius cop and you mix their two arguments together , you get one of these bottles , and I make them out of glass .
I want to talk about these bottles , but I don &apos;t have a lot to say about it because — ( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I &apos;m a titan , though , the letter &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; at TED is the first letter of Design in English .
And two weeks ago I made — you know ? I was making two bottles with small , medium sizes , and an expert .
But what I made to Tom — and I &apos;m happy to show you , for the first time in public here .
This is a two-dimensional bottle of wine , and it characterizes , even though it &apos;s in the four-dimensional world that &apos;s not supposed to carry the fluid at all , and it &apos;s capable of that because the universe we live in has only three dimensions of possibility .
And because this universe only has three dimensions of possibility , so it can carry the fluid .
So it &apos;s very — this bottle is the best .
This bottle is a month of my life .
But even though I want to talk about biology with you , I &apos;m not going to do that .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to tell you about my mother , who died last summer .
She had collected pictures of me , as all mothers do .
Can any of you raise this ?
And I looked at her album and she had put a picture of me , standing — or sitting , in 1969 , in front of a set of keys .
And I looked at her , and I said , my God , this is me when I was working at the electronic music studio !
I was an artist , doing repair work and maintenance at the computer music studio at the University of Sumani in Pavulo , and boy to the unknown !
The distant past machine . And I thought to myself , yeah !
And it brought me back .
After that , I found another picture that my mother kept , a picture of me .
This guy here is me , of course .
And the guy is Robert Moon , the inventor of Singapore , who died in August — last Apple .
Robert was a generous , good human being , a peer engineer .
And my music donates his time to teach me , a second student , first , at the University of Sanny in Pavulo .
He would come from Troomborough to teach me not only about a Moon button , but we would sit there — and I study physics at the time . 1969 , 71 .
And we study physics , I study physics , and he says , &quot; &quot; What you do is good .
Don &apos;t whisper into the cosmic music if you study physics . &quot; &quot; It was a role for me . He would come to me and spend hours with me .
And he wrote an email to me to join graduate studies .
In the background of the picture , my bike .
It turns out this picture was taken in my friend &apos;s home .
We had a dead Bob with a pile of devices to show us , Jig Venter , things about it .
We sat down talking about instant transformations , SARPL machines , modified transmission function , things like that .
Bob &apos;s death last summer was a loss of all of us .
Brent Moon influenced everyone who had music .
( Applause ) And I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do now . What I &apos;m going to do now — I hope you know about the pocket curved , almost triangular wave on this telescope from Helvetica .
Fantastic , I can get there , right ?
Children . Children are the topic I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
I wrote &quot; &quot; Children &quot; &quot; here , they &apos;re the ones I want to talk about .
I decided , for me , at least , my head is not enough .
So I think local and I act local as well .
I feel the best way to help anything is to help very local .
So after a Ph.D. in this , and a witness there , and so on .
I was talking about these things for some of the teachers in schools a year ago .
And one of them , some of them , come to me and say , &quot; So , why don &apos;t you teach ? &quot;
And I said to them , &quot; &quot; In the syringe , I study on studies — I had graduate students , and I also studied students in Baltius . &quot; &quot; No , they told me , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re interested in kids and buying them , why aren &apos;t you here in front lines ?
You translate your minds with your actions . &quot; &quot; Really . I study science for the eighth grade four times a week .
I don &apos;t visit them all the time and time .
No , no , no , no . I &apos;m taking absence .
I honor for the lunch hour . ( Applause ) That &apos;s not — no , no , no , I don &apos;t say that to applaud me .
I highly propose that it &apos;s good to do it for all of you .
Not just the visit every time and time .
Do a whole week teaching . Well , I study three quarters of the time , but it &apos;s still good enough .
One of the things that I did for science students is say to them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;ll teach you physics at the university level .
No calculus , no integration , I got rid of that .
You don &apos;t need to know what the triangles are .
But you need to know the eighth grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
I don &apos;t want to basically open up the seventh class and solve all the individual numbers .
We &apos;re going to do good physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought about doing now .
( Audio ) Oh , before I turn on this device , one of the things we did three weeks ago in my expedition — this is through lens , and one of the things we used lens is measuring the speed of light .
Students at MIT — with my help , of course , with the help of a very old telescope , measured the speed of light .
It was less than 25 percent of the actual value . How many eighth grade students do you know who measured the speed of light ?
In addition , we measured the speed of sound as well .
And I &apos;d like to measure the speed of light here .
And I was ready to do that and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Man , &quot; &quot; I was going to impose myself to people with power , and measure the speed of light .
And I still insisted on that . I &apos;m still involved in that , but it seems that the preparation for that here , we &apos;re going to need 10 minutes to prepare !
And we don &apos;t have time to do that .
So , next time , maybe , I &apos;m going to accelerate the speed of light !
But , until then , we &apos;ll calculate the speed of sound !
The obvious way to compute the speed of sound is to make the sound bounce out of something and then look for resonance .
But , perhaps — one of my students , her name is Ariel , she said , &quot; Can we calculate the speed of light using the wavelength equation ? &quot;
And you all know that the wave equation is : the frequency hits the length of any wave ...
It &apos;s a constant number . When the frequency increases , the wavelength of the wave goes up , the frequency goes down . So , when we have a wave here — here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — the more the sound is , the closer the sound is , the more things come together , when the sound is falling , the things expand .
Right ? This is one of the fundamental physics .
You all know that from eighth grade , right ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in the physics course of the eighth grade — and what they had to say to you — and how much I wish they did — is that when you multiply the frequency of a sound wave or light , you get a constant number .
And that constant number is the speed of sound .
So , to be able to measure the speed of sound , all I have to do is figure out how to frequency it . Okay , that &apos;s easy .
I have the frequency computer here .
Let &apos;s click A A . Here &apos;s A , almost .
Now , we know the frequency .
The frequency is 1.76 kilowatts . I &apos;m going to go along the wave .
Now all I have to do is go to another radiation , and the lower radiation represents my voice talking , right ?
So , whenever you talk , you &apos;ll see this on the screen .
I &apos;m going to put this in here , and as I &apos;m from the source , you &apos;ll notice the play .
Icelandic movements . We move between different peaks of the wave , coming out of here .
The physicists of you , I hear you flip your eyes , take me a little bit . ( Laughter ) To measure the length of the wave , all I have to do is measure the distance from here , a whole wave , to here .
From here to here is the length of the sound wave .
So , I &apos;m going to put the tape here , the scale tape here , move it backwards here .
I moved the microphone 20 cents .
0.2 meters from here , going back here , 20 cents .
Well , let &apos;s go back to Ms. Emo .
And we &apos;ll say that the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelength is 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s get to an answer .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 x 0.2 = 352 meters per second .
If you look for this value in a book , it &apos;s 343 .
But using these weak materials , and this bad drink — we can measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Very good .
All of this leads to what I would say .
Back to this picture that goes back to a million years in the past .
In 1971 , at the time of the Vietnam War , and he screamed , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I study physics : &quot; &quot; Landu , &quot; &quot; Lebastichwitz , Rezenic , and Haldi .
As I went home after a test , there was a violent phenomenon in the campus .
A violent phenomenon ! Momo is over . Stop .
There &apos;s a violent phenomenon in the campus , and the police are following me , OK ?
I walk across the campus . A police comes up and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student ! &quot;
He comes out with his gun . He fires !
And a gas bottle is about the size of a baseball pack going next to my head . Whooosh !
I breathe tear gas and then I can &apos;t breathe .
A police wore me with a gun .
They want to beat me on my head !
I said to myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get out of here ! &quot; &quot; He ran through the campus as fast as I could . I broke into the Higgs building .
He &apos;s one of the building of the bells .
The police is running behind me .
I get behind me on the first floor , second , third .
I get into one of the rooms .
A room leads to the horse tower .
The door closed behind me , and up , I walk across the place where it moves at an hour .
And I think , yes , the root of the pendulum corresponds to its role . ( Laughter ) I keep going , back .
I go to a place where the dead duck divides on a wall .
There &apos;s an hour , an hour , an hour .
Time is going backwards because I &apos;m inside the clock .
I think of the shots of Lawrence and the Uranian relativity .
I keep going up , and there &apos;s a place , in the back , you &apos;ve got to climb a wooden ladder to get to it .
I open a door above me , and there &apos;s a dome .
A punch , 10 feet tall .
I look out and I see the police hitting the students on their heads , launching the tear gas , and I see the students throw the powder on them .
And I wonder , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; And then I remember what the English professor said to me in high school .
When they pour the bells in the mold , they write on them scarf .
So , I scanned the bathroom waste from one of the bells , and I looked at it .
I still wonder , why am I here ? So , I &apos;d like to tell you the skeptical words on the Higgs Building : &quot; &quot; The truth is one .
Under this light , science and religion may come together towards the gradual evolution of humanity , from dark to light , from the horizon to its capacity , from prejudice to tolerance .
It &apos;s the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
A few years ago , I broke my house .
I drove home , it was the time at midnight , in Montreal winter , I was visiting my friend Jeff living on the other side . The heat scale on the front porch was pointing to 40 below zero — and not disturbing yourself and trying to figure out if 40 degrees Celsius , 40 degrees below zero was the same thing — it was very cold .
And as I stood on the front porch , I was feeling my pockets searching , and I discovered that my keys were not with me .
In fact , I can see it through the window , on the dining room table where I left them .
So I set up and I tried to open all the doors and the windows , and they were all fully accepted .
I thought I &apos;d ask for help from the ceremony maker , at least my mobile phone , but in the middle of the night it might take a while , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house to spend the night with him because I was going on a tomorrow morning flight to Europe and I needed passport and my suitcase .
So I was desperate and feeling that I freeze from the cold , I found a big rock and I used it to break the basement window , I removed the broken glass through which I found a piece of cardboard and used it to cover the opening , I decided that in the morning through my way to the airport , I could call the plot and ask it to repair the window .
It &apos;s going to be expensive , but maybe it &apos;s going to be less than the brainstorms are going to require in the middle of the night , so I think under these circumstances , that I was going to do this .
I &apos;m a neuroscientist , and I know a little bit about how the brain works under pressure .
They release the chloropol hormone that causes heart rate , and they regulate the adrenaline levels , and they confuse your thinking .
So the next morning , when I woke up from the few hours I had worrying about the gap in the window that I had to connect to the stomach and worry about the very low temperature , plus the meetings that I had in Europe , and , you know , with all this chocolate in my mind , I was distracted , but I didn &apos;t know that I was , because my thinking was distracted .
( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport office , I realized I forgot to bring my passport . ( Laughter )
So I quickly ran home in this ice and cold , and it took 40 minutes to bring it back to the airport at the right time , but they gave my seat to another person , so I stuck in the back of the plane near the water cycle in a seat that never bends me on a trip that took eight hours .
Well , I have a long time in the &apos; 80s to think about it without sleeping .
( Laughter ) And I started to wonder , are there things that I could do that are arrangements that should be put in place that could prevent bad things happening ?
Or at least if bad things happen , it will reduce the probability of being completely catastrophic .
So I started thinking about that , but my ideas didn &apos;t quite cross until about a month later .
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny Kahneman , the Nobel Prize winner , and I told him that I was kind of embarrassed about a secret story of glass , and , you know , forgetting the passport , and Danny told me that he was practicing something called the late cognition .
( Laughter ) It was something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Clain who had written about a few years ago , which was also called before death .
You all know what it means after death .
When a disaster happens , a team of experts come and try to figure out what &apos;s going on , right ?
Well , at some point before death , Danny explained that you &apos;re looking at what &apos;s happening in front of you and trying to figure out what &apos;s wrong and then trying to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or reduce their damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today is some of the things we can do at the pre-event .
Some of them are clear , and some of them are not quite clear .
I &apos;m going to start with that obvious .
All over the house , identify places that are easily lost .
This makes sense , but there &apos;s a lot of science to support this hypothesis based on how our spatial memory works .
There are areas in the brain that are known as hippocampus that have evolved over tens of thousands of years to track where important things are , where the beavers are , where we can find fish , where the trees are , where they live , where they live , and where they live .
The hippocampus is part of the brain that &apos;s expanding to the taxi drivers in London .
It &apos;s the part that allows the guns to find the winning .
And if you were wondering , someone actually did the experiment where they swallowed the sense of smell in the guns , and they could still find the winning .
They didn &apos;t rely on the sense of smell , they were using the hippocampus , and this mechanism evolved beautifully to find things .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move so much , it doesn &apos;t work for things that move around here and there .
That &apos;s why you lose the keys of the car and the glasses of reading and the passport .
So you have to find a place for your death — install a line on the door , or maybe a fake song .
And it &apos;s a special lesson for the passport .
And a particular table to put your reading glasses on it .
If you identify a place and you &apos;re accurate about it , you find things that are there when you look for them .
What about traveling ?
Take a picture of your mobile phone for credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , send it to your email in the cloud .
If you lose these things or steal them from you , you can replace them very easily .
These are some intuitions .
Remember , when you &apos;re under pressure , the brain releases the chlorol hormone .
Curtzol is toxic , and it causes the noise of thinking .
So part of the pre-event exercise is to realize that under pressure you &apos;re not going to be in your best case , and you have to put the arrangements in place .
And there is no situation that causes more anxiety than you have for medical decisions you have to take .
And at some point , each of us will be exposed to such situations where we have to make very important decisions about health care in the future or who we love to help them make a decision .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very special medical case .
But this seems like a document of all medical decision-making cases and actually making financial decisions and also social decisions — what kind of decisions you have to make that can benefit from mental evaluation of facts .
Suppose you went to the doctor and said to you , &quot; You &apos;ve got the analysis results , and it shows a high rise in cholesterol . &quot;
We all know that high blood cholesterol is associated with increasing the risk of being exposed to heart disease and blood vessels , the heart attack .
So you think high cholesterol ratio is not a good thing , and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to describe to you a drug that will help you reduce the cholesterol level , which is the &apos; 60s . &quot; &quot; And you may have heard about the &apos; 60s before , you know , it &apos;s one of the most used drugs in the world today , and you might know people taking it .
And you start thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! Get me Steaten . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this statistical point that you should ask about which most doctors avoid talking about and pharmaceutical companies avoid talking about a lot .
It &apos;s the number to be addressed .
Now what do we mean by that ?
It &apos;s the number of people who need a drug or a surgery or any medical procedure before you help one person .
You &apos;re going to ask what these crazy statistics are .
The result has to be one .
The doctor won &apos;t prescribe any medication if it &apos;s not useful to me .
But in fact , medical practice doesn &apos;t follow this way .
And that &apos;s not a doctor &apos;s fault , if someone &apos;s fault , it &apos;s going to be an ideal mistake .
We didn &apos;t discover the basic mechanisms that were so simple .
But Glaxo Smith Smith has estimated that 90 percent of the drugs have 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number required to treat it in 60 that describes a broad scale , how much do you think it should be ?
How many people should they take before helping one person ?
300 people .
This is according to the research that researchers , Jeremy Groben and Pamila Hartzgerald , proved by the Bloomberg.com independently .
I made sure these numbers myself .
300 people should have been given drugs for a year before a heart attack or a stroke or any harmful effect .
And maybe now you &apos;re going to start thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , a chance of 300 to lower my cholesterol level .
And why not , Dr. ? Do a chocolate anyway , but you have to ask other statistics , which is , &quot; &quot; Talk about side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
For this drug , it shows the side effects of five percent of the patients .
It includes terrible things , and they &apos;re getting muscles and pain in joints and pain in the digestive system , but you &apos;re going to get this idea , &quot; &quot; Five percent , it &apos;s not likely to happen to me though I &apos;m going to take the drug . &quot; &quot; But wait a minute .
Remember that under pressure , you can &apos;t think very clearly .
So you have to think about this already , you don &apos;t have to engage in a series of ideas immediately .
It takes 300 people , right ? One person was helped with five percent of the side effects , that &apos;s about 15 people .
You &apos;re more likely to hurt than 15 times before you get help from it .
I &apos;m not saying you should take the 60 or not .
I mean , you have to have this conversation with your doctor .
The morality of medicine imposes that is part of the principle of consent from science .
You have the right to get this kind of information to have a conversation about whether you want to pass it or not .
You may think that I &apos;ve come up with this number of voids for your shock , but actually it &apos;s a bit of a model , where this number needs treatment .
For surgeries that have been conducted on a broadband of men who are 50 years old who have received prostate because of cancer , it was the number that needed 49 treatment .
That &apos;s true , 49 surgeries have been conducted on everyone who has been helped .
And the side effects in this case showed 50 percent of the patients .
It includes sexuality deficit , weakened erection , and the urine sits down , punched into the straight , and the feathers sit down .
And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who gets this , they &apos;ll stay alive for a year or more .
So the idea before the event is to think already about the questions that you can ask that will push the conversation to a higher level .
I don &apos;t have to think about all these questions immediately .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
Because you have the choice most often : do you want a free dancer of pain or a long life that may be filled with pain until the end ?
There are things you have to talk about and think about now with your family and loved ones .
You might change your mind in an effective moment , but at least you &apos;ve had this kind of thinking .
Remember that the brain is secreting the cortisol under pressure , and one of the things that &apos;s happening at the moment is a set of jobs stopped .
There &apos;s a evolutionary reason for this .
When you &apos;re face-to-face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive attacker or sexual desire or immune system , because if your body doesn &apos;t do metabolism on these things and doesn &apos;t respond very quickly with it , it might become a food for a lion , and then it doesn &apos;t matter any of these things .
Unfortunately , one of the things that might regenerate during stress times is mental and moral thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have proved .
So we need to train ourselves to think about preconceptions like this .
And I think the important point here is to admit that each of us has a disability .
We &apos;re all going to have to fail every now and then .
The idea of thinking already about what these failures are to make arrangements that might help you reduce damage or prevent bad things in the first place .
Back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I came back from my journey , the organization installed a concert that agreed next to the door with the opening door , and you can remember the numbers .
And I have to admit that I still have piles of email that I didn &apos;t release anymore and piles of email that I didn &apos;t get .
So I &apos;m totally unregulated , but I see organizing as a gradual process and I will be .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning .
Are you up ?
They took me the card , but I wanted to ask you , did anybody write his name in Arabic on the card ?
One ! No one . Okay , no problem .
Whatever it was , not as old as time , my friend and I sat in a restaurant asking for food .
And I looked at the person who &apos;s helping us and said , &quot; Do you have a food list ? &quot;
And he looked at me in a jungle , and I thought he didn &apos;t call me very well .
He said no ! It &apos;s called Menu , or Menu , is it French ?
Come on , come on , take this one !
I feel like I was trying to talk to me and say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re the last girl in the world , I &apos;m not going to look at it !
Two words made them young for Pennsylvania governing a girl sitting behind , ignorance .
How do you talk that way ?
So at that moment I started thinking .
I succeeded , absolutely !
I &apos;m in my country and I &apos;m not supposed to speak my language ?
Where could this happen ?
How did we get to this point ?
Have I forget all my culture and all my ideas , all my intellectual stores and all my memories ?
The best memories of war may be childhood stories !
So I became one of them ?
Where does the logic of that ?
However , I tried to understand it .
And I don &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he got me .
Well , where can we use it ? We can all ask this question !
Well , you want us to use Arabic , so where can we use it ?
This is a reality that exists .
But there &apos;s another important reality that we want to think about and pay attention to .
The Arabic language or the native language .
Creativity in other languages has a fundamental condition , which is to master mother &apos;s language .
How ?
Jabran Khan Khan , when he started writing , was writing Arabic .
All his ideas , his imagination , his stomachs , the goats , the philosophy , inspired by this kid sitting in a village where he raised a certain smell on a particular voice on a particular idea .
When he started writing in English , he had a big intellectual statement .
Even when he was writing in English when we read his book in English , he smell the same smell ! We feel the same way .
We can imagine that he &apos;s the same who &apos;s creative in English , the same one that comes from the mountain from a village in the mountain of Lebanon .
So this is an example that nobody can say it &apos;s not true .
And this is a reality that developed people know .
The Germans , the French , the Japanese and the Chinese , all the people know this truth .
So the laws are forcing to protect their language .
And so you shrink that language .
And so it produces it , and it pushes huge amounts to its development .
So do we know more than we are ?
Well , if we &apos;re not from the first world , and we haven &apos;t come up with this sophisticated idea yet and we want to catch this urban world .
The countries like us , and they decided to pursue development and produce research and follow those countries like Turkey , Malaysia and others , those who carry their language as they climb this ladder , like the diamonds . They maintain it .
They made it close to them .
Because if you get any production from Turkey or other , it &apos;s not written in English , it &apos;s not local production .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it was a local product .
They &apos;re going to go back to being consumers , and consumers are stupid , as we do most of the time .
To innovate and to produce it was necessary to maintain their language .
It doesn &apos;t matter who and why .
Language is not just for talks , and any words come out of the mouth . Never .
Language represents certain stages in our lives , our emotional connection to it , and it relates to those terms .
Language is not a word , a letter , a letter , three matrix .
Why do we say this person understands and doesn &apos;t understand ?
So if I said to you , &quot; &quot; Free , Meditorium , Independence . &quot; &quot; Or if your son comes to you and says , &quot; &quot; Bad , did you live that history of liberty and so on ?
So what do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t feel a problem , I &apos;d like to leave on talking without an infection .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of something particular .
I have a friend Franklin who is married by a French person .
I was asking her one day about her loved ones and so on .
Or do they want to be liberated ?
( Applause ) Well , what did we do to protect Arabic ?
Although a lot of people said to me , what are you and this ?
Tell me , give me a hand , call you the head off . No problem !
We didn &apos;t say no , we wouldn &apos;t accept , and we did this language , and we did — we didn &apos;t follow this method because we wouldn &apos;t understand this way .
And when someone tells me this way , I hate Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) — we want to see the reality of our circumstances and to convince in a way that simulates our dreams , our daily and our aspirations .
A way to wear our clothes , and think about the same way we think about it .
After that , we launched another campaign in which the letters were subject on the ground .
Well , we should all not kill our language .
Because the language , if we kill it , we will have to look for identity .
We &apos;re going to go back to looking for existence .
We &apos;re going to go back to zero .
And this goes beyond just our loss of ability to be present and contemporary .
And then we made pictures of young men and young women , and they &apos;re destroying the Arab Eastern .
Pictures of young people and Cooples .
We &apos;re very , very Coal .
And who would say to me , ha ! You &apos;ve used the word &quot; &quot; English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;m adopting the word &quot; &quot; col &quot; &quot; — I invite them to assume how they are , so they &apos;ll give me a much more beautiful word of it , and they &apos;re consensus with our reality than we are .
So the idea is creativity .
Innovation in Mother is the way .
Let &apos;s start from now , from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel , create a short movie .
One novel can bring us back to the world .
You can bring Arabic back to the first center .
So it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution to the problem , but the solution is there !
But let &apos;s pay attention and believe in a solution , and we have to be part of this solution .
And in closing , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who tweets ?
But don &apos;t write &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; like ma32nd !
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s a disaster ! Because this is not a language .
Because here you enter a virtual world in virtual language .
It &apos;s hard for us to pick up beyond their levels at all .
So that &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there &apos;s a lot of things we can do .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of the foreign obstacle . ( Applause )
Sustainability is what and where and where it is .
What works with me is who and why .
I want to know the people who take my meals .
I &apos;d like to know what my impact on them .
And I have to know how they affect me .
I want to know how to hunt them .
I want to know how they depend on the water lap in their lives .
To understand all of this , we can change our perception of marine food from being goods to opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows us to celebrate the marine food that we &apos;re all aware of .
So what &apos;s the name of this ?
I think we call it living marine food .
Where sustainability is the ability to sustain and sustain , living is the ability to regenerate and progress .
Navy seafood allows us to develop a developing , dynamic system that recognizes our relationship to the oceans as a proposal resource that we engage in regenerate ocean resources and encourage their resilience .
It &apos;s more hopeful , it &apos;s more humane and a more useful way of understanding our environment .
The conservative evidence — the standard topic of a lot of seas conservation communities — it &apos;s a really useful and wonderful tool .
They &apos;re red and yellow and green for seafood .
The relationship is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , and think twice before you buy yellow .
But I think , that &apos;s not enough to eat just a green list .
We can &apos;t sustain this without measures to succeed in changing the wins of organisms on the yellow and red list .
But what happens if we just eat the green list ?
You have a yellow tuna that &apos;s been harvested from the Arctic here — coming from sustainable stocks .
They were harvested from the Pole — not exposure .
A very great deal for hunters . A lot of money . Local economies support .
But it &apos;s the lion of the sea . It &apos;s the most prevalent .
What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
Do I sit in a restaurant to eat a 16-pound piece of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
Maybe I &apos;m on the green list ? But I don &apos;t do anything good for myself or for you or for the oceans .
The idea is that we have to look at context , as a measure of our work in all of this .
For example , I heard that red wine is good for health — antioxidants and minerals — heart health .
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to drink a lot of it . I &apos;m going to be healthy .
Well , how many of these bottles are going to run out before you tell me I have a problem ?
Well guys , we have a protein problem .
We &apos;ve lost this sensitivity when it comes to our food , and we pay the price .
The problem is we &apos;re losing the price under the waves .
We fear that cost behind social acceptance to expand the waist .
And we fear the cost behind the brutal profits .
So the first thing about this idea of marine food is that it takes our needs to account .
The best way to represent marine food is perhaps , not through knife or snack , or strangers , but through my giant green table .
vegetables : Maybe not save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
Well , with respect , I want to say that that green dot might be the new blue .
We have to keep eating the best possible marine food , anyway .
But we also have to eat it with tons of vegetables .
The best part of living seafood is that it comes with half a cochlear with a bottle of Tasco and the lemon legs .
It comes with five versions of the mixed crystal with the audible debt and the grizzly patterns and a copped pile of Bello Kinoa with the orange cauliflower , very loud and restaurants and vapor from the outside with a little hot crater .
Oooh !
This is an easy sell .
And the best part is that all of these components exist for every family in Wal-Mart store in the neighborhood .
Jimmy Oliver is doing a campaign to save America from the way we eat .
Sylvia is doing a campaign to save the oceans from the way we eat .
There &apos;s a sequence pattern here .
Forget the nuclear Holocaust . It &apos;s the chocolate we should worry about .
We destroyed the land and then used the food that we produced to undermine ourselves in more ways .
So I think all the ways we eat is wrong .
And I think it &apos;s time to change what we expect from our food .
Sustainability is a complex process , but dinner is the reality that we have to recognize very much .
So let &apos;s start from there .
There were a lot of movements that were supporting green in our food system recently .
Dan Barbarber and Alice Wateras lead the wonderful green food revolution in all passion .
But green food is often represented in ways that don &apos;t make us think there &apos;s a responsibility for finance .
Just because it comes from green sources doesn &apos;t mean that we can treat it without considering shipping .
We have green shrimp .
We can make it . We have technology .
But we can never get any green bowl in every shrimp .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Health for the heart is an important part of living seas foods .
While we &apos;re trying to manage degradation in sea organisms , media is allowing us to increase the consumption of marine food .
Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , mothers and parents may be born again if they eat more seafood in their meals .
That &apos;s the funeral I don &apos;t want to pass .
But it &apos;s not just about marine foods .
It &apos;s about the way we look at our health .
Being a chef , I realized the easiest way for me was to reduce the size of the parts in my journalist .
A couple of things happened .
I made more money .
People started buying interviews and authority , because they knew they weren &apos;t just going to buy the major dishes .
People spent more time eating their meals , sharing with each other at eating .
In short , people got more than they came for , even though they got less protein .
They got more calories during their diverse meals .
They became healthier . They made more money .
That &apos;s great .
And with the environmental aspects of each plate , their presentation was with a large pile of human interests at the same time .
One of the other things that we did was start to divert the species that we offer — the little silver monkeys , the makrill , the monkeys were the most .
The reality , the salt , the oyster , the crystal , the tea , was — these were common dishes .
We were directing tastes towards more flexible and living choices .
That &apos;s what we need to support .
That &apos;s what the green list says .
But that &apos;s also how we can start to restore our environment .
But what about these huge predators , these familiar organisms , the green tuna list that I talked about before ?
Well , if it should , I have a recipe for you .
It works with any big fish in the ocean , and here it is .
I start with 16 megawatts of big fish .
Take a knife . I cut it for four parts .
Put it on four dishes .
Put those dishes with vegetables and open your best bottle of Burundi , light the grease and celebrate it .
I celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
I call your friends and neighbors and repeat this , maybe once a year .
I expect a lot of food .
I expect health , pleasure , family and community .
I expect to produce ingredients and bring dishes and eat meals all parts of communication for human benefit .
I was lucky enough that my father was a marvelous impression .
And it taught me since the young boy about the privilege that food represents .
I remember very well at my childhood .
It was enough protein that was presented with quantities of vegetables and vegetables and small amounts of vegetation , usually rice .
That &apos;s mostly what I eat today .
I get angry when I go to the State store .
I swear from meat .
It &apos;s like a bottle of proteins .
It &apos;s bizarre .
But all the serious news you &apos;re going to hear is that you &apos;re going to hear about the state of the ocean , and I have , unfortunately , a burden to tell you the best of it , and all the time , your mother was right .
Do all the vegetables .
It &apos;s very straightforward .
So what do we look forward to the meals ?
Well for health , I look forward to the good ingredients that are useful for my body .
For fun , I look for the butter and the sales and the interesting things that make the taste like cryptography about the comet .
For families , I &apos;m looking forward to a recipe that reflects my own history .
For society , we start from the very beginning .
There &apos;s no fact that anything we eat has a cosmic effect .
And we try to learn the best that we can about effect and then take the initiative to minimize that effect .
We &apos;ve seen images of our blue planet , our International Bank .
But more than just storing our resources . It &apos;s also the cosmic geography of communication that we call a dinner meal .
So if we all take what we need , then we &apos;re going to start sharing the rest , and we can start celebrating , we can start to restore .
We need to taste vegetables .
We need to taste less marine food .
We need to keep dinner .
Thank you .

Hi . I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world that builds buildings with paper , like these cardboard pipes , and this is the first exhibition I did using cardboard tubes .
And it was in 1986 , much before the world started talking about environmental issues and ecological issues started a series of quotes for cardboard tubes in order to use them as a building structure .
The testing of new materials is complex , and cardboard pipes have looked much stronger than I expected , and it &apos;s very easy to isolate against water , because it &apos;s from industrial materials , it &apos;s also possible to make it resistant to fire .
And then I built a temporary structure in 1990 .
And this is the first temporary building made of paper .
There are 330 tubes , 55 centimeter diameter , there are only 12 tubes that are 120 centimeters wide , or four feet wide .
You can see in the picture , it shows the water cycle .
And in the case of the toilet paper , you can tear something out of the wall and use it ! ( Laughter ) It &apos;s very useful .
In 2000 , there was a big exhibition in Germany .
I was asked to design for the building , because the exhibition topic was about environmental issues .
So they chose to build a wing with cardboard tubes and recyclable paper .
My design goals are not about building .
As far as it &apos;s about removing and replacing , because many countries are building a lot of wings , but half a year later it ends up and there &apos;s a lot of industrial waste left , so the goal of the building that I designed was to completely recycle it .
After the end of using it , we can restore it with the object .
And that was my design goal .
And I was very lucky to win another competition to build the second Bombido Center in France in Metz .
And because I didn &apos;t have a lot of money and I wanted to rent a office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on the surface of the Bombo Center in Paris ourselves .
So we came up with cardboard tubes and wood joints to complete a 35-meter desk .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . But there was one big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , if one of my friends wanted to see me , he had to buy a ticket for that .
And that was the problem .
And then I completed building the Bombido Center in a center .
It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and building that building was a big point for government in front of the environmental elements .
But then I was disappointed in my career as an architect , because we weren &apos;t helping others , and we weren &apos;t working for the community , we were working for the rich , the government , the developers .
They have wealth and power .
It &apos;s invisible .
So they used to employ us in order to transform that power and wealth into something visible across those unique structures .
This is our profession , even historically , this is the profession of engineers so far that we &apos;re doing the same thing .
It was a huge disappointment for us because we weren &apos;t working for the community even though there were a lot of people who lost their homes from natural disasters .
But I should say that this problem wasn &apos;t because of natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes don &apos;t kill people , but the collapse of buildings is what he did .
And that &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
And after these crises , people often need some temporary housing , but there were no architects to help that because we were too busy working for the elite community .
So I thought , even though we &apos;re architects and we &apos;re not civilians , we can participate in rebuilding temporary housing .
We can make it better .
And so I started working in disaster areas .
In 1994 , there was a major disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
My Hutu and Tutsi tribe killed .
There are over two million refugees .
But I was surprised when I looked at the shelter , and a refugee camp that the U.N. organized .
It was very fake , and people were frozen in cold , even though there were buildings in the rain season , in the refugee that the U.N. built , it was only providing a piece of plastic and had to cut down trees , to live something like this that that shows you in the picture .
But imagine there are two million people who want to cut trees .
They &apos;ve started deforestation , and it &apos;s faster , and it &apos;s a big environmental problem .
And that &apos;s why they started to provide city tubes and pre-industrial installations .
But it &apos;s so expensive that the eyes budget devised and then they went back to cut the trees again .
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation in order to use recycled paper pipes , because they &apos;re very powerful and very cheap , and my budget was only 50 dollars per unit .
We built 50 units to do an experiment to figure out how to harvest the units in terms of solidarity and humidity and white ants , and so on .
And then , a year later , 1995 , in Cubay , Japan , hit a very strong earthquake .
Almost 007 people were killed , and a city like Jata was burned in the fire that broke out after the earthquake .
And also , there were many Vietnamese refugees who were suffering and gathered in the Catholic Church , and the Church was destroyed .
So I went there and I proposed to the cave and said , &quot; Why don &apos;t we build the church again with cardboard tubes ? &quot;
And somebody said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , are you crazy ?
Did you see that the fire ate the building , what would another building suggest from paper ? &quot; &quot; He didn &apos;t trust me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started moving to Cuban , and I met the Vietnamese community .
They were living like this with very bad plastic caps like this one in the park .
So I proposed reconstruction . I collected donations .
And I made a shelter of cardboard tubes , and it was very easy to build these shelters by my students , and also very easy to demolish , I used beer boxes as foundations .
And I asked Kirin to help me because at the time , the beer company was making red plastic beer boxes , which didn &apos;t fit the color of cardboard tubes .
The color coordination is very important .
And I still remember , we imagined to send us all beer boxes , but we got empty from beer cans . ( Laughter ) I remember it was disappointing .
During summer with my students , we built over 50 million refugees .
And finally , the priest gave up his confidence to rebuild the church .
And he said , &quot; &quot; As long as you raise money yourself , and bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
It was supposed to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
And then in Taiwan , a big earthquake happened , so we decided to donate this church , so we broke it up and sent it back to them and rebuilt it by volunteers .
And it &apos;s there in Taiwan now as a permanent church .
So this building became a permanent building .
Which made me wonder , what is the permanent building and what is the temporary building ?
Even the building made of cardboard can become a permanent building if people like it .
And the armed concrete building can be temporary if people don &apos;t like it or if the goal is to build money .
And in 1999 , in Turkey , when a big earthquake happened , I went there and using local materials , I built camps .
And in 2001 , in West India , India was also built as a shelter .
And in 2004 in Sri Lanka after the Summer earthquake and the tsunami , I rebuilt the villages of Islamic fishermen .
And in 2008 , in the Sichuan Chengdu area in China , when nearly 70,000 people were killed , and a large number of schools were destroyed because of the dominant corruption between power and construction contractors .
I was asked to rebuild a temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with Chinese students .
And in one month , we continued to build nine seasons with over 500 square meters .
And these chapters are still used , even after the last earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , an earthquake hit the great Lakola earthquake .
And this is a very interesting picture : Berkeley showed up the former prime minister of Italy and the former Japanese Prime Minister , Mr. Superman , you know , because we changed the prime minister every year .
And they were very nice in a typical construction show .
And I proposed to reconstruct a makeshift music hall , because Lakola was very famous for music , and the earthquake destroyed all the celebration halls , and the musicians were flying around for Lakola .
So I proposed to the mayor of the town , my desire to rebuild a temporary hall .
And he said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring money so you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Berlussani and I attended from the top of the 8 group , and our former prime minister helped me raise money , and I got half a million Euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary room .
In 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly there , so I went to Santu Domingo , the next country , and we drove the car six hours to get to Haiti and collaborate with local students in Santa Domingo , we built 50 units of shelter with local cardboard pipes .
And this is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
After the earthquake and the tsunami , people were brought into big rooms like school districts for sports games .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
It causes physical and physical suffering .
So we went there to build pieces and help volunteer students and cardboard pipes , like this after designing and building simple frames of cardboard .
And yet , some of the people on the shelter didn &apos;t like the idea much , and they didn &apos;t want us to do it as they said , because simply , the control process of refugees becomes more difficult .
But it really needed to do that .
There was not enough horizontal space to build the one-floor government standard buildings like that .
Look at this . Even the buildings that the government adopted were like this very weak picture as a temporary building , and it was very narrow , and there was no way to store anything in addition to leaking water easily into it , and I thought we &apos;d build a multistory building because there was not enough horizontal space to build a single plate buildings .
So I proposed this to the mayor of the town when I was working with them in building boats .
And finally , I met a very nice mayor in the village of Angola in Miji .
I was asked to build a building of three stories in a baseball court .
So I used shipping containers and also helped me design and make all the furniture of the building to make it comfortable , and within the budget of the government , it was the area of the housing unit just like that , but it was much more comfortable .
Many people wanted to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I work in New Zealand , Cristotle .
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake , they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were killed there , and the most important cathedral in the city , which is a symbol of Cristich completely destroyed .
And I was asked to rebuild a temporary cathedral .
It &apos;s now under construction .
I like to keep the texts and the memorial buildings that people love .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is the brain of this child ?
If you asked this question 30 years ago , most people responded to psychologists , that this kid is not special , illogical and unaware of others — any one who can &apos;t see things from somebody else &apos;s perspective or understanding the causes and consequences .
In the last 20 years , human psychology has completely changed this picture .
So in some ways , we think this child &apos;s thinking is like the most brilliant scientist &apos;s thinking .
Let me just give you one example of that .
One of the things that this kid might think about , which perhaps operates his mind , is to try to guess what &apos;s going on in that other child &apos;s mind .
As we know , one of the hardest things we all have to get to what other people think or feel .
And perhaps the most difficult thing about all is to realize that what other people think or feel is really not as much as we think or feel .
And everyone in politics can see how hard it is to understand this to each other .
So we wanted to know if babies and my newborn babies could understand that deep truth about others .
And the question now is : How can we ask them ?
So babies , despite everything , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what he &apos;s thinking , all you &apos;re going to get is a beautiful flow of circular dialogue in his consciousness about little festivals and birthday returns , and things like that .
So how do we really steer the question ?
Well , it turns out the secret lies in the cauliflower .
And what we did — Pete Rachel and I , one of my students — is that we gave the little kids two layers of food : a dish of uncooked cats and another of the delicious pants in the form of a fish .
And all the young people even in Berkeley , love the piss and they don &apos;t like the uncooked cats .
( Laughter ) But what my house did next is it took a little bit of every dish .
And then she showed a expression like she loved that food or she didn &apos;t like it .
Sometimes she acts like she loves the knife and doesn &apos;t like the knife — just like a little kid or any normal person .
But in the other half of the number of times , what she was doing was taking a little bit of cauliflower and cheating , &quot; &quot; Hmm , knife .
It takes the knife time . Mmm . &quot; &quot; And then you take some pants , and you cheat , &quot; &quot; Be bitch .
It &apos;s been crying . It &apos;s horrifying . &quot; &quot; So it turns out that what you want was the opposite of what a child wants .
We did this experiment with 15 and 18 months old children .
And then she was extending her hand to the child and saying , &quot; Would you give me some of it ? &quot;
And the question here is : what would a child give , what he likes or what she likes ?
And the thing to note is that the kids were 18 months old , who could barely walk and talk , they would give her the knife if she loved the knife , and they would give her the knife if she loved the cauliflower .
On the other hand , the kids at the age of 15 months were staring at it for a long time if they showed their love to the cats , like they couldn &apos;t explain it .
But after staring for a while , they were giving her the knife , which they thought everyone had to love .
So there are two things that are remarkable about that .
One is that these young people in 18 months have actually reached that deep truth about human nature , which is that we don &apos;t always want the same things .
More than that , they felt that they had to do what other people wanted to get to what they wanted .
But even more interesting than that , if children are not able to do this suggests that these 18 months old children have learned that deep truth about human nature in three months since they were 15 months old .
So children know more and learn more than what we thought before .
And this is only one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that have demonstrated this .
But the question you might want to ask is : Why do children learn that much ?
And how do they do that in that short period ?
Despite everything , if you look at children in their careers , they look useless .
In many other ways , they &apos;re actually worse than that , where we need to dedicate a lot of time and effort just to keep them alive .
But if we turn our attention to evolution looking for an answer to that dilemma , why do we spend a lot of time taking care of young and useless kids , it turns out there &apos;s an answer .
If we look at lots and lots of different kinds of animals , not just us primates , but also other mammals , birds and even grades like churro and the title of the Mumbai , it will show us that there is a relationship between the length of a childhood that has some sort of brain size compared to the size of the body and their intelligence and their ability to adapt .
And one of the very obvious examples of this idea is , these birds are here .
On the one hand , we see the strange new Kalonia .
And strangers and cascades like target and pigmentation and such incredibly clever birds .
And their intelligence is in some ways the Spanish intelligence .
This is a bird on the cover of the Science magazine who learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our girlfriend &apos;s Home Library .
And chickens and ducks and geese and your parents are stupid birds as much as strangers .
So they &apos;re very good at click looking for love , and they &apos;re not going to do anything else .
Well , it turns out that young people , young Calonia , new Calonia , are not dependent on themselves .
Her mother depended on her mother to receive worms in her small , small mouths for a while that could reach two years , and it &apos;s a really long time in a bird &apos;s life .
The chickens arrive in a few months .
So childhood is the one that explains why you end up strangely at the cover of the Science magazine and ends up chicken in the soup plate .
There &apos;s something about a long childhood that seems to be associated with knowledge and learning .
So how do we explain that ?
Well , some animals , like chicken , look beautifully feared to donate just one thing .
So it seems terribly vague to click for love in one environment .
Whereas other creatures , like Western , don &apos;t donate to one thing , but they &apos;re very good at learning and exploring laws in different environments .
And of course , we humans are at the edge of the distribution as Western .
We have brains that are larger than any other animal .
And we &apos;re smarter , and more adaptive , more learning capability , we can stay in more and more different environments , we migrate and cover all the rest of the Earth but we went to outer space .
And our kids and our children depend on us for much longer than any other species .
My son is 21 years old .
( Laughter ) And until they &apos;re at least 21 , we still look at those worms in their empty mouths .
Well , what &apos;s the secret of that connection ?
Well , one idea is that this strategy , learning strategy , is a very powerful and very effective strategy to deal with the world , but it has one important player .
And this important disorder is that until you finish all that learning , you &apos;re going to be disabled .
So it &apos;s not that lovely to see the listeners contract to you and ask yourself , &quot; The scaffold or maybe the wheat will lead to purpose . Which is the best , you see ? &quot;
You want to know all of that before the consumer actually comes out .
And the way that evolution used — it seems — to solve that problem is to kind of divide the effort .
So the idea is to have this early period where we &apos;re under protection .
And we don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can use all those knowledge that we &apos;ve learned as young and leverage them to do things in the world .
So we can think of it as if babies and my talk are more like the R &amp; D part of the human race .
So they &apos;re well-protected blue sky researchers and they don &apos;t have to go out and learn and be good ideas , and we &apos;re like production divisions and marketing .
We take advantage of those ideas that we &apos;ve learned as young and put into use .
Another way to think about it is : instead of looking at the young and the infant as incomplete growth , we have to think of them as a different phase of evolution of the same kind — the larvae and the screws , for example — but they &apos;re actually the bright butterflies that are drifting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the larvae that slowly crawl through the narrow adolescents .
If that &apos;s true , if these young people are designed to learn — and this story about evolution confirms that children are hired to learn , this is what they &apos;re found for — they &apos;re expected to have very effective methods in learning .
And in fact , the mind of a child seems to be the most powerful computer learner on our planet .
But the real computers in their basketball are much more efficient .
And it happened recently in our understanding of machine learning .
And it &apos;s all based on the ideas of this man , the trailer : Thomas Paris , a statistician and an 18th-century mathematician .
And what Bayes basically did was to create a mathematical method using the theory of possibilities to discriminate and describe how scientists came up with facts about the world .
And what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they see appropriate to start with .
And they start testing it and compare it to evidence .
And evidence makes them prepare that hypothesis .
Then they test the new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way to do that .
And these mathematical rules are the basis for the best machine learning programs that we have right now .
And about 10 years ago , I suggested that little kids might do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on behind these beautiful brown eyes , I think it &apos;s something that looks like this .
This is the idea of the meadows .
So I think these young people are actually doing complex calculations using the coverage possibilities that they &apos;re reviewing to figure out how the world works around us .
Well , now that sounds really hard to explain .
We know , even adults when you ask them about statistics , they look very stupid .
So how does it make sense that these young people do statistics ?
And to test that we used our machine called the Bilkit detector .
And it &apos;s a box that lacks up and plays music when you put on it specific things , not when you put other things .
Using this simple device , my lab and other labs have done studies showing how awful little kids are in learning about the world .
Let me just mention one of them that Tomarr and I did , my student .
If I showed you this detector , the most likely idea to start with is to alert the detector is by putting the mold on the detector .
But in fact , this detector works in a rather strange way .
Because if you put a mold on it back and forth , it &apos;s hard to think about from the beginning , the detector works twice every three times .
However , if you do the most likely thing , which is to put the mold on the detector , the detector works twice every six times .
So the less likely hypothesis is the most ideal in terms of evidence .
So it seems to be the most effective strategy from the other .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did , where we gave kids four years old this kind of evidence , and we asked them to make the detector work .
Certainly , the children used four years old this evidence to skip the mold over the detector .
And there are two interesting things about that .
The first is : again , remember that these are four year-old children .
They &apos;re still learning the lens .
But without aware of them , they do these very complex calculations that will give them a measure of the cop probability .
And the other interesting thing is that they use this evidence to come up with an idea , and to put a hypothesis about the world of the ocean , it might seem very , very likely at first .
And in studies that we &apos;ve done in my lab recently , like this , we &apos;ve shown that children are four years old are actually more skilled in getting to very distant hypotheses than adults when they &apos;re given the very important task to do .
So in those situations , children use statistical science to learn more about the world , but as we know , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if kids also do experiments .
When kids do their experiments , we call it &quot; &quot; intervene in everything . &quot; &quot; And sometimes we call it &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; And a lot of interesting studies have recently shown that this is actually a bit of an experimental research program .
And here we see one of the Christine League &apos;s lab .
And what Crastine did was to use Bilkit detectors .
And what she did was she showed the kids that the yellow rows fire the detector while the red doesn &apos;t make it work , and then I showed them a very popular case about that base .
And what you &apos;re going to see now is how this little baby will experience five hypotheses over two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : What if we did this ?
Just like the other hand .
Alison Jobs : Well , so his first hypothesis was proved to be mistaken .
( Laughter ) Boy : This one lights up , and this is : nothing .
AJ : Well , here &apos;s where he comes out of his experiments .
Boy : What makes this light ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t see .
AJ : Every scientist knows absolutely this hopelessness .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , that &apos;s because this should be put like this , and this should be like this .
AJ : Well , the second assumption .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AJ : Well this is his next idea .
He asked the trial system to do this , to try and transfer it to the same place .
But that didn &apos;t work either .
Child : Oh , because the light comes out of this one , not from that .
Oh , underneath this box has electricity here , and this has no electricity .
AJ : Well , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It lights up .
So when you put four .
So we need four on this to put two on top of this to slow down .
AJ : Well here &apos;s his fifth assumption .
In fact , this particular child — this is a particularly loving child and a regulatory thinking system , but what Christian discovered is that this is actually very natural .
If you think about how kids play , or when you ask them to explain something , what they &apos;re doing is actually a series of experiments .
This is a very natural thing for children in four years .
Well , how does it feel to be this kind of organism ?
How does it feel like one of those bright butterflies that can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
Well , if we go back to these psychologists and philosophers , many of them said that babies and young children barely see around them if they have consciousness .
And I think right is the exact opposite .
I think young kids are actually more aware of us as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
The adult &apos;s awareness of it seems a little bit like a fluorescent exploration .
So what happens to adults is we decide that something is relevant and important , and we have to pay attention to it .
And our awareness of that thing that we pay attention becomes very fast and fake and everything else becomes dark .
We also know something about how the brain does that .
And what happens when we focus our attention is that the frontal cortex , which is sort of the executive part of the brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain more flexible , and we &apos;re more and more able to learn , and stop any activity in the brain .
So we have a very focused attention , very moving movement .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young people have a awareness that &apos;s closer to a light from it to a fluorescent exploration .
So young kids are never brilliant at narrowing their attention to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at understanding how much information is from so many different sources at the same time .
And indeed , if you look at their brains , you find them covered with these very efficient neurotransmitters in the search of learning and flexibility , and the associated parts that aren &apos;t yet shown .
So when we say that young kids can &apos;t focus their attention , what we really mean is they can &apos;t focus their attention .
So they don &apos;t want to get rid of all these interesting things that might tell them something and just pay attention to the important thing .
And this is the kind of attention , the kind of awareness , that we expect from those butterflies that are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way to test the sense of child awareness and we &apos;re adults , I think the best way to think about situations where we find ourselves in a new situation that we &apos;ve never experienced before — like in love with a new person , or visit a new city for the first time .
So what happens then is that our consciousness doesn &apos;t narrow , it expands , and those three days in Paris look like it &apos;s paying attention and expertise more than all those months that you and you &apos;re like the Zumbian walking and talking and having meetings at university and coming home in a mechanical way .
And by the way , that coffee , the wonderful coffee that you were drinking down , is actually controlling the effect of these neurotransmitters in young people .
So how does it feel to be a little kid ?
It &apos;s kind of like falling in love and you &apos;re in Paris for the first time after you drank three Spanish peaks center .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a great way to live , but it seems to lead you to wake up Kikia at 3 a.m. ( Laughter )
It &apos;s also good to be a witness .
I don &apos;t want to engage in talking about the magnificence of young children .
It &apos;s good to be a witness .
We can connect our shoes and crossing the road based on ourselves .
And it makes sense to do a lot to push young people to think as adults think .
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , with a minority open and a desire to learn , a vast imagination , creativity and innovation , and if for at least a part of the time , we have to pay adults to think closer as children .

I &apos;m going to share with you my story about how I became an activist in fighting HIV and HIV .
The name of my campaign is Singh .
In November of 2003 , I was invited to participate at the launch of the Nelson Mandela Foundation called 4664 , an institution that means fighting HIV and HIV .
And the 4664 number was the number that Mandela was carrying when our prisoner was on the island of Robin .
And this is my picture with Yosemen Door on the concert platform , and I was very excited about my time .
The next day , all the singers were invited to join the Mandela tour in Ruben Island , where he gave a speech to the press of the world standing in front of his previous cell .
And you can see the bars that we have in the picture here .
And it was a wonderful memory in the lives of most of us .
At that moment , Mandela told the global press that there was a hypothetical complaint done on his country &apos;s land , which was named after the time of apartheid with a rainbow , there were thousands of people dying every day who were facing death as the first front forces , who were the most vulnerable categories of women and children .
And I was so influenced by my thinking that I was a woman and a mother at the same time , and I didn &apos;t know that the HIV epidemic was affecting women in this direct way .
So I committed to that issue , when I left South Africa , when I left Cape Town , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s something I have to talk about .
And I &apos;ve been involved in all the activities of the 46664 Foundation , one of which I can participate in , and I &apos;ve given journalist reviews , interview views , and talk from my platform of singing about it with a great effort that &apos;s worth the respect that Mandela is doing about this .
Everyone in this world respects Nelson Mandela , everybody appreciate the effort of this person .
But did everyone know what was going on in South Africa , a country that had the largest percentage of HIV in the world ?
I think if we were to go out on the street and tell people what was going on there , the women would definitely hit .
And I was very fortunate a couple of years ago , when I met Zucky Ahmed , who &apos;s the founder of the &quot; &quot; Move to treatment , &quot; &quot; which is an activist , a wonderful campaign organization .
I met him in one of the activities of the 4664 Foundation .
And he was wearing T-Shirent like the one I &apos;m wearing now .
It &apos;s a way , and it &apos;s a tool to tell people that you &apos;re multi-positive with HIV who live with HIV .
Because of that good-looking view , people who are looking at this virus , this is a tool that says , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
I need to get them out of the dark corners , I need to get them out of the public , and I &apos;ve become part of the &quot; &quot; move towards treatment . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m very proud of that because it &apos;s a very wonderful organization .
It &apos;s an organization that &apos;s based on 80 percent of its members on women that most of them carry HIV .
And they &apos;re working in public to fight this virus .
And to support people , to support those who live directly with the symptoms of this virus .
They have educational activities and educational programs .
It &apos;s about taking a look of shame and looking at the individual outside the square .
It &apos;s a really cool job .
And my campaign , the Singh campaign , is to support the action of treatment by raising awareness and fundraising .
And most of the donations that I &apos;ve been able to collect were going directly to the FDA and getting their amazing activities that they &apos;re doing that are still being done today in South Africa .
This is my Singh campaign .
The Singh campaign is basically made up of me — it &apos;s about three to four wonderful people who help me and support me .
I &apos;ve traveled around the world in the last two and a half years to about 12 countries .
This is a picture of me in Oslo in Norway , and I got a generous donation , and here &apos;s a sitting in Hong Kong trying to collect fundraising .
And here in Johannesburg , where I gave the opportunity to play the white community there , to the middle class , who came out of the show , they dismissed their defense , because I used some videos that touched their hearts , which was to move a real image of the tragedy that was happening there that people were trying to shake their eyes because they were the weaker of the interface , because they didn &apos;t know what the right solutions were .
Aaron Mottwidi , the Minister of Health , came to the ceremony , and I had an opportunity to meet him , and he was pleased to have a complete commitment to making a real change on this issue , which is very much needed today .
This is the picture of the Scottish Parliament .
I &apos;ve always become a blog in Scotland and for HIV .
And I was showing them some of my experiences in this field and trying to publish awareness about this issue .
And here in Edinburgh with a wonderful group of children .
Most of these kids are dying of HIV .
And here &apos;s a picture in New York with Michelle Sedapi , the General Association of the UN AIDS program .
And I felt very proud when Michelle invited me a few months ago to become the embassy of the U.N. program .
And in this way , I was driving my platform in direction and awareness , and I was pushing my voice to reach further places .
The goal of the U.N. program to look at the world has completely eliminated the risk of HIV transmission from mothers to their children in 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we think we can get there with political will .
And that can happen .
And here I am with a woman who is HIV-positive , who is smiling , both smiling , because we are very confident , because this young mother receives adequate treatment , who &apos;s going to die in her lifetime to care about her young daughter who &apos;s going to kill her .
And you get a child with an antiretroviral therapy from mother to child born , which means that the child is born without HIV .
This is a prevention that has been given since the beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to get rid of the AIDS epidemic .
Now I want to end with a short story about Evelly .
This is Evelyn , and she &apos;s connecting me everywhere I go .
And I tell her story to everyone , because it &apos;s one of millions of days of HIV and HIV .
Evelyn &apos;s mother was HIV-positive , and she died of AIDS symptoms .
Evelyn is HIV-positive , and she was born with the virus .
And here &apos;s her picture , and she &apos;s seven years old , no more than one child &apos;s weight .
At this point in her life , she had very advanced HIV , and she had pneumonia .
And I met her in a hospital in Western Kip , and I spent every afternoon with her , she &apos;s a wonderful girl .
The doctors were there , the nurses , very nice , very special .
They put Evelly in their own food system , and they adopted it very well .
And nobody knew when she was going to leave the hospital when we shot a film about her , and we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive AIDS .
It was really , really emotional , and I left the whole team affected by this unique experience that I fell in front of us , this kid , you know , I made a great story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa and we met Evelly again .
I started to feel blurry in my body . I don &apos;t know that you can see my hair from here , and I started to feel a sense of shame .
Because I know what I &apos;m about to show you .
Evelly improved very extraordinary .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
( Applause ) This applause , in fact , is the right to doctors and nurses who took care of Iville .
They &apos;re all better at improving and transforming the case of Evelyn .
And I want to say to every one of you in the audience here , if you think that every mother and every child in the world deserves to get treatment and nutrition to achieve the FBI targets that the U.N. has put , especially the fifth and sixth target of that plan , that all governments around the world have to be committed to achieve and especially in the Sahara Africa can stand up for you right now .
I think it &apos;s possible to say that everybody here in this room thinks that .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago in the ancient Soviet Union , a team of engineers were moving around a large body secret across the abandoned countryside .
With them , they hoped that human minds could be the first to open up space .
The rocket was huge .
He walks in his nose a silver ball inside her radio .
On October 4th , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One Russian scientist then wrote that we were about to create a new planet , which we would call Sputnik .
In the old days , explorers like Fasco da Gamma and Colombia are fortunate to open the globe .
Now we have the fortune to open space .
It will cover us who come into the future , watching snippets from Sputnik , my fifth documentary , which I doubt is complete .
It tells the story of Sputnik and the story of what happened in America as a result .
For days after all , Sputnik was a remarkable museum .
A moon of human making can be seen by the average habitat , showed horror and pride that humans have finally launched a body into space .
But only three days later , on a day called the red Monday , the journalists and the politicians and their belief , that Sputnik evidence that our enemy has preceded science and technology and that they are now able to attack us with the hydrogen bombs using Sputnik rockets .
So she did the art , and she didn &apos;t retire .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three trauma that had America , historians say it was the equivalent of Bearl Harbor and September 11 .
The missile of missiles revolved .
The gun dawn .
The space race started .
Within a year , the Congress had massive gun increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
And the reaction went far beyond the weapon .
For example , some here remember this day , June 1958 , the National Defense Service , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities underground .
Or a poll that showed that seven out of every 10 Americans believe that a nuclear war will start , and that at least 50 percent of the population will kill .
But Sputnik has made great changes as well .
For example , some in this room went to school with a grant because of your tongue .
The support of engineering , mathematics and science in general — exploded .
And Vincent Sir turns out that Sputnik led directly to advanced research agency , the Internet , and of course NASA .
My documentary film shows how a free society can be driven by people who know the use of media .
But it also shows how we can turn what seems at first as a bad situation to something that is in a very good sentence for America .
Sputnik will soon come out .
In closing , I &apos;d like to take a minute to thank one of the investors from the former TED leaders , Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .

Thank you , Chris .
Today , I noticed a woman associated with a coincidence where I live and declared that I am &quot; disappointing . &quot; &quot; Which means that when it comes to logic and blaming I don &apos;t even pray it because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; disappointed . &quot; &quot; So when my father asks a question and my answer is a guarantee for an urban proposal , there &apos;s never a punishment for it ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of that , &quot; &quot; I can be wrong with my father , and I can be wrong .
And when my son says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the good thing that &apos;s going on with you , son ? &quot; &quot; I say , sometimes in the class I might stop pouring my ideas to ask , &quot; &quot; You ! Those books have never been about my feet ? &quot; &quot; Yes , I decided to deal with the three languages equally because I &apos;m a &quot; apple . &quot; But who controls the schizophrenia ?
Because English is multifaceted speech , and it &apos;s subject to unlimited variability . Now you might think it &apos;s ignorant to speak in unintentional English , but I &apos;m here to tell you that Americans &quot; &quot; The Chinese &quot; &quot; seem like the divine for the British . &quot; &quot; So when my teacher comes to the section and says , &quot; &quot; Hello , I stop him saying , &quot; No , you &apos;re not the right law enforcement , but I &apos;m going to say this is great .
The word &quot; &quot; unprecedented &quot; &quot; has never been the present term , because this is the principle of English &quot; &quot; if I had an acoustic capacity , I would sing this from the top of any mountain , from all suburbs , from every neighborhood , because the god of this one language is the only language that recorded &quot; &quot; fine . &quot; &quot; So I don &apos;t always stand in front of you , but I don &apos;t always recognize the speech , but I can speak at the same time as a teacher , and I can speak at home .
And then I change it so that I don &apos;t feel the other bored later , sometimes I win two languages when I use the other inside of the body , but when I mix them all , I feel crazy like I cook in the bathroom . I know I &apos;ve had to borrow your language , because my language has been stolen , but you don &apos;t expect me to talk about your entire history , while my history is all of these mysterious words from the great audiences that I &apos;ve been singing at the top of the history .
I speak a guardian language to remind us that our status quo is not mysterious . I &apos;m tired of negative images that make people worrying . What you haven &apos;t seen stealing a bank , stop describing my hair bad . I &apos;m tired of that fake racism , so don &apos;t take it so good that your hair is known to provide donations as much as you would expect , as I would expect them to be able to be able to commit with the sum of your own group .
This is not an invitation to ignorance , this is a language celebration . So I put &quot; &quot; 3D Allen &quot; &quot; on my last job request . I can help you create a consumer market , all I wanted them to know , and when they call me for a job interview , I &apos;ll be very happy to show them that I can say , &quot; What &apos;s good ? &quot; &quot; And of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because I &apos;m proud of you .

Good morning . Magic is an excellent way to keep the curve of reality , to make it possible today what science will make tomorrow .
And as a cyber magician , I integrate the elements of illusion and science to give us an idea of how we can test future technologies .
You may all have heard of the Google Glass Project .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look through it and the world that you see is enhanced by data : the names of places , the world and the buildings , and perhaps one day , maybe even the names of strangers that you pass on the street .
So this is my glasses for illusion .
It &apos;s a little bigger . It &apos;s a prototype .
And when you look through it , you take a ridiculous look at the brain of a cyber trickster .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a toy paper . Any paper will work .
Like this . Let me mark it so that we can recognize it when we see it again .
Okay . Very big sign .
And let &apos;s go back to the package , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s start .
( Music ) Voice : The system is ready . Gary gets the picture .
MT : For those of you who don &apos;t play with cards , play cards are made of four different organizations : the red hearts , the trees , the daily hearts and the black hearts .
The cards are among the oldest symbols , and they &apos;ve been interpreted in many different ways .
Now , some people say that the four groups represent the four seasons .
There &apos;s spring , and summer , fall and sound : my favorite chapter is winter . MT : Yeah , it &apos;s my favorite one .
The winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when the warmth turns into cooler , and the water turns into ice , and then everything disappears .
And there are 13 cards in each group . ( Music ) Voice : Every card represents a phase of the 13th Airport .
MT : So here we see the islands , and here we see the tide , and the moon in the middle .
Voice : The moon is one of the most powerful symbols of magic .
MT : There are two colors in the play paper .
There &apos;s red and black , representative of the continuous change from day to night .
Voice : Marco , I didn &apos;t know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And incidentally , there were 52 cards in the play paper , just like there were 52 weeks a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you add the spots on the play cards together , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days a year , the number of days every birthday .
Me . ( Screaming sound ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell me , otherwise you won &apos;t .
MT : Well , actually , it was my sixth birthday when I received my first play cards , and since that day , I traveled all over the world to perform magical shows for boys and girls , for men and women and husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And from these ? MT : Ah , they were the riots . They watched .
Wake up .
Jocker : Wow . MT : Are you ready to be at the party ?
Jocker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you have .
Jocker : I introduce you to my gecko stick . MT : Ah . I feel .
Jocker : Oh , wow , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I &apos;m performing for a different kind of audience .
I assure you .
Voice : The teacher card was revealed . MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how to be magic ? Is it a job from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ?
Of course not ! You have to do it all the time .
I don &apos;t mean literally 24 hours , seven days a week .
All the time it has a kind of exaggeration , but it requires practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that should be a superpower evil for nature . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Bear .
Well , so , I &apos;m just saying , no , no .
And in fact , in German language , it &apos;s Najin Nine . ( Laughter ) Magic is not that dense , but I have to warn you , if you ever play with someone who distributes cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of winning them are 4,165 for one .
MT : Yeah , but I think my hand is better . We overcome rare possibilities .
Voice : I think you &apos;ve got Miladdock &apos;s wish . MT : And this leaves me with another , and the most important card of all : that &apos;s a very big tag on it .
And unlike anything else we just saw , hypothetical or L.A. Voice : The expected card was revealed .
MT : This and without question is the real thing .
MT : Goodbye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I worked at MIT for 44 years , and I attended the first TED Conference .
And the third issue is kind of less obvious .
Did you all agree ? No , not entirely .
I &apos;m going to buy it . I have a lot of money .
I have a lot of money that keeps me forever .
I grew up in Bihar , the poorest and most vacant in India , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of candy in front of the house .
My brothers and I attacked her and my father came home .
And it &apos;s very angry , and I still remember how we cry when that Rover was half empty , and we took off our hands .
Later , I realized why my father got mad .
It was this candy from a contractor who was trying to make my father reward him with a government contract .
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and his situation was strictly against corruption , despite the harassment and threats .
His conflict was individually , because Bayamour was also the most desolate state in India , where blind employees were investing themselves , instead of serving the poor who had no way of expressing their carbon when their children were food and not education .
And I had a similar experience that fascinated my grandfather , when I wandering around the remote villages to study poverty .
As I moved from one village to another , I remember that day when I was very hungry and confused , and I was about to collapse , in the wake of the burn under a tree , and at that moment , one of the largest village men invited me to his hut and fed me generously .
I really realized that what I was feeding my whole family for two days .
This originally challenging and changed my goal in life .
I became a leader to give .
Next , I joined the World Bank , who strive to fight poverty by transforming aid from rich countries to poor countries .
My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Uganda financial ministry so that they could get our loans .
But after spending loans , I remember finding one of my trips to Uganda newly built schools without books or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and poor again without voice or resources .
It was Bihar again .
Bahar is a challenge in development . The poorest is surrounded by corruption .
Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than a dollar and a quarter of a day , and the work that I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to solving these problems in 1944 , when Egyptians came to World War II , 500 founders , and a single organization , and they came together in New Hampshire , the United States of America to set up the BP institutions , including the World Bank .
And that traditional approach in development , consists of three key elements , or transfer resources from rich countries in the north to poor countries in the south , accompanied by a list of reforms .
Secondly , the development institutions that directed these transit processes were mysterious , and they decided to transparency about what was funded , and what results they achieved .
Third , working in the developing world was with a narrow class of government elites interacting with citizens , who are the end beneficiaries of development aid .
Today , each of these elements opens up as a result of major changes in the global stage .
Open knowledge and open aid and open management , all together represent three fundamental transformations that transformed development , which also has a huge amount of problems that I &apos;ve seen in Uganda and Bihar .
The first of these major transformations is open knowledge .
You know , developing countries today are simply not going to accept the solutions that are given to them by the U.N. or Europe or the World Bank .
They get inspiration , their hopes , their practical skills , from the success of emerging economies in the south .
They want to know how China was able to raise 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , and how the Ababondres Opportunity Program improved the educational and nutritional level of millions of children .
This is the current ecosystem of open knowledge not only transmitted from the north to the south , but from south to south , and even from south to north , even the Mexican Aberonaires today inspires New York City .
And as transportation processes open from the north to the south , they also open up the development institutions that are directed by transportation processes .
And this second transformation : open aid .
Recently , the World Bank opened its data reserves for public use , outsourcing 8,000 economic and social index for 200 countries over 50 years and more , which led to a global competition to crowdsource resources to innovative applications using this information .
Today &apos;s development institutions are also opening up projects that are funded for public investigation .
Take a geographic map . In this map of Kenya , the red dots show all the schools that are funded by donor directors as the green shadow increases , the more children have no schools .
This simple mixture reveals that donor troops have not funded any schools in areas where there are more children without schools than there are new questions : Is Environmental assistance targeting who needs our help ?
In this way , the World Bank now has a geographic map of 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and donors are using a shared platform to map all its projects .
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and responsibility to help .
And that brings me to the third , and in my opinion , the most important shift in development : open management . Governments today open up as citizens demand to hear their voices and accountability .
From the Arab Spring to Anna Hazarar movement in India , using mobile phones and social media is not just for political accountability but for growth accountability .
Governments are providing services to citizens ?
So for example , many governments in Africa and East Europe open their budget to the public .
But , you know , there &apos;s a big difference between the public budget and the budget that &apos;s accessible .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really available or understandable for a normal citizen trying to understand how government spends its resources .
To address this problem , governments use new tools to visualize budget so that they become more able to understand the public .
In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those areas that have low school spending but good education results , and the red color shows the opposite .
The tools like this have contributed to transforming an entire letter of ambiguous documents into visual information understood to the public , and what &apos;s interesting is that with this openness , there are new opportunities for citizens today to create opinion and share with the government .
So in the Philippines today , parents and students can actually start their real opinions on Checkool.org , or using the SMS scheme , whether teachers or textbooks are in school , the same problems that I saw in Uganda and in Bihar .
And the government responds . So for example , when reports on this site reported that 800 students were at risk because school reforms stopped because of corruption , the Ministry of Education and education in the Philippines took quick procedures .
You know what &apos;s interesting is that this innovation is now spreading from south to south , from the Philippines of Indonesia , Kenya , Columbia , and beyond .
In the peacehouse , Tanzania , even the poorest communities were able to use these tools to express their ambition .
This is what the Delta map looks like in August , 2011 , but within a few weeks , college students were able to use mobile phones and open-source platform to dramatically change the entire community infrastructure map .
And what &apos;s very exciting is that citizens were then able to give their information about the health points or the water that don &apos;t work , and they &apos;re all in the red bubbles that you see , that have provided visually to the voices of the poor collectively .
Today , even Bihar spins and opens up a committed leadership that forms transparent and comfortable government and responds to the poor .
But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in openness or in the service of the poor , and that &apos;s a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are the only warriors like my father and many others , and the only key to the development work is to help these only warriors in cooperation so that they can overcome the odds together .
For example , today , in Ghana , two brave Egyptians of civil society and parliament and government , and it has opened up for the transparent decades in the oil sector , driven by this in Parliament right now making complaining nodes .
These examples give new hope , new possibilities for problems that I witnessed in Uganda or my father faced in Bihar .
Two years ago , on April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was too late at night , and at the age of 80 , he was writing a public interest in 70 pages against corruption in a road project .
He &apos;s not a lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day , and he won the court , but later that evening , he fell , and he died .
He fought until the end , by the cost of having a debate in fighting corruption and poverty , it doesn &apos;t just have to be honest government officials , citizens have to support each other to make their voices heard .
This became its limitations in life and the journey in which I traveled between that reflected the change in the landscape of evolution .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that we &apos;re in the World Bank , and we embrace these new trends , a big difference about my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
And we need to radical openness in development so that knowledge flows in multiple directions , the practitioners are inspired , and the aid becomes transparent , responsible and effective , then governments and citizens are opening up and sharing and enabling reforms with government .
We need to enhance these transformations .
And if we do that , we will find that the collective voices of the poor in Bihar are heard , in Uganda , and beyond that .
And we &apos;ll find that textbooks and teachers will appear in schools for their children .
We will find that these kids , too , have a real opportunity to break their way out of poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Imagine that there &apos;s a plane on 250 children and a baby about to fall , if you know how that stopped , would you do ?
Now imagine there are 60 planes full of children under the age of five falling every day .
That number of children didn &apos;t get to age five .
Sixty-six million children will never get to age five .
Diarrhea and pneumonia are two of the big killers of children under the age of five , and what we can do to prevent those diseases is not the smartest technological innovations .
It &apos;s one of the oldest innovations in the world : a soap piece .
The hand washes the soap , the habit that we all do , can reduce the infection of half , and you can reduce the respiratory infection of a third .
The hand washed soap , it could have an effect to reduce the risk of influenza , turcoma , SARS , and very recently in the case of cholera and outbreak Ebola , one of the major prevention methods is to wash hands with soap .
The soap hands keep kids in schools .
It prevents infant death .
The hand washed soap one of the most effective ways in terms of the price that protects children &apos;s lives .
It can protect more than 600,000 children every year .
This parallel prevents 10 Gambo airplanes full of infants and children from falling every day .
I think you agree with me that it &apos;s a very useful public health approach .
So now let &apos;s take a minute .
I think you need to recognize people .
Who &apos;s next to you . Why don &apos;t you blame them .
Please give each other a hand .
Okay , get in touch with you .
They really look good .
Okay .
So what if I told you that the person who I &apos;ve ever received actually doesn &apos;t wash his hands when he comes out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) He &apos;s not going to look good anymore , right ?
Very disgusting , you probably agree with me .
Well , the statistics actually show that four out of five people don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
And the same thing , we don &apos;t do when we have a luxury toilet , where running water and soap are available , it &apos;s the same thing in the country where child mortality is really high .
What is this ? Is there no soap ?
Actually , the soap is there .
In 90 percent of the homes in India , 94 percent of the homes in Kenya , you will find a soap .
Even in countries where they get less , like Ethiopia , we get to 50 percent .
So why ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
Why is it that Milk , this little boy I met in India , doesn &apos;t wash his hands ?
Well , in the Milk family , the soap uses the bathroom , and it uses the washing of clothes , and to wash the dishes .
His parents sometimes think it &apos;s a waste commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a closet .
They &apos;ll keep it away from them so they don &apos;t threaten it .
On average , in the Milk family , they &apos;ll use soap at best for washing hands a day , and sometimes once a week .
What &apos;s the result of that ?
Children take diseases where they &apos;re supposed to love and protect them , at home .
Think about where you learned to wash your hands soap .
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s hard to change the habits you earn early on .
However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local behavioral rules are the thing that shapes how we change our behavior , and here &apos;s where the private sector comes .
Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 or so will buy this piece to protect her family .
Many women in India will tell them that they learn everything about health habits , disease , from the soap that holds a brand of Live Buy .
The famous brands like this have responsibility to do well in places where they sell their products .
From this belief , in addition to the large-scale of Lynthal , it allows us to continue talking about the washing of hands with soap and health habits with these mothers .
Big companies and brands can change and replace those social behaviors and make a difference in these aging habits .
Think about that : marketers spend all their time making us shift from one brand to another .
And in fact , they know how to turn science and facts into convincing messages .
Imagine for just a minute , when they put all their energy behind a strong message like the washing of hands with soap .
The profit will turn into health outcomes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the FBI brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England actually to fight cholera .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the Minister of Health , and if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s an outbreak in Ghana at that moment .
After a hundred and 18 years , the solution is exactly the same : make sure that they have a way to get this soap piece , and they use it , because this is the number one way to actually stop the spread of cholera .
I think that profit motivation is powerful beyond borders , sometimes stronger than charity , or government .
Government does what they can , especially in terms of epidemics , for example cholera , Ebola at this moment , but with competing priorities .
The budget isn &apos;t always there .
And when you think about this , you think about what &apos;s required to make the washing of hands usually everyday , this needs continuous funding to improve this behavior .
In short , those who fight for public health actually depend on soap companies to continue encouraging the hands of soap .
We have friends like American assistance , the partnership of the public and the global sector to wash hands with soap , London &apos;s school for healthcare and for tropical habits , because , Waterhead , they all believe in a win-win partnership .
The public sector , because we help them reach their goals .
A profit for the private sector , because we build new generations for the future of washing hands .
More importantly , the comfort of those who are more susceptible to disease .
On October 15 , we &apos;re going to celebrate the global day of washing hands .
School , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , that day even our competitors , we all share to celebrate the most important means of public health in the world .
What it takes , and again , where the private sector can make a huge difference , comes out of the creative thinking that drives the invitation .
If you take our campaign and help a child reach age five , we create movies that give a message that washes hands with the right person in a way that might be related to it .
We had over 30 million views .
Most of these discussions are still happening online .
I urge you to take five minutes and see those films .
I &apos;m from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was about social justice .
I trained in the European school for public health .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Ninety-nine years ago , I decided , with the successful public health profession , that I could make the biggest impact before , sell and promote the best inventions of the world in public health : soap .
Today we run the world &apos;s largest hand washing program in any measure of public health .
We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have ambition to reach a billion by 2020 .
Over the past four years , entrepreneurs have grown digitally , whereas child mortality has said in all places where soap use has increased .
It may be uncomfortable to hear — business growth and protecting lives in some way or other equal in the same sentence — but business growth is what allowed us to continue performance more .
Without it , without talking about it , we can &apos;t make the change we want .
Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers who did the same thing : baby death .
I &apos;m a mother , and I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
This is from Myanmar .
It has the most beautiful smile . The smile , I think , that gives you life when you have a second chance .
Her son , Mo , is her second son .
She has a two-week old daughter , and we know that most of the kids who actually died in the first month of their lives , and we know that if we give a soap for every nursing baby , that if we use soap before we touch babies , we can reduce and make change in terms of these numbers .
And that inspired me , inspired me to continue this mission , to know that I can do it with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : feed her children .
And when you think about the next time in a new mother &apos;s gift and family , don &apos;t think long : buy her soap .
It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
I hope you will join us and make hand washing part of your daily life and our daily lives and help more children like Mo to get to age five .
Thank you .

These are simple things : hours , keys , activity , glasses .
These are the things that the Iraqi bombing victims took in Bosnia with them to their last ideals .
We all know these normal things , that we use every day .
Some victims had taken personal things like toothpaste and toothbrush completely showed that they had no idea what was going to happen to them .
They &apos;re often told that they &apos;re going to be replaced with war prisoners .
These things were retrieved from a group of genocide across my country , and in the meantime , legal medicine structures are beating in a collective grave that was recently discovered , 20 years later on the war .
And it &apos;s probably the biggest one that &apos;s ever been discovered .
Over the four years of conflict that destroyed the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , there were about 30,000 citizens , most of them civilians , who were lost , or thought they were killed , and 100,000 others were actually killed during the war process .
Most of them were killed either in the early days of war or at the end of hostile work , when the U.N. Secretary of the United Nations were killed like Sryntha in the hands of the Arab army .
The International Crime Court issued a number of judgments about crimes against humanity and ethnic harassment .
ethnic aspiration is a deliberate destruction and organized for a political or religious or ethnic group .
It &apos;s as much about ethnic prejudice as killing .
It &apos;s also about destroying their property and their cultural inheritance , and ultimately destroying the deep idea that they were originally born .
It &apos;s not just about killing , it &apos;s about identity .
There are always clues — there &apos;s no perfect crime .
There are always remains of people who consume that remain more harmful than their fragile bodies and our selective memory than they are .
These things were restored from many genocide grades , and the main goal of collecting these things is a unique process to recognize who was disappearing in murder operations , the first ethnic exhaustion on European soil since the Holocaust .
None of these bodies should remain unexplored or unknownst .
Once they &apos;re restored , they &apos;re cleaned up and analyzed these things that victims carry on their way to executing very carefully , and they &apos;re perceived and stored .
Thousands of crafted in plastic bags like you see in the CSI series .
These things are used as a tool for forensic medicine to visually identify the identity of victims , but they &apos;re also used as valuable legal evidence for criminal crime courts .
The survivors are sometimes called to try to figure out these things personally , but the personal browser is extremely disturbed , and it &apos;s a painful and unverbal process .
Once legal doctors and doctors and lawyers of these things end up , they become a sense of narrative .
Many are thrown out , believe first , or simply put on the shelf far from sight and from minds .
I decided a few years ago to photograph everything extract in order to create visual archive so that survivors could easily browse it .
Karow for the story , I want to give the beautiful answer to the community .
I want to move beyond the level of consciousness .
In this case , one can recognize these things , or at least these images will remain as a permanent male , unbiased and accurate for what &apos;s going on .
Photography is about empathy , and the philosophy that these things give will ensure that empathy .
In this case , I &apos;m barely a tool , a legal doctor , a paper for you , and the result is that photography is closer to trustworthiness .
Once all the missing people are recognized , the dead bodies are alone in the hall and these normal things will remain .
Simply , these things are the last testimony to recognize the identity of the victims , is the last reminder of that those who have already lived .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And that can &apos;t be true .
I &apos;m a chocolate cake .
So I &apos;d like to show you some of what I was working on .
There are many things I learned from doing 30 days &apos; challenges .
That was part of the challenge that I took a picture every day for a month .
I never had that adventure .
It was bad .
It actually has a lot of fun .
( Applause )
Hi . So today I &apos;d like to share with you some projects underway .
Since we &apos;re still evolving to make these projects real , we &apos;re still working enormously in the world of intuition and mystery .
So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiments that we &apos;re looking at in every project of projects .
So the first project is called Empire Hords .
The tower enters the room and it almost doesn &apos;t have any idea , and it &apos;s paying attention to these paintings with a suspended structure on the wall .
Within a second , as if the paintings had noticed the existence of the excitement , it seemed to slip and grab in a discipline .
( Laughter ) So this is a drawing of both cases .
One is a mess . The other one is a complete order .
And we were interested in seeing the simplicity of change that it takes to shift from state to state .
This also reminds us of two very different conceptual traditions .
One of them is the altar boards in the 15th century , and the second tradition is about 100 years old , abstract Malevik composition .
So I &apos;m going to take you to watch a video .
To give you an idea of scale , the altitude of the biggest painting is about two meters .
That &apos;s about that altitude . And the smallest one is the size of A4 .
So the branch goes into the space , and quickly the paintings wait .
And after a while , if the excitement continues to be in space with space , the paintings will become kind of prevented for the excellence of the excitement and become individual again , so that you feel in the room or the environment , where you &apos;ll notice it quickly .
( Laughter ) So here it looks like the excellence is who makes sense of the order in the paintings , but it might be the other way , that the paintings are stuck in their written behaviors so that they &apos;re imposing on the vocabulary as the operator .
So this brings me to a much more quieter and smaller project called mobile phones by hand .
The matrix sees a piece of paper that &apos;s installed on the far end of the wall , but when you get closer , you see it &apos;s a blank sheet the size of an A4 , or a piece of paper the size of a paper , handheld by two small hand that seem to be sculpted in detail and careful elements of a small cube of wood .
The extrovert also sees that this whole sculpture moves slightly , and it &apos;s like these hands trying to carry a leaf with a big hole for a long time , and somehow you can &apos;t do it .
So this animation is very similar to the degraded nature of the images that we see through the hand-held cameras .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two intersection .
One is through a static camera and one through a handheld camera .
And you &apos;re immediately seeing how the vibrant nature of video indicates there are scenes and personal views .
We just removed the camera and moved that motion to the painting .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
But for us , we &apos;re sort of trying to get the feeling of a shy lighting , like there &apos;s a little guy with a hand-blown hand behind this enormous piece of paper .
That &apos;s sort of the amount of pressure produced by a vacuum service and offering this piece of paper very accurately in front of the matrix .
The other project is taste .
This is a cartoonist model , so the purpose is almost as high .
It has a broken body , two arms , an antenna like the head , very long , and the only goal is to attract attention to itself .
So when an excellent passes , it kind of tends from one side to the other , and moves his arm in a more visceral audience with the approval of the person .
So this is the first test .
You see that the two movements are intertwined , and the purpose seems to share its whole body in terms of this on its head .
But the idea is that when he gets his attention , he loses attention , and he starts looking for the next person to attract his attention .
( Laughter ) So this is the ultimate &quot; &quot; taste &quot; &quot; part .
It looks like it was made out of large amounts like it had come out of a factory like electrical and washing machines .
Because we &apos;re always working out of a very personal space , we love how the object of this financial consumer is removing the character character from purpose , and it gives us a little bit of space about it , at least .
And so for us this is a kind of evil species that tries to buy your attention about the things that you really need , but it might be a character that needs a lot of help .
The next project is purpose , which is also a kind of acoustic machinery .
In the form of a cockpit that is the size of the audience as it looks like somebody on the stage .
So where I am , every single one of you looks this big , and the audience kind of takes all my vision domain .
In this audience , 96 little figures .
They &apos;re mechanically able to clap with their own will .
Which means that each one of them can decide whether and when you want to clap , how much clapping , how you want to influence what it is or how you want to affect others , and if you want to share innovation .
So when we stand in front of the audience , there will be a reaction .
It may be a few filters or a hot ( Applause ) , and nothing will happen next until the players leave the stage , and again the audience will respond .
The reaction may be from a few very weak filters of individuals in the audience , or may be a very noisy cheetah .
So for us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as something for itself or in which it was a private neighborhood that also has a kind of musical property , a music machine .
The musician can play on it by sparking sound patterns or musical patterns that are very complex and different , but it can &apos;t excite the audience to do any kind of reaction .
So there &apos;s a sense of governance and mood and stress about it .
It has a property that sits and creepy .
So here you see that we &apos;re very excited about the head image that divides into the hands .
So here &apos;s a simple visual illustration , like the sides of the brain are interacting with each other to give a sense of binary and intense .
And here &apos;s a prototype .
We can &apos;t wait until we surround 96 of them .
Well , this is the last project . It &apos;s called the Airport Department .
The idea of a window .
This is a real window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made of three thickens of wood pieces .
So we used the same window vocabulary to create our framework or our hanging network in the room that you can see from both sides .
The network is held by a tribe of small forms .
It &apos;s also made out of three different sizes , like it suggests a kind of perspective or view in a single dimension .
Each of these forms can also run back and forth in the path and hide behind two trajectories .
So in contrast to this court network , we wanted to give these very commonplace and systemic storms , like the puppet engine had taken and actually moved them on the track .
So we love the idea of moving these shapes along the path as though they &apos;re wild and bright and happy and happy and satisfying , until you feel kind of disturbing and you &apos;re going to hide behind the fastest wall .
So for us , this work also represents the paradox within it .
These forms are kind of tangible in this very powerful network , which is a prison , but it &apos;s also a castle , because it allows the forms to be a forest and naive and exhilarating and very abundant about the outside world .
So all these real characteristics that I &apos;m talking about are translated into a very specific technical form , and we were very lucky to collaborate with the University of ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
And you see that they &apos;ve extracted the motor lessons from our paintings and made a melody that integrates the printing head movement with moving forward and back .
They &apos;re really tiny .
You can see it expanding in the palm of my hand .
So imagine our enthusiasm when we saw it actually work in the studio , and here it is .
( Laughter ) Thank you .

When I was in college , I was a government worker , which means I had to write a lot of cards .
Now when any normal student writes a paper that looks like a table of his work like this .
You see — ( Laughter ) Working at the beginning is slow , but you &apos;re done in the first week enough to get you to see the heavy days coming out to be productive and nice ... ( Laughter )
And I hope I do this in the same way .
That &apos;s how the plan is .
I &apos;m going to start writing the schedule for the project , and then it &apos;s time to write , and I end up like this .
( Laughter ) And this happens in every paper I write .
Until I was asked to write my graduate thesis from 90 pages , a paper that we &apos;re supposed to work on all year .
And for a paper like this , my normal work schedule was not an option .
Because the project was huge .
I started planning for the project , and I decided that the table had to look like something like this .
That &apos;s how the year goes .
I &apos;m going to start with the easy and light work , and then I &apos;m going to get a little bit more effort in the middle of the year , and at the end of the year I &apos;m going to do my best — it &apos;s going to be very easy as climbing the ladder , a degree .
How hard could the staircase be ?
Not so big , right ?
But something happened to me .
In the first few months .
She came and went fast , and I couldn &apos;t do anything .
So I decided to change my plan a little bit .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) But actually , the middle of the year went up very quickly , and I didn &apos;t write one word . So I &apos;m here !
You take the two months for one month and then two weeks .
And one day I woke up , and there were only three days on the delivery , and I didn &apos;t write any word yet , so I did the only thing I could do , I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours , and I continued two full days without sleep , and humans shouldn &apos;t sleep for two days without sleep , ran out to college , slow motion , I handed the paper on the date .
I thought I &apos;d done everything .
A week later , I got a call , it was a call from college .
They said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tim Orben ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; We must discuss with you about your thesis . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the best thesis we &apos;ve ever seen in our lives .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This didn &apos;t actually happen , actually . ( Laughter )
It was bad thesis beyond borders . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought , &quot; &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was so bad .
Anyway , today I am a writer and an online actor .
I write in a blog called &quot; Wait , but why ? &quot;
Two years ago , I decided to talk about marketing and recording .
My behavior has always been around me and why I do my work , and I wanted to explain to those and to the world , what &apos;s going on in the heads of people who are writing and questioning their work , and why are we so .
I had a theory that said that the brains of the scanners were really different from other people .
And to test this , I found a laboratory that allowed me to use the MRI machine to photograph my brain and the brain of another man who doesn &apos;t register his work to be able to compare them .
And I brought pictures with me to see it today for you .
Now I want you to take a closer look to see if there &apos;s a difference .
I know you &apos;re not all experts , and it &apos;s not clear , but just look , OK ?
So here &apos;s a picture of a brain that doesn &apos;t hurt .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s a picture of my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both brains contain the &quot; &quot; decision-making , &quot; &quot; but the machine brain also contains the &quot; &quot; immediate pleasure .
Now , what does this mean for the future ?
I mean , everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
Man : &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the perfect time to do work . &quot; &quot; The monkey : &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; So the logic decision is going to do something useful and productive , but the monkey doesn &apos;t like the plan , the wheel monkey takes the wheel and says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we read an entire Wikipedia page about Nancy and Tonya ? &quot; &quot; Because I just remember this happened .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll go to the refrigerator and see if anything changes in it 10 minutes .
Next , we &apos;re going to enter the YouTube cycle that starts with videos about Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends up very long after watching Mom Justin Bieber interviews .
( Laughter ) The monkey : &quot; &quot; All of this is going to take time , and there &apos;s no space to do anything today .
&quot; Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here !
This monkey doesn &apos;t look like somebody you want behind the edge .
He lives entirely in the moment .
He doesn &apos;t have a memory of the past , and I don &apos;t know about the future , he just cares about two things : &quot; Simple and fun . &quot;
In the animal world , this is going on ideally .
If you &apos;re a dog , and you don &apos;t do anything but easy and fun , you &apos;re successful at all scales .
( Laughter ) And for monkeys , humans are just another species of animals .
They eat , they sleep and they reproduce , which is going to be natural in primitive times .
But , if you don &apos;t notice , we &apos;re not in those times .
We &apos;re in a time of evolution and civilization and monkey doesn &apos;t know what that means .
And that &apos;s why in our head , we have the capabilities that no other animal can do .
We can imagine the future .
We can see the whole picture .
And we can do long-term plans .
The decision maker takes all of this into account .
And we just want to do what seems right and logical to do now .
And sometimes something makes sense and fun at the same time , like having dinner or going to sleep , or enjoying time in space .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a lot of fun .
Sometimes they agree .
And at other times , it makes more sense to work in something that &apos;s difficult and unpleasant for the great benefit .
And here &apos;s where conflict happens .
And for the author , this exhibition always ends the same way , which makes it spend most of its time in the orange region , an area that is fun and easy and totally separate from the logic circle .
I call it the Dark Garden .
( Laughter ) Now , ( Dark Garden ) A place you all know , the dragonflies are good .
A place where space activity happens at a time is not really a vacuum time .
The fun that you have in the Dark Garden is not real , because it &apos;s not absolutely right and the air around you is filled with guilt , reflection , anxiety and self-hate all the beautiful drawings .
And the question is , when the monkey is behind the wheel is : How do the same encyclopedia transmit to the blue area , a region where there are less pleasant and easy things , but it &apos;s much more important .
Well , it turns out that what he &apos;s doing is he has a guard owner , somebody who &apos;s always watching and looking at him in the darkest , and I have a moment — a guy named Punk .
( Laughter ) Now , &quot; &quot; Punk Monster &quot; &quot; sleeps most of the time — but he woke up all of a sudden , when any very deadline is approaching or there &apos;s a risk of embarrassment in front of people or loss of function , or any frightening disorder .
And most importantly , it &apos;s the only thing that scares the monkey .
Now , this monster has become connected to my life for the last time , because TED officials contacted me six months ago and let me talk about it .
( Laughter ) Of course I said , yes , my dream was always .
I talk at TED last year .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And in the middle of all this sensation , the decision maker was thinking about something else .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear about what we agreed to ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen someday in the future ?
We have to sit down and shake the speech right now . &quot; &quot; The monkey said , &quot; &quot; I agree with you , but what do you think we open Google Maps , and we zoom in on the bottom of India and we explore it for two and a half hours to get up to India , to educate ourselves about this country . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
Six months into four and then two to one month , the TED Conference decided to announce the speakers at the conference .
And when I opened the site , I found my face staring at me .
And guess who I woke up ?
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Punk beast &quot; &quot; started to lose his mind — and in a few seconds , the system turned into chaos . ( Laughter )
And the monkey — remember , the monkey feared out of the bald monster — went up to the tree .
And finally , the logic decision was able to take the cost and I was able to start the lecture .
Now , &quot; &quot; Punk &quot; &quot; represents all sorts of crazy behaviors at the scanners , like how I could spend two weeks of all kinds of behaviors on writing one sentence in my thesis , and then in a sense , words come in continuously in two days to write eight pages .
This whole case with three characters , this is the machine system .
Not nice , but at the end , it works .
And that &apos;s what I decided to write on the blog a couple of years ago .
And when I wrote , I was welcomed .
Thousands of messages got me , from all sorts of people , from all over the world , working all kinds of jobs .
They were nurses , bankers , criminals , engineers and lots of Ph.D. students .
( Laughter ) And they all said , &quot; I have the same problem . &quot;
What struck me was the paradox between the light of speech I wrote and the cost of these messages .
These people were very frustrated about what the marketing did in their lives , about what this monkey did to them .
And when I thought about it , I thought to myself , if the marketing system works , what happens ?
Why are these people so frustrated ?
It turns out there are two types of marketing .
Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , all examples , all have an end date .
And when there are final materials , the effect of the Bible is contained and compressed in the short term , because the beast intervenes .
But there &apos;s another kind of recording , a kind of thing that happens in conditions that have no final date .
For example , if you want to start a work literally , something in art , or a mathematician — these works have no end date at the beginning , because nothing happened originally , whereas if you go out and start working hard to earn some activity to do other things .
There &apos;s also a lot of important work out of your work , and it doesn &apos;t include endless dates — like visiting your family or sports and caring about your health , working to develop your relationships , or bad relationships .
Now , if the only way to end these hard things is through the beast , there &apos;s a problem , because in all these important works that don &apos;t have the end-of-the-art rays that aren &apos;t going to appear .
There &apos;s no date to wake up for . So , the effect of the Bible is not going to be content , and therefore , these works will continue and expand forever .
And this is the kind of long-term marketing that doesn &apos;t see and doesn &apos;t get much about it like the first type : fun , short-term and content on a final level .
And usually people suffer from the second kind of quietly and especially .
And this recipe may be a big source of grief and long-term regret .
So I thought , this is why these people send me , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in a bad situation like this .
It &apos;s not because they care about a particular project .
It &apos;s because of that long-term generation that has made them like outsiders , sometimes , in their own lives .
Their frustration does not come from not realizing their dreams , but because they couldn &apos;t even pursue them .
So as I read the letters , I sort of came up with an inspiration : I don &apos;t think there &apos;s anyone who doesn &apos;t register their work .
That &apos;s true , I think you &apos;re all encyclopedia .
Of course , you may not be chaotic — like each other . ( Laughter ) And some of you may have a good relationship with the date and the commitment to it , but remember : the secret monkey trick is when there &apos;s no end date .
Now , I want to show you one final thing .
I call this : the schedule of life .
Every square represents a week in 90 years of life .
There doesn &apos;t seem to be a lot of them , especially that we &apos;ve used a lot of them before .
I think we all need to take a deeper look at this table .
And we have to think about what we &apos;re actually asking , because each one of us has something to do with his life .
We have to keep careful of the immediate pleasure monkey .
This is a job for all of us .
And because there &apos;s not a lot of boxes in the table , that &apos;s a job you have to start from today .
Mmm , maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know , you know .
Sometime soon ...
Thank you .
There was a guy named William Sonson , who was summarized by the honor of Congress , repeated his work on September 8 , 2009 .
That day , he was flying out of American and Afghan forces on their way to an area in Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who were going to meet some local villagers .
The flight fell in Kamen , and they were surrounded by three directions , and among many achievements , the leader Sonson was honored to convince him to launch a living fire to save the wounded and get the dead out .
Among the people who rescued them there was a sermon , he and one of his colleagues was trying to get to the gymnosophist .
And what was interesting about that day was that by accident , one of the members of the medical intestine staff was wearing a helmet with a Pro camera , and he happened to see the whole scene with this camera .
The President Sonson and his team showed up with this wounded soldier who shot me on his neck .
They put it inside the helicopter , and at that moment you see the leader Sonson , and he leaned to accept him before he turned around to save more soldiers .
I saw this , and I wondered , where do people like this come from ?
What was this ? Deep emotions , very deep , make you want to do this .
There was love , and I wanted to know why I don &apos;t have colleagues like this ?
You know , in the military , they give birth to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves , to win others .
In business , we give a grant to people who are willing to sacrifice others to let us win .
We deal with things in the way , right ?
So I wondered , where do people like this come from ?
My first conclusion was that they were better people .
People who are privileged to this concept of service .
But that explanation is completely wrong .
What I &apos;ve learned is that it &apos;s about the ocean , if you have a proper environment , each of us will be able to do special things , and the most important thing is that everybody can do this as well .
I had the great privilege to have one of those , who we call heroes , who risked themselves and their lives in order to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And their answer was , &quot; Because they were going to do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s that deep sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are very important here .
The shapes about these two concepts are feelings , not commands .
I can &apos;t just tell you &quot; trust me , &quot; &quot; and you do .
I can &apos;t simply commit two people in collaboration , and they do .
Things don &apos;t go that way . They &apos;re emotions .
So where do emotions come from ?
If you go back to the past 50,000 years , to the Stone Age , to the early stages of homo sapiens , what we &apos;ll find is that the world was full of risk , all those forces worked everything they could to kill us .
It &apos;s not personal .
Whether it &apos;s about weather , scarcity of resources , or the tiger tiger , all of those factors have been working to shorten our lives .
So we evolved to become social animals , live and work together , within what I call the safety circle , in the palm of the tribe , where we felt belonged .
And when we felt safe with each other , the natural result was trust and collaboration .
There were benefits .
That means I can sleep at night and I &apos;m sure there &apos;s one of the tribes that &apos;s guaranteed .
If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you &apos;re not going to protect me from risk .
A system of survival is not good .
That &apos;s exactly what we live in today .
The world is full of risk today , things that try to undermine our survival , reduce our chances of success .
They may be the capabilities of the economy , or the scaffolding of the stock market .
It could be the technology that makes your business system end up praying overnight .
Or it might be your competitors that sometimes try to kill you .
Or getting you out of business , or at least , trying hard to get your progress or steal your business idea from you .
We can &apos;t control these forces .
These are real data , and they can &apos;t disappear .
The only variable is the working conditions within institutions , and that &apos;s where leadership seems to be , because the leader is who imposes the workforce .
When a leader chooses to put the safety and the life of people inside the institution first , to sacrifice their comfort and the tangible results so that people can feel secure and belong , then amazing things can happen .
I was on an aerial trip , and I was watching an accident where the passenger was trying to get on the plane before he was calling it , and I saw the responsibility on the gate treating the man as a superlaw driver , as a criminal .
He screamed at his face because he tried to get a group out of time .
And I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why should you treat us as a herd ?
Why can &apos;t you treat us as human ? &quot; &quot; So that was exactly what she said to me .
She said , &quot; &quot; sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I will fall into trouble or I will get fired . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me was that she didn &apos;t feel secure , all she was telling me .
She didn &apos;t trust her leaders .
The reason why we travel on the South Six Lines is not because they necessarily operate the best of the consequences .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their teachers .
See , if conditions are not good , we are forced to spend our time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that impairs our institutions from within .
When we feel secure within our institutions , we naturally gather our talent , our time and work without a solution to face the external risks and take opportunities available .
The nearest analogy I can give to what a good leader might be , is a father .
If you think about what a good father might be , what do you want ? What are the characteristics of a good father ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , raise them and lead them if they spend the time , all in order to grow up and achieve more than we did .
Great leaders want the same thing .
They want to give a chance to their employees , to provide them raising and admire if they do it , to build trust themselves , to give them an opportunity to try and fail , all in order to achieve more than we thought we would achieve ourselves .
Charlie Kim , the CEO of a company called Nicholas Gamp in New York City , which is a technology company , Charlie pointed to an important point when he wondered if you were going through tough conditions with your family , would you ever think you &apos;d never give up one of your kids ?
We would never do this .
So why do we think about the possibility of giving up our employees in institutions ?
Charlie &apos;s law of employment throughout life .
If you work in Nicholas Gabby , you &apos;re not going to be released by problems in your performance .
Instead , if you have problems , they will train you and support you , just like we were going to do with one of our kids when he comes home with a test point .
What happens is the exact opposite .
That &apos;s why a lot of people have that great hate and anger from some of those CEOs of your children due to their salaries and their system is unequal .
It &apos;s not about numbers here .
It &apos;s for them to lose the travel to define leadership .
They &apos;ve chosen this very profound decade in society .
We know that they allowed their employees to sacrifice themselves to protect their interests , but the point is , they sacrifice their employees to protect their own interests .
And that &apos;s what really bothers us , not the numbers .
Are we going to be upset if we give Gandhi 100 million dollars a grant ?
How about 250 million dollars for mother Theresa ?
Will we have anything ? Never .
Great leaders never laughed .
By their employees in order to save their profits .
They were sacrifice their profits to save their employees .
Bob Shaphan , who runs a big factory in the Midwest called Bari-Wemler , who has dramatically influenced economic inflammation in 2008 , and overnight , lost 30 percent of the students .
In a big industrial company , this is a big problem , and it might make them not able to afford their business .
They had to save 10 million dollars , so , as for many companies today , the board of the administration came together to discuss the survey of workers .
But Bob refused .
See , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in the labor hand .
Bob believes in the heart of the workers , and it &apos;s harder than simply to get the heart of a worker .
So they came out with a vacation program .
Every staff from Redwood to the CEO , was asked to take four weeks as a non-paid vacation .
They could take it any time they were created , and they had to not take it on the track .
But it was the way Bob announced this program that made the difference .
He said , it would be better to hurt all of us a little bit more to hurt some of us so much , so the staff &apos;s content went up .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and more importantly , as it was expected , when people felt safe and protected by their managers , the natural reaction was trust and collaboration .
And increasingly unexpected , people started to exchange each other .
Who could afford more was to exchange with those who could afford less .
Some of them would take five weeks for others to just take three weeks .
Leadership is a choice , not a tie .
I know a lot of people at the top of the surveillance in their institutions who are never leaders .
They &apos;re window forces , and we apply what they say because they have power to us , but we couldn &apos;t follow them .
And I know people who are at the base of their institutions don &apos;t have any authority but are real leaders , because they choose to take care of the person on their left , and because they choose to take care of the person on their right .
That &apos;s what a leader means .
I heard a story of some of the marine pedestrians who went to one of the stages , and as often as the Marine Corps were another officer from eating , and made his team eat first , and when they were done , it was not food for him .
And when they came back to the field , his men brought him some of their food to make him eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re the ones who are the front .
We call them leaders because they risk everybody .
We call them leaders because they choose to sacrifice to support their employees safe and protected and to benefit , and when we do this , the natural result is that our team will sacrifice for us .
They would give us their blood , their sweat and their money to see that their leaders saw the light , and when we asked them , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
Why don &apos;t you give your blood and your sweat and blood to that person ? &quot; &quot; Their answer would be one : &quot; Because they were going to do this for me . &quot;
Isn &apos;t that the institution that we all want to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The most complex problems of our time can be solved with simple technologies , if we can dream .
When I was a kid , I discovered that creativity is the key to crossing dreams into reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Roth Teschor , a Jewish refugee I woke up at the heart of the Andes Mountains .
So I grew up : I was encouraged to see beyond the border .
So an educational part includes its help in remote communities , of indigenous people .
I shake those memories , because it helped me understand life beyond the city , a life that is so full of possibilities , without barriers , like language or culture .
During those journeys , my grandmother was receiving a poem like Kepling : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
Go and look beyond the mountains .
Something lost behind the mountains .
You &apos;re missing and waiting . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the next years , I became a medical student .
One in 100 children born all over the world has a kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem that I think I can solve — the part that I &apos;ve spent my life working on .
The problem begins during pregnancy .
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
Living alive depends on communicating between what &apos;s regime and pneumonia .
At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
If it doesn &apos;t close , the child has a hole in the heart .
It &apos;s caused by early birth and genetic disease .
But what we know today is that the lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
As you can see in the graph , the frequency of these kinds of holes is dramatically increasing with the altitude .
Video : ( Child crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they begin to have a physical need for breathing .
To close the hole , the only solution was a major surgery .
So one night , my friend and I , Mimi , were camping in the Amazon .
And the only thing that didn &apos;t burn in the fire was a green opkado branch .
Then came the inspiration moment .
So we used that branch as a mold for our first invention .
It can be used to close those holes in the hearts of children .
The fake is a piece of wire wrapped around itself .
It may not seem very sophisticated to you now , but that was the first successful attempt for us to create a device for this big problem .
In this video , we can see how a very small catheter takes the beetle to the heart .
And then the turtle shut down the hole .
After that moment of inspiration , a very long time of effort came to develop a prototype .
It took free studies in the lab and in the biosphere thousands of hours of work .
The luxury , if you do , can save lives .
I came back from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have a chance to make a difference .
My wife and I , my partner , Dr. Alexandria Heath , we started to see patients .
After treating patients successfully with our taxonomy , we felt very excited .
But we live in a place that &apos;s 12 feet high .
And the patients there needed a special device to tackle their hearts .
Patient puncture has different , because the hole between the arteries is wider .
Most patients can &apos;t treat at the right time , and they were dying .
The first one was able to successfully treat half the patients in Bolivia .
It started looking again .
We went back to the drawing board .
After many experiments , with the help of my grandmother &apos;s friends of indigenous people in the mountains , we got a new device .
For centuries , indigenous people have seen stories through complex patterns of urine , unexpected skill helping us with the new device .
We took this traditional way of knitting and created a smart material that was recorded in the form .
This time , the fabric allows us to create an inexpensively wireless device because it &apos;s made out of just one piece .
It can change by converting itself into very complex structures by doing decades to evolve .
As you can see , the device goes into the body through the natural channels .
All doctors do is close the train through the hole .
Our device expands , it sits and closes the hole .
We have a beautiful delivery system that is very easy to use because it works on its own .
No open surgery .
( Applause ) We as doctors , fight against diseases that take a long time to heal — if that happens .
This is the child we saw before , after the process .
You see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is focused in place , the patient is 100 percent recovered .
From the beginning to the end , the whole procedure only takes 30 minutes .
This is very fragmented from the perspective of medicine and humanity .
We &apos;re very proud that some of our former patients are part of our team , thanks to the documented interaction with the patients that work with us .
Together , we only have one idea : the best solutions have to be simple .
We &apos;ve lost the fear of making something new .
The road is not easy .
Many obstacles emerge all the time .
But we get power from our patients .
Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is injured , because of the cost or availability .
So we have to start a foundation with a personal model .
We &apos;re going to give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
We &apos;re in a lot of countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
This whole thing started with a single impossible idea as it would continue , really : no count of any child .
Thank you very much .

Well , I grew up in Limbaus , on the border between Leopbos and Mumbunga , in a small town called Mottium .
Where water sources and electricity are unpredictable as for weather , and I grew up in these difficult conditions , and at the age of 17 , I was relaxed with my friends in the winter , in a sunbathroom .
The sun in Limbo becomes very hot in the winter .
So while we were in the sun , my best friends next to me and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why not invent something you can put on your skin so that you don &apos;t need to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; I would buy this product if it was there . &quot; &quot; And then I went home , and I did a simple search , and I found some shocking statistics .
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today don &apos;t get appropriately on water and sanitation .
450 million of them are from Africa , and five million of them are from South Africa .
And there are many diseases in an environment like this , and the most dangerous diseases are generosity .
Transgenesis is affects the eye as a result of the traits that go into the eye , repetitive infections of puncture can make you suffer permanently .
This disease affects eight million people with permanent blindness every year . The shocking part of this is that to avoid injury , all you have to do is wash your face : no need for drugs , no grain and no injection .
So after seeing these shocking statistics , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; Well , even if I don &apos;t do this for myself because I don &apos;t want to bathe , at least I have to do to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) With my deadly friend , my mobile phone , 634 — I never had a laptop , and I didn &apos;t get the Internet much , except for the 20 pounds of hour — I did a simple piece of science and I went on the Internet .
It looked like a CSF recipe , you know ?
And I said , well , we have the formula ready now .
We need to start now to implement .
Four years later , after writing a 40-page business plan on the mobile phone , after writing my invention on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent in my country , and — &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t bathe anymore ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) — I can &apos;t say more than that . ( Laughter ) Drake Both invented the dry bathroom — the first replacement in the world .
You can actually put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to bathe .
( Laughter ) So after trying to do it in high school with my limited resources , I went to university , I met a few people , and we started implementing , and we have a fully ready product to launch the market , and it &apos;s already available in the markets .
We learned some lessons in terms of Drey Both marketing and offering it to the market .
One of the lessons we learned is that poor classes don &apos;t buy products in large quantities .
You buy products when you need , someone in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a cigarette , they buy one cigarette every day , even though it &apos;s expensive .
So we filled Drey Both in these little innovative bags .
You just grab it from the middle and compress it to get the product out .
And the cool thing is , Kisa is one alternative to one bathroom for five Rand .
And after creating this model , we also learned a lot about productive action .
We realized that the rich kids in the suburbs also want &quot; &quot; Dream Both . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
However , we realized that we were able to save 80 million liters of water on average every time the bathroom is over , and also provide two hours a day from the time of children living in rural areas , which means two extra hours to school , two extra hours to do the homework , two extra hours to live their childhood .
When we saw this huge impact , we reduced it in our basic proposal value , which was about cleaning and surgery .
Drake Both is a palm for the rich and save lives for the poor .
After the forensic entered the implementation , we actually entered the process of selling the product to a global company to ask in the stock market , and I have a question I would like to ask in the audience today , on the untargeted ways of Libby , and with 50 pounds a week , I brought the world a way of not bathroom .
So what can you bring new ideas ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t completed yet , I haven &apos;t completed yet .
There &apos;s another very important thing that I learned through all this trajectory , last year , Google made me feel like I was one of the most brilliant young minds in the world .
I &apos;m also the best project owner in the world , and the first African to get this puncture , but there &apos;s one thing that connects me a lot , that I did all of this because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .

Five years ago , I was on vacation of scientific research , and I went back to the University of medicine that I studied .
I saw real patients and not white whale for the first time in 17 years , actually since I became an administrative counselor .
There are two things that surprised me during the month I spent there .
The first thing is the common issue of discussions that were about hospital budgets and reducing costs , and the second thing , which really troubled me , is , in fact , the number of colleagues I &apos;ve met , former medical school friends , I &apos;ve known them to be some of the smartest people , most excited and emotional people I &apos;ve never seen before , I &apos;ve found a number of them who have become the same , or they &apos;ve forgotten about the hospital management .
So , with this focus on reducing costs , I asked myself , have we forgotten patients ?
A number of countries where I come from and where I come in conflict with health care costs .
It &apos;s a big part of the national budget .
And a number of different reforms aim to disrupt this growth .
In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients to do surgery .
In other countries , there are new medicines that don &apos;t pay , and so you don &apos;t get to patients .
In some countries , doctors and nurses are the goal , to some extent , to the government .
And after all , the expensive decisions in healthcare are done by doctors and nurses .
You have to choose to make a high-cost laboratory , and you choose to do a process on a patient and an older lady .
So putting a limit to the freedom of doctors , that &apos;s how you control costs .
And ultimately , some doctors today will say that they don &apos;t have the full freedom to make choices that they think are the right for their patients .
So it &apos;s no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
In Buston &apos;s consultant group , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way to manage health care .
And we went back and said , &quot; What &apos;s the thing we &apos;re trying to do ? &quot;
In the end , in the healthcare system , we aim to improve health for patients , and we need to do it at a limited cost or affordable cost .
We call this health care based on value .
On the screen behind me , you see what I mean by the value : the percentage of the patients to the money we spend .
This is a beautiful project in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Tesberg .
In this picture , you see my wife &apos;s father and he has three beautiful daughters of his daughters .
When we started doing our research at Boston Consultants , we decided not to look very much at the cost , but look at the quality instead , and in search , one of the things we couldn &apos;t escape from , which is the difference we saw .
Compare hospitals in a country , and you &apos;ll find some of them are very good , but you &apos;ll find a lot of them pretty much worse .
The differences were enormous .
Eric , my wife &apos;s father , suffered prostate cancer , and maybe he needed to do a procedure .
Right now he lives in Europe , and he can go to Germany in which his reputation system is good .
If you go there and go to an average hospital , it &apos;s going to have a risk of having a petroleum with about 50 percent , so it &apos;s going to have to start dressed up again .
Thankfully by piece of metal money , it &apos;s at risk 50 percent . That &apos;s a lot .
If he instead went to Hamburg , and to a clinic called Martin Cleinck , the risk would be one in 20 .
Whether you choose to strike luck , or you have one in 20 of the risk .
That &apos;s a big difference , seven times a difference .
When we look at a number of hospitals for a number of different diseases , we see these big differences .
But you don &apos;t and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
And it &apos;s probably not there .
Nobody knows .
So going to the hospital is lucky .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There &apos;s hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish bone surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they did when they did a hip operation .
On the left-hand side of this slide , you see a difference in metal pieces , artificial tumors that can be used to someone who needs a new hip .
They all realized their own way of doing the process .
And they all said , &quot; &quot; My way is better , &quot; &quot; but none of them already know , and I &apos;ve come to that .
So they said , &quot; &quot; Maybe we need to measure quality to know and we can learn better . &quot; &quot; So they actually spent two years discussing , &quot; So what &apos;s the quality in the hip surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we have to measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we have to measure that . &quot;
And eventually they agreed .
And when they agreed , they started measuring , and they started sharing information .
Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the patient &apos;s bone before you put the metal column in it , that actually will continue longer , and most patients will never have to do the procedure again throughout their lifetime .
They published the data , and it actually turned into a clinical app in the country .
Everybody saw that this had a big indication .
And since then , they publish every year .
Once a year , they publish the periodic table : who is the best , and who is at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , and therefore a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , the Swedish hip surgeons got the best results in the world , at least for those who were already measuring , and a number they didn &apos;t .
Now I found this principle really interesting .
So doctors come together , they agree what good is , and they start measuring , they share the data , to find who is the best , and learn from it .
Higher improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not just the interesting part .
It &apos;s interesting in itself .
But if we go back to the cost side of the equation and look at that , it turns out that , those who focused on the quality , they actually had less expensive , even though that &apos;s not the goal in the first place .
So if we look at the story of the hip again , there was a study that was done two years ago where they compared American and Swedish .
They looked at how many patients needed to reprocess seven years after the first operation .
In America , it was three times higher than Sweden .
How much unnecessary processes , how much unnecessary suffering are for the patients who have been through these literature for seven years .
Now , you can imagine how much savings would be for society .
We did a study where we took a look at the OECD data .
And the OECD , mostly , looks at the quality of care from which they can get information through organs .
The United States has , for many diseases , really , the lowest quality of the organization .
Now , if the health care system in America is focused more on measuring quality , and it only raises quality to the average level of the organization , it will save the American people 500 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the health care budget of the country .
Now you can say that those numbers are awesome , and all that makes sense , but it &apos;s possible ?
And that would be a real lack of health care , and I would say that it could be done , it should be done .
The change agents are doctors and nurses in the health care system .
Through my practice as a consultant , I probably meet 100 or more than 100 doctors and other workers in a hospital or health care every year .
The only thing they have in general is that they care about what they &apos;re doing in terms of quality for their patients .
Doctors , like most of you in the audience , are far competitive .
They were the best in the classroom .
We were always the best in the class .
And if anybody can show them that the outcome they do for their patients is not better than others do , they will do anything for improvement .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
Doctors have another property .
They actually achieve success by looking at the other .
If a cardiologist invited another cardiologist in a competitive hospital and discussed why that other hospital has much better results , they will share .
They will share information about how to improve .
So , by measuring and transparency , you &apos;ll get the continuous improvement circuit , which this slide shows .
Now , you might say this is a good idea , but it &apos;s not just an idea .
This is what &apos;s actually happening .
We &apos;re the ones that create a global society , and a vast global society , where we &apos;re going to be able to measure and compare what we &apos;re doing .
With two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the founder of Carolina in Sweden , the Popstician Consultant Society created something we call ICS or Mother .
You might think that &apos;s holiday , but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s short .
It &apos;s the International Society of measuring health outcomes .
We collect the top doctors and patients to discuss , one disease , what is really good , what should we measure , to make those standards global .
They &apos;ve worked — they &apos;ve done four work groups over the last year : white eyes , lungs , tapestry disease , which is for example , heart attack , sultate cancer .
Four groups are going to publish their data in November this year .
That &apos;s the first time that we &apos;re going to compare apple to apple , not just within one country , but between countries .
The next year , we plan to do eight diseases , the next year , 16 .
In three years , we plan to cover 40 percent of the disease burden .
Compare the apple to the apple . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that done ?
Five months ago , I was a leader of a workshop in the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , and she said she has a vision : I want to manage my large institutions more well , the results that matter to patients .
This particular day , we sat in a circle alongside doctors and nurses and other staff , and we were discussing blood cancer in children .
The group has discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure better than we do ?
We &apos;ve discussed how we can deal with these kids , what are important improvements ?
And we discussed what the costs for these patients , we could do more effective treatments ?
There was tremendous energy in the room .
And there &apos;s a lot of ideas , a lot of excitement .
At the end of the meeting , the head of management , he was standing .
He looked through the group and said , &quot; &quot; First , raise his hand , forget — raise his hand , meet it , and then the team said , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . And today , we &apos;re finally discussing what the hospital is doing is the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring the value in health care , that &apos;s not just the cost but the results of this issue for patients , and we &apos;re going to make employees in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but a significant part of the solution .
I think measuring the value of health care will revolutionize , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , which always puts the patient in the center that he will smile in his grave .
Thank you .

I &apos;m happy to share with you some amazing results for me about what drives companies to succeed at a higher level , what are the factors that affect corporate success ?
I think emergent companies are one of the greatest ways to make the world a better place .
If you bring together some people and give them fair incentives and you organize them in an emergent company , human energies will launch in a way that was never possible before .
You can push them to achieve amazing results .
But if the organizing of the emerging company is perfect , why does a lot of it fail ?
That &apos;s what I wanted to know .
I wanted to know what &apos;s the most important factor here for the success of emerging companies .
And I wanted to be systematic about that , to avoid any precedent or misperception I have from watching a lot of companies over the last few years .
I wanted to know that , because I started doing business since I was 12 years old , when I was selling candy at middle school parties , and I made solar devices at high school to university where I made audio speakers .
And when I graduated from college , I started programming companies .
Twenty years ago , Idealab started , and in the last 20 years we started doing more than 100 companies . A lot of them worked , and a lot of them really missed .
And we learned so many of these failures .
And I tried to demonstrate the factors that caused success and failure in these companies .
So I looked at these five factors .
First , the idea .
I thought the idea was everything .
I called my own company Ivy Banker for the very moment that she came up with the idea for the first time .
But over time I &apos;ve come to my thinking that maybe the team , the execution and the ability to adapt these things is more important than the idea itself .
I would never have imagined that I would have witnessed the quote of Mike Tason on the TED stage , but he said one day : &quot; Everyone has a plan , so he can get a check on his face . &quot; &quot; And I think that &apos;s true and true for business as well .
A large part of the team &apos;s action depends on its ability to adapt to receive a bite in the face of a client .
The customer is the real reality .
And so I got to think that maybe the team is the most important factor .
Then I started studying the business model .
Does the company have a clear way of producing customers &apos; revenue ?
And that began to propose to the top in my mind about what are the key factors for success .
And then I looked at the dead .
Sometimes companies receive enormous amounts of funding .
Maybe that &apos;s the most important factor ?
And of course there &apos;s time .
Did the idea come before it was contracted and the world not ready for it ?
Is it early , so that you &apos;re in the front and you have to define the world with it ?
Is it perfect ?
Or is it late , and there are already many competitors ?
So I tried to study to master these five factors in many companies .
And I looked at the 100 ideas labs , and another hundred other companies aren &apos;t pursuing corporate labs to try to figure out a scientific idea about this .
First of all , in ideas labs , the best five companies : CitySarch , Carta Direct , to NetZero , Ticchs.com , all of these made billions of dollars .
And the five at the bottom Z.com , the Insider Pages , MyCorps , Deskettop Fact.y , Peoplen inck , our hopes were very high for it , but it didn &apos;t work .
So I tried to describe through all the traits how I felt about corporate performance in these factors .
And for companies that are uncomfortable with ideas , I looked at the successful , like Airbnb , Uber , LinkedIn .
And some failures : Webvan , Kozo , Pets.com , Flood and faint endendends.com.
Companies down there had intensive funding , and they even had business models in some cases , but they didn &apos;t .
And I &apos;ve tried to find the factors that have influenced success or spending all these companies , and the results really surprised me .
The first actor was time .
The timing turns out 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
The team and implementation came at the second time , and after they got the idea , the variation of the idea , characterized the idea , that came at the third time .
It &apos;s not quite crucial , that doesn &apos;t mean that the idea isn &apos;t important , but what really surprised me was that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important factor .
Sometimes the most important was the right time .
Last two , the business model and finance , they made sense to me .
In my opinion , it makes sense to be a business model in a religious orbit because you could start a project without a business model and add it later if a customer asked what you invented .
And for finance , I think also , if you &apos;re having a little bit of funding at first , but you get a very attractive power , and especially in our current time , it &apos;s very easy to get intensive funding .
Let me give you some examples of each of them .
Let &apos;s take Airbnb as an example of a success that everybody knows .
Well , that company I knew was going through a lot of smart investors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to rent a place inside their house for a stranger . &quot;
Of course , people have proven that this belief is wrong .
But one of the reasons that this project worked alongside the good business model , and the good idea , and the excellent implementation , is time .
That company came out at the top of the Economic Forum when people were in the most need for extra money , and maybe helped them overcome their refusal to rent their own home to a stranger .
Same with Uber .
Uber came out , an amazing business model , an amazing business model , also great .
But the time was really perfect because they needed drivers in their organization .
And the drivers were looking for extra money , which was very important .
Some early successes , Citysec , came out when people needed web pages .
ToToTo.com , who was announced at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking at effective ways in terms of cost to get traffic .
We thought the idea was great , but in fact , timing was more important .
This is also after our failures .
We started a company called Z.com , and it was an online entertainment company .
And we were so excited that we collected enough money , we had a great business model , and even we had an agreement with a wonderful talent from Holywwwoodpod to join the company .
But the hacking on the broadband was very low in 1999 to 2000 .
It was very difficult to see the content on the Internet , you had to go into your browser and do all these things , and eventually the company broke in 2003 .
Two years later , when the problem of encryption was solved by Adobe Fash , and when they hacked the broadband , 50 percent of Americans were perfect time .
Great idea , but it &apos;s an incredible time .
In fact , I didn &apos;t have a working model when I started at the beginning .
It certainly wasn &apos;t going to work .
But it was really , really fascinating .
So what I &apos;m saying in essence , implementation is really important .
The idea is very important , too .
But timing is more important .
And the best way to get to the right time , is to look carefully , if consumers are really ready for what they offer them .
And you &apos;re not really honest about this , you don &apos;t deny any outcome you see , because if you have something you like , and you want to push it forward , you really have to be honest with the timing factor .
As I said earlier , I think emerging companies can change the world and make it a better place .
I hope that some of these insights may help you get a higher success rate , and so you create something wonderful to come to the world , which would never happen otherwise .
Thank you very much . You were an amazing audience .

I was good at school . The expectations for my generation were high , and Babbage entered medical life from lectures and concerts and robbering racial signs .
But inside , I was actually very easy , very unconfident , and really scared — scared of others , from the future and from the space that I felt inside me .
I was leaving a call when it started , and I was advocating for myself , feeling my suitcase just like I was doing hundreds of times before , and suddenly I heard a quiet voice saying , &quot; She &apos;s leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one , but the clarity and the envelope of this comment was unworthy .
&quot; It opens the door . &quot;
That was the beginning , the sound arrived .
And the sound continued , days and then sold without a narrative disconnect all I did in the gut .
&quot; It &apos;s going to a lecture . &quot;
It was neutral , free of emotion , even after a while , I became exhausted and reassuringly reassuring , even though I noticed his outer calm retreating sometimes and that sometimes reflects my hidden emotions .
For example , if I was angry , I had to hide it , and I often was very good at hide what I really feel , then the sound seems frustrating .
A precise adaptation process started : The altruism that natural people don &apos;t hear those sounds and the fact that I hear them is that I really have a very serious problem .
I spent some time talking to the doctor of college .
And to be fair , I needed an interesting and help , and I started telling him about the weird sound .
For example , I was part of a student TV station that was broadcasting news all over the campus , and at a very late date , I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , Dr. , I should go .
And at this point , the events started to sing me very quickly .
That followed entering the hospital , which is the first thing of many things , the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the character came up financially , and then , the worst of all , there was a toxic feeling of hopelessness and hopelessness , the tail and the kind of creepy towards myself and hopelessness .
But after encouraging me to acquire sound not as an experience , but as a disease , my fear and resilience grew .
Basically , this was like taking a hostile position to my mind , sort of a psychiatric war , and that in turn caused the number of voices and gradually growing hostile and threatened .
Do you see that water cup ?
In fact , a vicious cycle of fear , escape , mistrust and misunderstanding was formed and it was a battle where I felt helpless and unable to create any kind of peace or reconciliation .
After two years , it was a dramatic devastation .
Until now , I have suffered from all the symptoms of the fever : horrible sounds , ugly insights , strange and difficult illusions .
Now looking back at the wreck and despair in those years , it seems to me now that someone had died in that place , but someone else had been rescued .
A broken and wounded person started that journey , but the person who came out was successful and will eventually grow to be the person I represent now .
Many people have hurt me in my life , and I remember them all , but memories grow young and faithful compared to the people who helped me .
And I think Eleanor can skip that .
Sometimes , you know , the snow falls late in Iran , but the summer always comes . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to thank those who were generous and good people who fought with me and who woke up to welcome me from that tortured and isolated place .
At first , it was very hard to believe that at least because the sounds were very hostile and threatened , so in this case , the first step came out that I learned to separate the metaphor from what I described before as the real truth .
For example , the sounds that I threatened to attack my house have learned to explain as my sense of fear and lack of security in the world , rather than being real danger .
Now at first , I believed them .
I remember , for example , staying on a night in my father &apos;s room to protect them from what I thought was a real threat of voices .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
I have a plastic shack , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; A strategy plan .
It was fun with this knowledge , and eventually I was going to collect myself , every part of me represents a different voice , gradually pull out of all my treatments , and come back to the psychiatrist , but this time from the other side .
Now I &apos;m very proud to be part of my own organization of International votes , an initiative inspired by Professor Marius Romi and Dr. Sandra Ischer who identifies my hearing of sounds as a psychological response to crazy circumstances , not as common as schizophrenic symptoms of schizophrenia , should be carried , but to a large , meaningful and exploring experience .
This kind of society is not only possible that it &apos;s already on the way .
&quot; Once social change begins , it cannot be reflected . &quot;
You can &apos;t humiliate the person who feels proud .
You can &apos;t confront the people who aren &apos;t afraid anymore .
In the last 20 years , a sound movement has created hearing networks in 26 countries across the five continents , working together to promote dignity and solidarity and to empower individuals from psychiatric disorders to create new language and practices of hope that are concentrated in the souls of faith that are not distributed in the power of the individual .
As Peter Levin said , a human animal is an individual species of its kind with its unique ability to heal and intellectual spirit to harness these fungal abilities .
In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege of delivering that process of healing for someone , to witness and to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and the disability of hope in their winners .
We &apos;re unique . We can &apos;t sing .
What lies inside of us can never be really colony , filled , or taken away .
Light doesn &apos;t turn off .
As a very good doctor said to me one day , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people should say about yourself .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I came here to share with you my pictures .
Is it really pictures ?
Certainly a picture like this can &apos;t be taken with a camera .
My interest in photography started when I got a digital camera at the age of 15 .
And he mixed up with my early son on drawing , but he was a little different , so when you use the camera , planning is basically the foundation .
And when you take a picture of the camera , it ends up pressing the button .
So for me , photography was much more dependent on being in the right place at the right time .
And I felt that anybody could do that .
So I wanted to figure out what &apos;s different when you start the process when you press the button .
A picture like this : Building is on a crowded road .
But it has an unexpected definition .
And yet , it maintains a level of reality .
Or images like this are dark and colorful , but one goal is to preserve a level of reality .
When I say real , I mean the reality of the picture .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually pick up , but I always want it to look like it was taken as a picture .
Photography lets you think for a moment to discover the trick .
It &apos;s about picking up more idea than picking up a real moment .
But what is the trick that makes it look real ?
Does that have to do with detail or color ?
Or lighting ?
What creates a illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world and how it can happen on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not just about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is real .
So I think the foundation is very simple .
I just see it as a mystery of reality where you can bring different pieces of reality together to create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three physical things that we can all imagine , and we can all connect them to the three-dimensional world .
But it &apos;s merged in a certain way to shape what it looks like 3D as possible to exist .
But at the same time we know it &apos;s impossible .
So we create our minds because they don &apos;t accept the fact that that shape doesn &apos;t make sense .
And I see the same process in installing images .
It &apos;s about combining more than reality .
So what makes a picture that looks real is the things that we don &apos;t think of as things that are around us in our daily lives .
But when we collect images , we have to think about them , or they don &apos;t seem to be somehow incompatible .
I &apos;d like to say that there are three simple rules to get to a real result .
You can see , these are not unique images .
But when we combine them , we create something like this .
So the first rule is that complex images should bring together the same perspective .
Secondly , composite images have to have the same kind of light .
The two roots with these two pictures were taken from the same altitude and under the same light .
The third rule is a state of discrimination , the limit that begins with different images and ends up making safety .
So it &apos;s impossible to figure out how the image was installed .
So by matching color , variation and lighting across the border between different images , and adding photographic effects like the depth of the unseen color and noise , we surround the boundaries between different images and making them look like one image , even though the one image could essentially have hundreds of layers .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) Some of you may think it &apos;s just a picture of a landscape , and the bottom part is just what &apos;s been treated .
But this picture is actually completely composed of images from different places .
I personally think creating a place that is easier than finding a place , because then you &apos;re not going to go to solving the middle of ideas in your head .
But it takes a lot of planning .
And as soon as I had this idea in the winter , I realized that I had several months to plan to find different places to collect puzzle pieces .
For example , the fish was filmed on a fishing trip .
And the beaches are from different places .
The bottom of the water is taken from a stone hole .
And I turned the house up the island to the red to make it tend to the Swedish character .
Having a real outcome , then you can summarize it in planning .
It always starts with a diagram , with an idea .
And then you collect different images .
And this is a blueprint for every piece accurately .
And if you can take pictures successfully , you get very beautiful , very real results as well .
All the tools are around us , and they &apos;re not restricted to our imagination .
Thank you .

We saw in April 3 , 2016 the largest data leap in history . The Panama Papers revealed the rich and powerful people to hide enormous amounts of money on outdoors . What does that mean ? We borrowed Robert Bowler from the Louis to explain this issue , this week , there was a tremendous , powerful group of stories that came out of a leap of 11 million bloggers from the Mosta Office .
These leaves leak out of Panama , a very small part about the secret of a world transmitting companies out of the recording country .
We got a steady look at how customers and banks and lawyers go to lawyers like Mosques Vonica and say , &quot; &quot; Well , we want an anonymous company , can we give us one ? &quot; &quot; You now have to see email , and you can look at text messaging , and you can understand how this works , how it &apos;s run .
Now , I &apos;ve already started the immediate implications of this issue .
The Prime Minister of Iceland arrested .
We also have news that a Syrian monster dictator of the Syrian Association also has companies and funds outside .
And there &apos;s a 2-billion-dollar restaurant coming back to the Russian Vladimir Putin by a friend of his intimate childhood , who became the best Sheilo sponsor .
And there will be a lot of rich and other people who will be concerned about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
Now this looks like a plot of an interesting spy movie or a John Grishmm novel .
This seems so far from you and me and about ordinary people .
So why should we care about that ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful people are able to keep their money out and not pay for the taxes that they have to pay , which means that there are less money for public services that are necessary like health care and education and roads .
And this affects all of us .
So far for my organization , Mountain Witness , these leaks have become extraordinary and extraordinary .
We have the media and political leaders in the world who talk about how individuals use offshore carpet to hide and store their property — we &apos;ve been talking about this thing and disseminated it a decade ago .
Now , I think a lot of people find this whole world confusing and confusing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this kind of money and companies work outside the register country .
I like to think about it a little bit like a Russian blood .
You can get a company overlapping in another company , interfering with another company , which makes it impossible to really understand its nature and who stands behind it .
It &apos;s very difficult to implement law or tax authorities , journalists and civil society to understand what &apos;s going on .
I also think what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s a little coverage about this issue in the United States .
And this may come back to some of the most remarkable Americans have not yet been revealed in these leaks , and in this hypothesis .
And that &apos;s not because there are no American wealthy out there who have hidden their property by transporting them out .
But because of the way money and companies are transferred outside the country , Mosques Venica has a few American customers .
I think if we see the leaks from the Kayman Islands on the Caribbean , or even from the states of Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you can see many instances and examples that come back to America .
In fact , in a number of United States , you need less information , you need less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
This kind of secret in America allowed employees from local areas to run schools to deception and give school students .
And it allowed the trickster to recruit the poor poor investors .
This kind of behavior affects all of us .
Now , in Mount Witness , we wanted to see how this really works in practical terms .
And how does this work ?
So what we did was we sent a secret check to 13 legal companies in Manhattan .
It turns out that he &apos;s a African minister and he wants to transport faint money to the United States to buy a house and hide and fly .
And what was really shocking was that all the lawyers , except one of them , we made suggestions about how to transfer these fake money .
And all of these meetings were informal , and none of these lawyers were treated as a client , and of course no commercial deal was contracted to move money , but it really shows the problem in this system .
And it &apos;s also important not just to think about this as a singular case .
It &apos;s not just one lawyer who talked to our secret investigation and made suggestions .
The political issue is not just a cold political issue , it was arrested by a flash .
But it &apos;s about how this system works , which harnesses corruption , escapes taxes , poverty and instability .
And in order to address that , we need to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
This may sound like a disappointment and inevitably , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has changed , like there &apos;s always rich and powerful individuals .
But with my optimistic nature , I see we &apos;re starting to get some change .
Over the last two years , we &apos;ve seen a real push for more transparency when it comes to owning a company .
This case was put on a political schedule by the British Prime Minister — David Cameron at the top of the eight industrialized countries that held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
Since then , the European Union brings to the bias of central records at the national level about who owns and really dominates companies across Europe .
One of the sad things is that the United States is still really behind .
And legislation was introduced by the Republican and Democratic Party in the House and the Senate , but it wasn &apos;t the big progress that we wanted to see .
So we really want to see the Panama leaks , this big misconception of the property system outside the recording country , being used as an independence in the United States and around the world .
For us in Mountain Witness , this is a moment for change .
We need ordinary people to be angry about the way people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; This is not a good secret to work and to work . &quot;
We need to recognize and recognize political leaders this problem , and commitment to changing the law to reveal this kind of secret .
We can put together a secrecy that now allows us to escape taxes , corruption and prosperity to wash money .
Chris Anderson : Hello Julian .
We &apos;ve been told that WikiLex Encyclopedia , from your accomplishment — in recent years , a lot of secret pages published more than every newspaper and the news channels of the world together .
Do we think that &apos;s true ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , could it be real ?
It &apos;s worried — right ? — that all the media channels in the world are not making good news , and a small group of activists are able to publish more than that kind of information than the rest of the news channels in the world combined .
CA : How does that work ?
How do people send you these documents ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
Julian : This is — as I can say — a certain kind of people who turn the glasses into some problems , and we have a number of ways of working with them that we can collect information for us .
We can say it &apos;s the art of the secret code to send things online , to hide the dance features , pass it into legal directions like Sweden and Belgium to interact with and provide legal protection .
We get information through the mail , the normal mail , whether it &apos;s encrypted or not , we accomplish it like any normal news institution , covering it — which is sometimes very difficult to do , when you talk about a huge information system — publish it to the public and then we defend ourselves against legal and political attacks that are inevitable .
CA : So you &apos;re doing effort to make sure that the documents are legal , but in fact you don &apos;t know almost who this source of information is .
Julian : That &apos;s exactly how , yeah . Very rarely we know , and if we know at some point , then we destroy that information once we know it .
( Ringing ) Damn it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the Central American intelligence is asking what the code of TED is . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take an example , real .
This is something you did a few years ago .
If we could get this page out ...
This story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what I did and how that happened ?
Julian : This is the Carroll report .
This was a secret report of the intelligence that was commissioned by the Kenyan government after the election of 2004 .
Back in 2004 , Kenya was controlled by Daniel Ross for 18 years .
It was a fairly fair dictator .
And when Kiki came to power — through a group of forces , she was trying to fight corruption in Kenya — they issued this report , in about two million pounds of pounds on this and the accompanied report .
And the government kept it and used it for political pressure on May , which was the richest man — and still the richest guy — in Kenya .
It &apos;s the sacred glass of the Kenyan press .
So I went there in 2007 , and we drove to wait for that because of the election — the national elections , December 28 .
When we published that report , we did it three days later for the new president , Kiki , who decided to believe with the late man on his platform , Daniel Raby May , and then this report had become an old problem about President Kiki &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , to wrap up a long story — the contents of the report leaked into Kenya , not through the legal news channels , but in an indirect way , and in your opinion , it really impacted the election .
Julian : Yeah . That became the headline for the Guardian newspaper , &quot; &quot; English . &quot; &quot; And then all the countries around Kenya were born in her newspaper , in the press of Tanzania and South Africa .
And so he came inside through the outside newspapers .
And then , almost two days later , the Kenyan press felt something safe to talk about the report .
And for 20 days in Kenyan television , not voting 10 percent , depending on Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the outcome of the election .
CA : So , your clinical encyclopedia generally changed the world ?
Julian : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : Here — we &apos;re going to see a little bit of video of a drone hitting Baghdad .
Video is long . But this is a short drop .
This is — this is a harsh film , I &apos;d rather warn you .
Radio — oh , once you put it in your eyes , fire .
I see your goals , yes , I see four vehicles , over my vision ...
They &apos;re in a cattle . They &apos;re old . They &apos;re beaten .
Tell me when they &apos;re in your grip . Let &apos;s fire .
I make them all in Mac .
Come on , hit !
( Fire sound ) It continued . ( Shoot sound ) It continued .
Oil ... Buckminster Thomas , Buckminster Thomas , ( Cryptography )
We have to move . It &apos;s time !
All right , we &apos;ve just joined all eight individuals .
We see two drones , we &apos;re still shooting .
Half . I managed it .
T-X-ray , this is Tu XX , we &apos;re moving very easily .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What happens ?
Damn it . Come on , ha ha ha . I got it .
CA : What was the effect of that ?
Julian : The effect of that on people who worked on the video was painful suffering .
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to study the dimensions of this story .
This seems to be just the first attack of three attacks that happened in this scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 men died in this attack , right , including two employees of the Rutgers agency ?
Julian : Yeah . Two Ritters , two young children were running .
They were all 18 to 26 people all killed together .
CA : And that has explored a lot of anger in many places .
What was the main reason for this that actually caused anger , through your personal opinion ?
Julian : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see the excessive variation of using power .
You see in the video a group of men running quiet down the street , and you see Helvester Abachi hidden in one of the corners shooting at 30 kilometers away from each other — looking for any justifier to do that — killing people who rescue the wounded .
And there were two journalists in the place that had no rebels because this was their job .
CA : I mean , there was this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Maning , arrested , and he was complained that he had a confession in a cyberchat room that he had leaked this video , besides 280,000 secret pages of U.S. embassy programs .
I mean , did he really do that ?
Julian : We &apos;ve benefited to receive those condoms .
It was convicted , about five days ago , by the mission of getting 150,000 rides and leaking 50 of them .
Now , we published at the beginning of this last year from the American Embassy in Reckjavick , but that &apos;s not necessarily related to the situation .
I mean , I was a visitor known for that embassy .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve already received thousands of U.S. embassy leave ...
Julian : We had posted them . ( CA : You were going to do that ? ) Julian : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) Julian : Well , because this kind of stuff shows what the reality of the situation is , say , Arab governments , the actual violations of human rights in those governments .
If you look at the information that &apos;s out there , that &apos;s the kind of media that &apos;s there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk more clearly and more public about this .
I mean , generally , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it true that you encourage to leak secret information ?
Julian : Well , there &apos;s a question about what kind of information is important to the world , what kind of information can be achieved .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So the information that organizations are doing is an economic effort to hide , is really a good signal when information is announced , there &apos;s some hope that it does something good , because institutions that know better , that know that information from the inside , are doing a real effort to hide it .
And that &apos;s what we found through experience . This is the editor of the history of journalism .
CA : Isn &apos;t there a kind of risk with that , whether for individuals who are interested or actually for society as a whole , where leaks can actually cause unplanned outcomes ?
Julian : We haven &apos;t seen anything from that in all we &apos;ve been talking about .
I mean , we have a strict immunity policy against any damage .
We have a way of dealing with information that has the character character character — personal character information that specializes individuals .
But there are secrets that are allowed to — you know , your medical record with your doctor . This is a secret and a law team , but we &apos;re dealing with people who are looking at some of the problems that have really good motivation .
CA : I understand that they have a motivation .
And what you would say , for example , you know , somebody &apos;s father — who serves his son in the American army , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve put something that has a sensitivity where somebody else has a preceding incentive to publish this thing into public .
It shows American soldiers laughing at people &apos;s death .
That gives impression — it has given the impression of millions of people around the world that American soldiers are not at the human level .
In fact , they &apos;re not . Dad says , &quot; &quot; My son is not . How do you dare ? &quot; &quot; What do you say as a response to that ?
Julian : Yeah , we &apos;re giving a lot of that .
But remember , people in Baghdad , people in Baghdad , people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see this video : they see it every day .
It &apos;s not going to change anything in their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception of something .
This is what they see every day .
It &apos;s going to change my opinion and perceive people who fund all that , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : There &apos;s a way to highlight what you see in this kind of devastating secrets in companies and government .
Light is good .
But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order to capture that light , you have to personally , create a kind of privacy or secret around your own destiny ?
Julian : Not exactly . I mean , there are no opposition to WikiLex yet .
We don &apos;t have any opposition sources to other sources .
Are they supposed to say that , it &apos;s going to be a embarrassing situation for us , but we assume that we &apos;re going through a way that people feel that they &apos;re morally motivated to continue our mission , not to go back .
CA : I &apos;m going to be impressive , in fact , depending on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m looking to see people from the TED audience .
You know , there could be two visions of WikiLex and Julian Encyclopedia .
You know , hero — hero for all people — that brings them this important light .
Another example : a serious cause of problems .
Who sees it hero ?
Who sees the cause of trouble ?
Julian : Oh , sure . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s not a big crowd , Julian .
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that has never been revealed , but for the first time it &apos;s revealed .
I mean , it &apos;s an interesting story that happened recently , right .
What is it ?
Julian : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year — in November last year — there was a series of explosions in Albania like the one that happened in the Gulf of Mexico , but it &apos;s not as big as that in the Gulf of Mexico .
And we received a report — sort of the engineering analysis of what &apos;s going on — they say that , in fact , what happened , a security guard of some of the competing oil companies actually had , convenient tangles that they exploded .
And part of the Greek government had income , in that , and so on ...
And the engineers &apos; report has nothing to do with it , so it was a very difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t make sure how healthy it was because we didn &apos;t know who it was writing and what was going on .
So we were so suspicious that maybe Paul was a competition that was manipulating or causing a problem .
In the shadow of these circumstances , we put it aside and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The written material looks good , it sounds right , but we can &apos;t make sure of it . &quot; &quot; And then we gave the speech this week from the company I wrote , you want to track the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; We want to track the source . &quot; &quot; And we were then wondering , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
Any document , what are you talking about ?
Can you prove to us that you have a legitimate trait in this document ?
Is it really for you ? So they sent us this shot of the screen with the author on a number of Microsoft editors .
Yes .
( Applause ) But it happened a lot , though .
This is one of our ways of identifying — to make sure that the health of the informed material , is to try to make this group write to us speeches .
CA : Yeah . Do you have information from inside BP ?
Julian : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at this moment , we &apos;re going through special circumstances that are kind of a series of donations and engineering efforts .
So the rate that we published over the last few months has declined a little while we &apos;ve been reengineering our internal system to meet the demand for the superpublic opinion we &apos;ve met .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any kind of growth that &apos;s happening to an emerging organization , we &apos;re in a situation that we didn &apos;t expect to succeed , and that means we &apos;re giving an enormous number of documents that people prescribe on very high capacity , but we actually don &apos;t have enough people to make sure that information and advertise it .
CA : So that &apos;s a real bottle problem , basically volunteer journalists and / or finance of these journalists ?
Julian : Yeah . People are trusted .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s hard to grow fast because of the kind of material that we &apos;re dealing with and we &apos;re offering , so we have to modify the way we work if we want samples who will be dealing with secrets at the top of national security , with fewer security situations .
CA : So help us alone to understand your personality and how it got to work .
And I think I read that when I was a kid , I went to 37 different schools .
Could that be true ?
Julian : Well , my father was working in the movie business and then the dimension of a particular place , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , Dr. myself could say that that &apos;s a way to build Paranoia .
Julian : What , the movie work ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were — I mean , you were a computer hacker when you were little and you caught authorities early .
Julian : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist at the beginning of my age .
I wrote a magazine , and it caused me some problems when I was a teenager .
So it has to be very careful with computer hacking .
I mean , like — there &apos;s a way that can be used or organized for many things .
Unfortunately , now , it &apos;s often used by Russian mafia to steal your grandmother &apos;s account in the bank .
This &quot; &quot; hamster &quot; &quot; is not — as cute as it was in the past .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing the grandma of anybody , but what about the essence of your faith in principles ?
Could it give us an idea of these values and maybe some situations in your life that had an impact on those values ?
Julian : I don &apos;t remember any of the situations .
But the basic values : well , older men who have special abilities don &apos;t cause to produce victims : they take care of victims .
And this is something from my father and something else from men who were able to have an impact in my life .
CA : Well , generous men who have special abilities don &apos;t cause to produce victims : they take care of victims .
Julian : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a fan of struggle , so I &apos;m not a little bit big on the side of care , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to care for victims , which is to track those crimes .
And that &apos;s something that was in my personality for a long time .
CA : Tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : What happened in Iceland ?
I published something in the press there , caused a problem with a bank , and then the press Council there was something to prevent the spread of that story or the news .
Instead of spreading your story .
That made you a famous person in Iceland . What happened next ?
Julian : That &apos;s a big story , you know .
Iceland went through this economic profession .
It was the toughest and most cruel crisis that any country in the world had ever gone .
Their financial sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy as a whole .
Anyway , we published this report in July last year .
The National TV was casually apologized five minutes before the beginning of the air broadcast . As in the movies , the judicial warning came to the news room , and the news reader was like , &quot; This never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well , let &apos;s show you our website instead , all the time of publication , as an alternative , and we became very famous in Iceland , I went to Iceland and and talked about this problem .
And there was a sense in society that this must happen again , and as a result , working with some politicians in Iceland and and some international law experts , we put a new kind of legislation in Iceland to become the security owner of the free press , with the strongest press protection laws in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for the freedom of journalism and expression .
Iceland is a dynamic country , it &apos;s like Norway , it can interfere in the system .
About a month ago , it was passed by a consensus .
CA : Oh .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
When you think about the future , do you think it &apos;s going to be more like dominance and governing the Big Brother more secret , or are we going to see a bigger brother or that play is going to be in both directions ?
Julian : I &apos;m not sure what way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s a huge pressure of the freedom of expression in journalism and transparency legislation around the world — inside the European Union , between China and the United States .
Which way is it going to be ? It &apos;s hard to know .
That &apos;s why this time is so exciting to be there , because a little bit of effort we can change in any direction or direction we want .
CA : Well , I seem to reflect the audience &apos;s opinion to say , be careful , Julian , and wish you all to applaud .
Julian : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel very lucky to be coming from a country that is , in general , the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland did a strike .
They didn &apos;t do their work that day , whether it was career or house work .
Do a walk to the center of Reykjavík — 90 percent of women participated — peacefully , including the Taliban of equality .
That day , nothing worked in Iceland , because when women were absent from work , nothing worked .
( Applause ) Five years later , Icelandians had the courage to become the first country in the world that elected a woman &apos;s democracy to take the president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , when President Vegas , we knew her first name , going out to her hometown porch , a single mother standing next to her daughter after she died .
( Applause ) This woman was a great role for me and everyone who grew up at that time , including boys .
It was often the story of the boy I accepted after having spent two decades in the presidential and asked her , &quot; &quot; Is it really possible that the kids could grow up to become presidents ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The tools have a huge impact , but even with these powerful models that I feel grateful for . When I encouraged to enter the presidential election , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; I am for a presidency ?
Who am I to become a president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out women are less likely to be displaced than men .
A study in the United States in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men thought about filter for office , while only 45 percent of women thought about it .
That &apos;s a 16 percent difference , which is the same difference from a decade ago .
And it &apos;s really shame , because I believe very strongly that the world needs women of leadership and leadership based on principles more generally .
My decision to run was ultimately because I felt that I had to contribute to my role , even if I had no political experience , go ahead and try to be part of the formation of the world that would be understandable and sustainable for our children , a world where we really allow our children and our daughters to become what they wanted to be .
This was my life &apos;s journey .
It was fantastic .
The journey started 20 candidates .
And then there were nine qualified candidates , and the race ended up with four of us , three men and I .
( Applause ) But the drama hasn &apos;t finished yet .
You think you have a drama in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can assure you that we have our drama in Iceland .
Our boss of governance 20 years ago announced that he would never run for president , and that &apos;s often made a lot of candidates think about running for president .
And then he reversed his opinion after the prime minister resigned the impact of the Panama Papers in which he and his family were involved .
And there was a famous phenomenon in Iceland , and the president then thought they needed a reliable leader .
A few days later , he found relationships with his wife and private companies in the Panama Papers , and he went out of the race again .
And before he did that , he said he was withdrawn because now there are two qualified men who feel they can get his solution in the presidential election .
On May 9th , 45 days before the election day , things didn &apos;t look good for me .
I didn &apos;t even show the chart in the newspaper .
She got one percent in opinion polls , but that was the highest percentage of any woman she had announced .
So it would be like an abuse if I said I had to do a hard job to get a seat at the table and I could get to television , because TV networks decided they were going to add only one percent and more in opinion polls in the first TV debate .
I found out afternoon on on the first day of the TV debate that I was going to share with three men , and I found in the live TV broadcast that I had reached 2.5 percent in the first debate days .
( Applause ) So , the challenges .
The fundamental challenges that I had to face and overcome this journey had to do with media and power and money .
Let &apos;s start with media .
There are people who say that gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I can &apos;t say I &apos;m OK .
It was really hard to get to the media and get a time to broadcast the neighborhood .
As a matter of fact , the progressive candidate appeared in radio media 87 times in the previous months of the election , while I had 31 times appeared .
And I &apos;m not saying that media does this .
I think this bias happens often unconsciously , because in the media , as in many domains , we have popular and non-sense bias , and we need to have the courage to talk about if we want to change it .
When I finally managed to show up on TV , the first question he came to me was , &quot; &quot; Do you want to withdraw ? &quot; &quot; And that was a tough question .
But of course , with one percent to 2.5 percent in opinion polls , that might be understandable .
But the media is really important , and every time it appeared on TV , we saw a rise in opinion polls , I know directly how important it is and why we should talk about it .
I was the only one of the four final candidates that had never had a conversation on the first page .
I was sometimes excluded from questions that were heading for other candidates and enrolled from electoral coverage .
So I had this already , but I would say it to the Icelandic Media Lab .
I had very few comments about my hair and my suit .
( Applause ) And I say , &quot; &quot; Well done .
But there &apos;s another very important experiment .
I grew up as an independent candidate , I didn &apos;t belong to any political party and I didn &apos;t have any strength .
Unexpertise and lack of access to resources may cost us a lot in our campaign , but it allows us to create and work with politics differently .
We were leading a positive election campaign , and maybe for others we had changed the way we did this .
Maybe that &apos;s why I didn &apos;t appear on TV enough because I wanted to be respected to the rest of the competitors .
When it turns out that access to media is something that is so difficult , we created our own media .
I was conducting sessions on Facebook where I got questions about anything from voters and answer them immediately .
And we were putting all the questions and the answers on Facebook open because we see transparency is important if you want to build trust .
And when the access to young voters was a huge challenge , it was used for the SAT .
I took young people to teach me how to use it , and I used every filter that was in the Chuck Senate in the last part of the campaign .
And I really had to use a lot of humor and joke with being very bad in them .
But our youth followers have increased with that .
So we can do a different electoral campaign .
But unfortunately , you can &apos;t talk about politics without talking about money .
I feel sad about it , but it &apos;s true , and we have less financial resources than other candidates .
Maybe that was a little bit because I found it hard to ask for financial support .
And maybe I had the ambition to do a lot with a little bit .
Some people might say this is a very feminine part of me .
But even though only a third of the media documented financial resources , and a organizational team , but it &apos;s amazing , we were able to surprise everyone on the night of the election , when the first numbers came .
And I struck myself as you can see in the picture .
( Laughter ) In the early numbers , I came along with the advanced candidate .
( Cheers ) Well , that &apos;s early because I didn &apos;t stay like this , but I got the second tip , and we passed the one percent in a big difference , about a third of the sounds , and we outperformed opinion polls with an unprecedented margin , by increasing 10 percent of the last poll poll .
Some people say I &apos;m the real winner of elections because of that , and a lot of people encourage me to get elections again .
But what really makes me feel proud is I know that I &apos;ve gotten a proportion to a higher percentage of young people , and a lot of people have encouraged my daughter to have an election in 2040 .
( Applause ) It &apos;s 13 , and it &apos;s never been on television .
And on the election day I saw it on TV more than once , and it was clever and confident than it was , and it was honest and supportive to her mother .
Maybe that was the most wonderful thing in my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was something else .
These are girls at pre-school walking down the street , and they find a poster on it in the parking lot , and where they need to accept it .
Audience : Incredible !
This picture was like winning for me .
What we see , we can achieve it .
Let &apos;s overcome fears and challenges .
( Applause ) It &apos;s important to honor women , and it &apos;s time to mimic the right women , whether it &apos;s the CEO or the head of the state .
And I also succeeded in leaving a impression that I have in your health , THE NESE , YORKER , I got a new quote called &quot; &quot; The living expressive icon of honesty . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) So it might be more proud of it so far , because often women are punished to use what I call emotional pyramid capital , but I knew by the experience that we were just getting good .
( Applause ) And we want more .
We celebrated on election night as if we won , because that &apos;s what we felt .
So you don &apos;t have to get there .
You just have to try to get to it , you and your family and your friends and everyone who works with you , and if you do that on the face , you get to the horizons that you &apos;ve never met before .
We spent a lot of time , and I learned a lot of this journey , many lessons maybe more than share with you in time that I have today .
But make sure it was a hard job .
I deprived a lot of sleep all those months .
It requires not to withdraw a lot of resilience and perseverance , but I learned something that I &apos;d known before in one percent , which is that you &apos;re only good when you hear honestly and listen to your voice and work according to that .
And sometimes you say goodbye to me , you can trigger your intuition , but your intuition can &apos;t invite you .
And I also think it &apos;s very important , and you all know this , that any journey you go through , depends on the utility team for you .
There are people next to you who share the same values and vision , but they &apos;re different in anything else .
This is the equation of success for me , and I &apos;m fortunate to have a wonderful husband , who &apos;s with us today , an amazing family — ( Applause ) and wonderful friends , and we &apos;ve worked with each other on the political square , and we &apos;ve harvested something that everybody has said is impossible .
In fact , the PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would get seven percent at best .
I respected his vision because maybe he was right , and it was based on valuable experience .
But on one percent day , her day decided to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s very important to remember this , because I was denied to sleep a lot , and I worked hard , me and with me .
We can &apos;t keep going if we forgot to take care of ourselves .
And there are two things that have to do that I think are very important , to surround yourself with people and practices that make you thrive , but equally important , even more important , to have the courage to get rid of the people and practices that absorb your energy , including wonderful bloggers and adolescents .
I got a huge support from others to do that , and I made a decision to rise when others sing me , and that &apos;s sort of what made me able to maintain my energy all this time .
And when I was losing my energy for a moment — and this was happening from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I was going back to the idea of why I decided to run , and how I decided to run my race .
I was calling it the 4G campaign , the GG letters represent Icelandic words .
And the first word is Gagan . I promoted to do what &apos;s good , to provide a service , and I wanted the service leadership to be at the center of my work style and who works with me in the campaign .
The second word is Gleii or pleasure .
I decided to enjoy the journey .
There was so much we could take out of the journey whether we could get to the right direction or not .
And I tried to maximize others to do this as well .
The third word is Gagns. I was willing to get any question .
I didn &apos;t keep any secret , and everything was available on Facebook and websites .
Because I think if you &apos;re choosing your boss , you &apos;re worth getting answers to your questions .
And last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we filed under the concept of the girl .
( Cheers ) I &apos;m so happy to have the courage to run , to the dangers of failure but to get success at multiple levels .
I can &apos;t say it was easy , but I can say , and I think my whole team would agree with me , it was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
PM : I haven &apos;t allowed you to go yet . Ha Tomorrow : What a wonderful assembly . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying .
That maybe everyone in this room is willing to go to Iceland and and vote for your favor .
But of course we can &apos;t vote there , but there &apos;s one thing that we can take from Iceland and all the time we &apos;ve taken is inspiration .
I mean , I was as old as I remember in 1975 when all Iceland women were exposed , and this was actually a big job to guide women &apos;s movement .
I had reminded me that at first , and I &apos;d like to take the picture back and just remember what the state looks like when you &apos;re in complete stop .
And what you probably don &apos;t know is because our American media didn &apos;t move it , the Icelandic women did the last Monday , right ?
Can you tell us about it ?
HA : Yeah , after 41 years of original strike , maybe we are the best place in the world to be women , but we haven &apos;t finished our work yet .
So at 2 : 38 p.m. on Monday , the Icelandic women left the work , because this day was their brutal day of being married .
( Applause ) The really cool thing about that is to share young men and females with more numbers than ever before , because it &apos;s time to close the gap between men and women .
PM : I &apos;m not going to ask you for a moment to comment about what you &apos;re going to do next , but I &apos;m going to say you &apos;re going to have a huge army of volunteers if you want to do it again .
Thank you so much .
HA : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve been thinking about my career since I left the White House , and I got a great example , a cartoon in New York magazine two years ago .
And the boy was looking at a lovely father and saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I grow up , I want to be the president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In fact , it was a big benefit for me to work premature because I &apos;ve been able to reach a lot of places that only a few people in this world have had and recognize a lot of people in this big world .
And I don &apos;t just know about 50 states in America , but I did with my wife visit over 145 countries in this world , and I had programs in over 80 countries around the world .
And often when we were visiting a country , we were not only visiting presidents and kings , but we were meeting with villagers living in the remote areas of Africa .
So our commitment to the center of Carter in general was to promote human rights and to know the world as it should be , and I can tell you transparently that the worst violation in the world of human rights is the violation of women and girls and the stranger is that there is no way to do that much .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ll start with a couple of reasons for this .
First , misunderstood the sacred religious texts such as the Bible , the old and the new era and the Koran , and these misinterpretations were made by men controlled by slaves , churches and mosques .
And they interpret these instructions so that they would make women in a normal high school place compared to men through a religious view .
This is a serious problem that has not been adapted enough .
A few years ago , in the year 2000 , I had been a career advocate for 70 years in the Southern Hebrew , and I would like to teach you that I still learn every single day , and I will teach the next one too , but the Southern Hebrew Convention decided in 2000 , that women should play secondary roles with men .
And they issued a decision , which prevents women from being a priest in the church or even in the army , and if women are taught in a classroom there at a church education center , education does not have to be found if there &apos;s a boy in the classroom , because you find a nation in the Bible around that . There are more than 3,000 Airs about that in the Bible , saying women don &apos;t have the education of men and so on .
But the fundamental problem is to misunderstand the religious texts , to keep men in a higher place .
And this is a really big problem , because men can use the power of that , and if a man or a businessman wants to cheat women , say , if a woman doesn &apos;t have to tolerate the man in God , why do we treat it like that ?
Why do we pay women the same pay for the same work ?
And the most dangerous thing here that causes this problem is to rise to violence increasingly , and it &apos;s getting terribly scary around the world .
In the United States , for example , there was a huge increase in exploiting poor people , especially black and minorities by putting them in jail .
And when I was in Georgia governor , there were one in a thousand Americans in jail .
But today we have 7.3 thousand in prison .
That &apos;s seven times more .
Since I left the White House , we &apos;ve had 800 percent more prisoners than black women .
We also have a country in a few of the world &apos;s capital penalty in this developed country .
And we fall between the most countries in the violation of human rights in all norms in terms of encouraging death penalty .
We &apos;re still in California right now , and I discovered very recently that California spent four billion dollars in sentencing 13 people with death penalty .
If you calculate that , California costs 307 million dollars to implement a single person &apos;s death sentence .
The state of Northern Pruska issued a law to abolish the death penalty this week , because it &apos;s very expensive . ( Applause ) So asylum to violence and abuse the poor and vulnerable is another reason to exploit women .
Let me show you some kind of exploitation that really concerns me , and I &apos;m going to try to shorten that because of the spending of time , you know .
First , female genitals distort or two .
Little is a terrible thing , but it &apos;s not known for women in the United States , but in many countries , in the first phase of the age of girls , they do what &apos;s called a sharp section , connected with a sharp code and uncontacted , they remove the foreign parts of the genitalian members of the girl .
And in a few strange cases , they make a vagina open plan so that the girl can just accept and menstrual menstruation .
And when you get married , they use the same section to open the vagina so that the girl can do sex .
And that &apos;s not rare though it &apos;s against law in most countries .
In Egypt , for example , 91 percent of women today are hired in the same way .
And in some countries there are more than 98 percent of women , they were hijacked before they got puberty .
It &apos;s really sad , what happens to women in those countries .
Another frightening thing is &quot; &quot; murder the honor . &quot; &quot; And here the family has a misunderstanding of religious texts , where nothing in the Koran is adopted by a girl by her family . If that girl is raped or married by a man without her father &apos;s consent and sometimes even having her out of unacceptable clothes .
And this work is done by one of her family members , and her family turns into a murder if that girl brings up what &apos;s called shame to her family .
And there was an analysis done in Egypt by the United Nations a little while ago , showing that 75 percent of these infections of girls were killed by father or mother or brother , but 25 percent of the cases of murder were women .
Another problem in this world , women &apos;s reduction is slavery or human trade by modern season .
He had sold 12.5 million people in Africa as slaves in the 19th century and 18th century of modern age .
Now there are 30 million people living in slavery .
The U.S. State Department was written by Congress by issuing a annual report on this thing , and the U.S. foreign report suggests that 800 thousand people are sold every year across international borders as slaves , and 80 percent of them are women , for sexual slavery .
And in the United States right now , there are 60,000 people living in slavery .
The state of Atlanta and Georgia , where the Carter Center is headquarters , where I teach at the University of Emily , there are 200 to 300 women sold to slavery every month .
That makes it the first place in that country .
Atlanta has the most crowded airport in the world , and a lot of passengers come from the southern hemisphere .
And if the owner wanted to buy a girl with a red skin , that could be a thousand dollars .
And for the girl with the white skin , it costs more than twice , and the prostitution owner in Atlanta today , can make 35,000 dollars in slavery .
The sex trade in my state of Atlanta and Georgia outcomes the entire drug trade in them .
So this is another serious problem , and the fundamental problem is humor , where there is no prostitution home in America that local officials don &apos;t know , local police , police leaders , conservatives and others .
And that leads to the worst problem , is that women are increasingly buying and putting in sexual slavery all over the world .
Sweden has a good direction for that .
About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden changed the law , and women no longer ruled if they were in the case of sexual slavery , but the prostitution and the contractors and the clients of men were the ones who were sentenced , ( Applause ) The percentage of prostitution decreased .
In the United States we have the opposite of that .
Every man is being arrested illegally , there are 25 women being arrested .
Canada , Ireland , and I mentioned Sweden already , France and other countries planning to the Swedish model .
This is another thing that can be done .
We have two great institutions in our country , everybody respects them : the military and the wonderful university system .
In the military , they analyzed how many sexual assault happened .
And the last report I got , I mentioned 26 thousand sexual assault by the military , 6,000 .
Only 300,000 , that &apos;s not much , more than one percent actually control the reason is that the SORA in any institution , for example , a ship or a library in the army or a marine company , a lawyer who has a legal right to decide the court of its enemy , and of course , the last thing they want is that people know that sexual abuse has happened under their trial , they &apos;re not going to court .
So we have to change that law .
One of the four girls entering American universities is having sexual assault before graduation , and this has become very well known now , because of my book relative , and because of other things , 89 universities in America have been convicted under the Ministry of Education Act because the officials at universities don &apos;t care about women , in order to protect them from sexual assault .
And the Ministry of Justice says that more than half of the cases of rape in the campus are doing passengers climbing out of the law outside of the university , if they raped someone they &apos;re going to trial them , but in the campus there &apos;s a bar for the rapist .
And nobody &apos;s going to trial them .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening inside our society .
And another very dangerous thing about exploiting women is a lack of business wages , as you know — ( Applause ) But sometimes there &apos;s a misunderstanding , working full-time , women in the United States get 23 percent less than men .
When I was a president , the difference was 39 percent .
So we made partly progress when I was president . ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) In the last 15 years there was no progress , it was about 23 percent or 24 percent in the last 15 years .
This is what happens .
If I take for example the 500 richest companies , 23 of them have the CEO of a woman , from 500 companies , and I have to teach you that CEOs make less than average than the other presidents .
Well , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in our country .
And another problem in the United States , is that we are the largest country that has wars in the world .
We fought about 25 countries , since World War II .
Sometimes we have soldiers fighting on the ground .
Sometimes you fly over people &apos;s pedestals and take bombs on people .
And sometimes we have drones that attack people and so on .
We fought about 25 countries or more since World War II .
There was a four-year period that I won &apos;t find , we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) We didn &apos;t build a bomb and we didn &apos;t shoot . We didn &apos;t launch one shot .
But for violence , it &apos;s the worst understanding of religious texts . That &apos;s the main reason why women and girls use it .
Another reason , I didn &apos;t mention it , is that men don &apos;t care about it .
( Applause ) That &apos;s the truth .
The average man would say that against feminism , but it was silent and accepted by a good situation , and that &apos;s similar to what I knew in my childhood , when the apartheid system found .
The racial discrimination was a hundred years ago , since 1865 at the end of the civil war between the United States itself , and even the 1960s , when Lyndon Johnson passed a law project for equality in rights .
But during that period there were a lot of white people , who didn &apos;t agree with racial discrimination , but they kept silent , because they had great advantages , better jobs , better access to elimination , better schools and everything else . The same thing is today , because the average man doesn &apos;t care .
Even though they say I &apos;m against feminism , they enjoy high positions .
It &apos;s hard to bring all the men who control the campus , and the majority of men who control the military and the majority of men who control the governments of the world and the majority of men who control the great religions .
So what should we do now ?
I tell you the best thing we can do today is , women in developed countries , like this country and like your countries who have an effect and freedom of expression , they have to hold the stigma on themselves and demand strongly to end discrimination against women and girls all over the world .
The average woman in Egypt couldn &apos;t defend her daughters to prevent them from having tents and other things .
I haven &apos;t come to the details about that .
But I hope that at this conference , to make every woman here , her husband realize , that these cases of exploitation are in the campus and in the military and in the future of work , you have to protect your daughters and grandchildren .
And I have 12 grandchildren and four children and 10 children of my grandchildren , and I usually think about them , and the problem they will face in the future , not just for living in Egypt or a foreign country , getting equal rights , and I hope you join me , and be heroes for children and women around the world , and protect their rights as human beings .
Thank you very much .

What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to dance on your wars &apos; drums .
I &apos;m not going to love my body or my soul for drinking your war .
I &apos;m not going to dance to that strike .
I know that multiplication .
No human .
I know the skin you hit .
He was alive one day , hunted , stolen , extended .
I &apos;m not going to dance on your wars &apos; height .
I &apos;m not going to sing . I &apos;m going to get crushed for you .
I &apos;m not going to hate it for you , and I &apos;m not going to hate you .
I &apos;m not going to kill you .
And of course I &apos;m not going to die for you .
I &apos;m not going to be killing , nor donors .
I &apos;m not going to stand up . I &apos;m not going to dance on the bombsight , because everyone wants to dance .
Everybody can be wrong .
Life is right . It &apos;s not a cumulative , it &apos;s not a rustle .
I &apos;m not going to forget where I came from .
I &apos;m going to make my own thesis .
I &apos;m going to collect my loved ones with my relatives , and we &apos;re going to dance on our nose .
If our blood is going to become a song that we dance to .
I &apos;m not going to let you manipulate me .
I &apos;m not going to admit my name or my voice to you to kill .
I &apos;m going to dance , I &apos;m going to dance , dance , dance , dance .
My heart attacks are much more likely to die .
The drums of your low-volume war are less than the sound of whispering , hey .
How are you the TEDsters ? Let me hear your voice .
( Applause ) Salaam .
Aha , Joshua , the inspirational , the peacebuilder .
I know .
I was so wrong .
Really much .
And I didn &apos;t know what to read to you today .
I mean , I was preparing myself .
But in fact , I was just my clothes . ( Laughter ) I made choices , and I was collecting the ideas that I wanted to ask , and that &apos;s what I wanted to do .
Ten is like this .
It brings you . It targets you .
So I &apos;m going to read you a poem that I just picked right now .
But I need you to sit down for about 10 minutes and get a girl who &apos;s not here .
Get it now with you .
You don &apos;t have to tell us her name . Just remember her .
Is it there now ?
This is &quot; &quot; contradiction . &quot; &quot; All sacred history is answered .
Books that didn &apos;t write , predicted the future , understood the past .
My brain started to see beyond borders and creative human violence .
A product of this ?
Who &apos;s the kid who &apos;s not new today ?
Children &apos;s deaths have increased .
And the most sacred death .
We love women . It &apos;s complicated .
The air bursts every day .
The emails come out , the emails are finished .
Wars , like brown teeth .
They all disappear .
Don &apos;t look at the ghost I carry inside .
I live in circles of light and dark .
Prisons are half the silence .
I see it today . I didn &apos;t be somebody else .
Death , health , violence .
I think today , I &apos;m not as pure as I think .
Before the form , I was a blind storm , and I am here today .
The human being is going down the eyes .
I &apos;m not as narrow as I think .
The girls are buried in the hills . They don &apos;t bother .
Language can &apos;t express me .
I had the experience over and over again .
Everything is everything .
Some women have lost 15 , 20 people from their family members .
Some lost six .
Some have lost their head .
Some are looking at the garbage , some of them are eating .
Some are killed in the head , some are killed by their husbands .
Some leave their clothes .
Some have children .
Some of them make borders .
Some people have lost hope to find love .
Some people don &apos;t find it .
Where does the refugee hearts go ?
How do you break ? You poison how you go to remote places , no one &apos;s missing it .
It &apos;s as if it &apos;s missing .
We love each other and we love each other because we don &apos;t mean anything at the end .
We &apos;re in a spinal cord like a spinal cord .
The human being pushes itself into the abyss .
The cluster bombs are throwing away .
The landfill is growing .
The sadness is spreading .
The crops are full of panopoa .
People harvest bombs that kill them .
They harvest the kids .
They harvest hand sheets . They harvest smoke .
The smoke of truth .
Enter the solutions .
The smoke of slavery .
Redemption smoke .
You breathe .
Don &apos;t be afraid of that smoke .
If you want to be afraid , it &apos;s a bit of a smoke that &apos;s not done yet .
Thank you .

When I was a student here in Oxford in the &apos; 70s , the future of the world was a physicist .
The population explosion was unstoppable .
The global famine was unavoidable .
The cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to be used to shorten our lifespans .
The silver rains were falling on the forest .
The desertification was one mile or two every year .
The oil was on its way to win , and a nuclear winter was going to kill us all .
None of these things happened . ( Laughter ) And in a sudden I didn &apos;t expect , if you look at what happened in my life , the per capita income rate of any normal person all over the world , in the natural conditions , has gone down with inflation , and it &apos;s doubling three times .
Natural life expectancy has risen 30 percent in my life .
Children &apos;s death rate fell two-thirds .
The per capita food production rate goes up to a third .
And all of that happened when the population went up to weakness .
How did we achieve that — whether you think that &apos;s good or not ?
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that became more prosperous with the population growing ?
The unclear space in this graph represents the size of population , and the level of the diagram represents GDP per capita .
I think to answer this question you need to understand how different human elements cooperate with their minds and their ideas can come together over and over again , meet and actually be friends .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas can have sex .
I want you to imagine how we could turn from producing elements like this to producing things like this .
Each of these things is real .
One is a cooperative handle that was half a million years ago made by the first human being .
The other is , of course , the computer mouse .
Each of them have the same size and shape to some extent the hardest description .
I tried to work out which one was bigger , and almost impossible to know .
And that &apos;s because both of them were designed to fit the size of the human hand .
Both of them are technology . In the end , their similarity is not the interesting thing .
It &apos;s something to teach us that both of them were designed to fit the human hand .
The differences between them are what excites me , because the ones on the left are made as a beautiful , unsimilar design for about millions of years — a million years ago and a half million years ago .
The first human has made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
Copyright there were some changes , but the tools have changed slower than the structure of things in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
A phenomenal phenomenon , but it &apos;s real .
Whether that tool on the right is over five years .
There &apos;s another difference as well , which is the tool on the left made out of one material .
The tool on the right is made out of a wonderful combination of different materials , silicon , metal , plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a wonderful combination of different ideas , the idea of plastics , the idea of lasers , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;re working together in this technology .
And this Union , this is a multi-technology , which motivates me a lot , because I think it &apos;s a secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body is the product of a bunch of ideas as well , the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
Talk together .
How does evolution work on more innovation in the United States together ?
Well , it uses sex for reproduction .
In remote groups of touching , if you put two different recipes of different species , one green and red , one must be better than the other .
One is going to be extinct in order to live the other .
But if we could make groups mating , then maybe one of them could inherit all the changes that happened to different relatives .
So what sex does is that individual can depend on genetic innovations for all kinds of groups .
It &apos;s not a single atom of its kind .
What are the same steps that produce the same effect in cultural evolution as the role of sex in biological evolution ?
And I think the answer is exchange , usually exchange something for something else known .
It &apos;s a unique human advantage .
No animal can do it .
You can teach them in the lab simple examples of exchange , and there &apos;s actual support between the animals together , but the exchange for one element of something else has never happened .
As Adam Smith once said , &quot; &quot; Never happened that someone saw a dog doing a fair exchange for another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You could have a culture without exchange .
You can , as it was , just a mental civilization .
The chimpanzees , the big dolphins , these kinds of creatures have their own culture .
They know each other the traditions from parents to small animals .
In this case , chimpanzees &apos; families learn each other how to drop the trees into rocks .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow up , didn &apos;t accumulate , and they didn &apos;t become fusion . And the reason is that there &apos;s no sex , as it was , there &apos;s no exchange for ideas .
chimpanzees have different cultures with different groups .
There &apos;s no exchange for ideas among them .
And why is it causing exchange to increase living ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
And here &apos;s a stone model of this story , although it &apos;s a story of commercial exchange images among countries .
Adam took four hours to make a wheat and three hours to do a plan .
It took one hour to make a two-hour feat to make a cat .
So I winning better than Adam in the work of wheat and plenty .
It doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own statement .
Well it &apos;s not , because if you think about it , if you make a winning winning and Adam made two plans , and then you exchange , each of them would have saved an hour of work .
And the more they do that , the better they are , because the better they do that , the better Adam quality in the business of the plates , and also winning will be better at the work of the surgeon .
So the trade exchange between them is going to increase .
And this is one of the characteristics of commercial exchange , it actually creates a kind of a more specialized development , which in turn creates an increase in trade development and so on .
Each of Adam and win saved an hour of time .
That &apos;s a relax , providing time in the face of your needs .
Ask yourself how long you have to work to have yourself a lightbulb for an hour reading this evening you read a book .
If you had to start from the beginning , let &apos;s go to the countryside .
You find sheep . You kill it . You take fat from it .
You treat it with special processing . You can make a candle , etc .
How long do you have to do that ? Sometimes .
How long do you actually have to work to get an hour of light to read if you win average income in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
In the past 1950 , you had to work for eight seconds of average income to get the lights .
And there are seven and a half seconds of relaxation that you won . Since 1950 , as it was , because that seven and a half seconds you &apos;ve enjoyed doing something else , or you can make another commodity or service .
In 1880 , it costs 15 minutes to win this bullet of average income .
In 1800 , it had to work six hours to earn the equivalent of a candle that could be burned for an hour .
In other words , the average person in the normal income would not have a candle in 1800 .
Back to this picture of the cat and the mouse , and ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who made them and who ? &quot; &quot; The stone duck was made by somebody for themselves .
It was self-sufficiency .
We call this Falcon these days .
But the element on the right is made to me by other people .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Tens ? Hundreds ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
Because we have to consider the person who planted the coffee , who was made for the person who was working in the oil field , who was extrapolating oil , which was going to be made into plastic , and so on .
They were all working for me , to make a computer mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as groups of one species .
In the old days , if you &apos;re rich , there were actually people working for you .
That &apos;s what it means to be rich ; you hire them .
There were a lot of people working for Louis 14th .
They were the ones who held his weird clothes , looking like this . ( Laughter ) And they also danced his ridiculous hair like this , and so on .
He had 498 people who were his dinner every night .
But the contemporary tourist who visites the French minister in France and looks at the picture of Louis 14th , also has 498 people who are the slaves of his night .
They &apos;re in bars , coffee shops , restaurants and stores all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you in an excellent meal that &apos;s probably going to be more quality than the 14th Louis service .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
We &apos;re all able to rely on personalization and exchange to lift the quality of each of us .
Now , you understand the theory of animal work for each other .
Ants are a traditional example : workers working for queens and queens working for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , where it &apos;s only happening in the colony .
There &apos;s no exchange for others across colonies .
And the reason for that is that there &apos;s a production divide to work .
This is to say , they &apos;re specialized for reproduction .
The queen works all the work .
In our species , we don &apos;t like to do that .
The only thing we insist on doing ourselves is reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave the reproduction of the queen .
( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
And how long do we still do that ? What does that mean ?
Well , I think , potentially , the oldest version of that is , I think , the sexual divide of work .
But I don &apos;t have evidence for that .
It just seemed like for the first time we did that was a male and female job .
In all societies today we find hunter-gatherers and universities , there &apos;s a divide of work towards the beliefs between , in total , male and female universities .
Not always that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between male and female bases .
And the beauty of this system is it &apos;s both sides .
Women know , in the case of Hazara here — roots that are inherent to engage men in exchange for meat — they know that all you need is a source of protein to look for some seeds and exchange them with meat .
And they don &apos;t have to go to a horrible fishing and try to kill Wardsburg .
And the guy knows that he doesn &apos;t have to work any dig to get seeds .
All he has to make sure that when a pig is killed , it &apos;s big enough to share it .
So each of these sides is raising another living level during the sexual divide process of work .
When did that happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it could be that Neanderthals didn &apos;t .
They were highly cooperation groups .
They were highly intelligent .
Their brains on average , generally bigger than your brain and brain in this room today .
They were good enough to imagine and innovate . They were burning their dead .
They probably had a special language , because we know that they had FOXP2 of the same kind that we had , which was revealed here in Oxford .
And they seem to have language skills .
They were very clever . I don &apos;t underestimate the Nanderthal groups .
But there &apos;s no evidence of sexual division to work .
There &apos;s no sign of behavior assembly by females .
It seems that females were cooperative poachers with men .
And the other thing is that there &apos;s no evidence of a variation between their groups , because the elements that are in the Neanderthal groups remain , the tools they make , are always made of local materials .
For example , in the wake there &apos;s a place where you can find primitive tools made for these groups .
They &apos;ve always used local substances .
In the same valley , there are modern human elements that have lived for about the same history , 30,000 years ago , and some of those tools from local address , but more — a lot of these tools are made out of the Kareem Bay for a long time .
And when humans started moving things in different places like this , it was evidence that they were replacing their elements between their group .
Trade exchange is over 10 times the size of agriculture .
People forget that . People think about exchange as a modern thing .
The exchange between tribes is happening hundreds of thousands of years ago .
And a recent proof of that shows up at about 80 to 120,000 years in Africa , when you see the blackboard and the sabbath and other things moving large distances in Ethiopia .
You also see the sea floor — as it was discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving inside 125 miles of the Mediterranean Mediterranean .
And this is evidence that people are starting to exchange between groups .
And that will lead us to specialization .
How do you know that that long-distance movement means trade exchange as well as immigration ?
Well , if you look at the recent hunting attacks of the Portugual , who flew to extract stones in a place called the Mississippi mountains , which was a knife mine of the Kuwait tribes .
They packed them with their neighbors with things like a kind of inflatable fish , and the result was that those stone axes ended up in a big part of Australia .
So the long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade exchange and not on immigration .
What happens when you prevent people from trade , from being able to exchange and personalize ?
And the answer is that , not only do you slow down the technological progress movement , you can actually push it back .
Tasmania is an example of South Australia .
When the sea level went up , Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , people living in it , not only have they seen a slow progression of the rest of the people on the main island , they actually saw a decline in all areas .
They lost their ability to make some tools out of bones and hunting tools and dressing tools because about 4,000 people were not enough to keep the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they were using .
It &apos;s as if people in this room were held on a desert island .
How many things in our pockets make us continue to make 10,000 years later ?
It didn &apos;t happen in Terra Fogo — a similar island , and people like that .
The reason is , because Terra Fogo is separated from South America in a very narrow way , Argentina right now , and there was trade across this parallel for 10,000 years .
While people on Tasmania were isolated .
Back again to this picture and ask yourself , not just by making it for , but who knows how to do it .
In the case of the stone duck , the man who made it knew how to make it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
No one , literally no one .
Nobody on the planet knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean , this is seriously .
The head of a computer mouse doesn &apos;t know how .
He just knows how to run a company .
The person who works on the production line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to treat the oil well to get out the oil to make plastic , and so on .
We all know a little , but none of us know everything .
I am , of course , derived from a famous article by Leonard Reed , the economist in the &apos; 50s , the phrase &quot; &quot; I , pencil . &quot; &quot; In what he wrote about how he made pencil , and how no one knew how to make a pen , because the people who work on his creation don &apos;t know how to put it together with carbon , and they don &apos;t know how to cut other trees and those other businesses .
And what we did in the humanitarian community , through trade and personalization , is we created the ability to do things that we didn &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
With language we have to transform the ideas that we understand with each other .
But with technology , we can do things beyond our capabilities .
We &apos;ve been able to extend the capacity of the human mind to a super-glamorous level .
And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons I &apos;m not interested in arguing about measuring intelligence , whether some groups have higher I.Q. than other groups .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant to it .
What &apos;s about society is how people &apos;s ideas communicate together , and how they cooperate well together , and not with the skill of individuals from them .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective mind .
We &apos;re just spots on the network .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s sharing ideas and the way it &apos;s presented , interviews and friendships between ideas , that cause technological progress , over time , something .
Even though bad things happen .
And in the future , as we &apos;re going to move forward , we &apos;re certainly going to experience horrible things .
There will be wars and there will be frustrations , there will be natural disasters .
A terrifying event will happen in this century , I &apos;m sure .
But I &apos;m also sure , because people are communicating together , the ability of ideas to meet and get close to friendship as never before . I &apos;m sure that technology will advance , and according to that quality of life will advance .
Because through computing , by crowdsourcing energy , from the smallest to the highest peak in this world that we &apos;ve created , not just the elite , but everyone is able to create ideas and make them meet and contain , we &apos;re going to get faster than any rate of development .
Thank you .

Good evening .
My name is Oldus .
I &apos;m a photographic artist from Russia .
I started my walk six years ago with a magical portrait of revealing many stereotypes about sexual and sexes and social issues &#91; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m Russian . I &apos;m selling drugs and child pornography ! &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Fodka is the water = Fodka ! &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) — using my photography to send a message . &#91; &quot; &quot; My husband , I still need a shitter today . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still trying to bring the camera in front of the camera .
I focus on sending meaningful messages , aesthetic , beauty , production and some ridiculous and crafting .
Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about my project , which I call miserable romance .
This is my art museum or my paintings inspired by pre-Revaluis in the mid-19th century .
I take the paintings and give them a new dimension and a contemporary meaning that talks about issues that surround me in Russia , taking pictures of people who aren &apos;t satisfied but have interesting stories .
This guy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but he &apos;s in high school and he &apos;s hiding dance class , and he &apos;s wearing a channel of violence , trying to look the same with his colleagues as a non-personal soldier .
But this boy has goals and dreams but it &apos;s afraid not to be accepted in his community , to be different is not easy , especially in Russia .
The next work is a metaphor .
And this is Kenta a a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t love me when I &apos;m angry . &quot; &quot; We say about a movie like that , but I never saw him angry .
He disappears his sense and his romantic ego , because in Russia , in men , it &apos;s not good to look romantic , but it &apos;s good to surround women and look like this violent weak .
( Laughter ) Sometimes in my work , I take the painting and I give it a new meaning and a new experience about its subject .
Sometimes , I want to compare facial features and play with words : ridicule , Iron Man , a man who weighs .
( Laughter ) By the paintings , I move the social issues that surround me in Russia to this talk .
An interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most 18 and 19 girls are ready and allies marriage .
We teach from childhood , that successful marriage means a successful life , so most girls are fighting to get a good husband .
And what about me ?
I am 27 years old .
For the Russian community , I am an old , very hopeless service of her marriage .
That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican warrior , in a wedding dress , desperate in my garden .
But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for their goals and their dreams , and to change those stereotypes .
Be brave and be risky — that helps .
Be fun and create some magic .
( Applause )
My name is Amira .
And 18 months ago , I was working on another job at Google , and I drew up with the idea of doing something about art and crafting to my boss at work that actually exists here , and allowed me to do that .
It took me 18 months .
A lot of negotiations and fun stories , I can tell you about it , with 17 interesting enthusiasm from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the objection .
There &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is very simple on the slide , which is access .
I grew up in India .
I got a good education — I &apos;m not skeptical — but I couldn &apos;t get to a lot of museums and artworks .
So when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
And in working at Google , I &apos;m trying to put this desire to increase the potential for access to technology together .
So being a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m probably going to start the exposure and tell you some of the most important things that we &apos;ve ever had .
So simply : you come to GoogletArtject.com.
You look around at these museums here .
We have Uffiasi , we have MoMA , Herceptible , Rijjing , the last Van launches .
I &apos;m actually going to visit one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York .
Two ways to enter — very simple .
Bang and , you &apos;re inside the museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombai , Mexico , doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move , you spend a lot of time .
You want to move around the museum ?
Open the diagram , and in one click , you jump .
You &apos;re there , and you want to go to the last markets .
Keep going , spend a lot of time .
Exploration .
( Applause ) Thank you . I haven &apos;t got to the best part .
( Laughter ) And so now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , the classes of Peter Brown in the dead .
I see an extra signal here .
If the museum provides the picture , you press it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all the actual data .
And for those of you who are really interested in the arts , you can click on this — but I &apos;m going to press it right now .
And this is a picture of the images that we took in what we call a gapkin technology .
So this picture , for example , has about , I think , about 10 billion pixels .
And a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try to show you what you actually get from 10 billion pixels .
It can be magnified very easily .
You see some interesting things happening here .
I love this guy ; his facial expressions are priceless .
But we really want to go deep .
So I started playing around with her , and I found something happening there .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Wait . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I went inside , and I started to notice that these kids were actually beating something .
I did some research , and I talked to some of my collaborators at dead , and I found that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which includes a stick in the refrigerator .
And it seemed to be very popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did that , but I learned something about it .
Now just to go deep , you can actually reach cracks .
Now just to give you a perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom in , so you can actually see what you get .
This is where we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best will come soon — so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly go to MoMA , again in New York .
So one of my favorites , the bright night of stars . Now the example I showed you was all about finding the details .
But what if you wanted to see the effects of the brush ?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this ?
We zoom in . We actually go inside .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts of the painting , and I &apos;m actually going to get to the cracks .
This is the picture of the night of the stars , I think you haven &apos;t seen this before .
I &apos;ll show you my other favorite feature .
There &apos;s a lot of other things here , but I don &apos;t have enough time .
This is the really cool part . It &apos;s called groups .
Whatever , any one — doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re rich , poor , if you have a proud house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go ahead and create your own online museum — create your own collection through all the images .
Simply , we go inside — and I &apos;ve created this powerful amplification call — it can just zoom in .
This is the bottom panel , which is at the National exhibition .
You can commit things , send them to your friends and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at this museum .
So I think , briefly , for me , the most important thing is that all the great things here don &apos;t actually come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t come , I think , even from museums .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t say that .
It comes from artists .
And this was my humble experience in this .
I mean , I &apos;m smiling in this digital medium to reconsider their work and show them appropriately on the Internet .
And the biggest question I &apos;m currently asked is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to the museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to download the experience .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a storyteller .
This is my work in life , telling stories , writing stories , and today I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about the art of storytelling , about some of the extraordinary creatures of nature called the Jane .
But before we get into it , let me show you a glimpse of my personal story .
And of course I &apos;m going to do that with the help of words , and also with the help of the geometric shape , which is the circle . And in my talk , you &apos;re going to get a number of circles .
I was born in Starsburgh , France for Paris .
And shortly after , my parents separated , and I came to Turkey with my mother .
Since then , I grew up as a single child of a single mother of a single mother .
And in the early &apos; 70s , in a cow , this was an unfamiliar situation .
And we were very proud of the big families , where parents were parents &apos; parents , and so I grew up seeing my mother as a heroic environment .
In fact , I grew up watching two different kinds of women .
On the one hand , my mother , a socialist , educated , scientifically , modern woman on the West .
On the other hand , my grandmother , who also funded my sponsor , was more spiritual and less culture and less rational .
She was a woman reading the cup to see the future and melting the bullets in strange forms to turn the eye and the envy .
A lot of people were reacting to my grandmother who were claiming sharp youth in their face or smiling at their hands .
And every time , my grandmother was labeled in Arabic words , and she took a red apple and then she printed it with a number of flowers that equals the number of fakes you want to take .
And then the chocolate surrounds by layer by circles of indoor ink .
And a week later , the patient revisit her to do a checkout .
And I realize that I shouldn &apos;t mention things like this in front of a crowd of researchers and scientists , and I should say , among all the people who visited my grandmother to treat their serious disease , I didn &apos;t see one person who had come back and he was unpleasant or unhealthy .
I asked her how to do it . Was that the power of the prostitution ?
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , the foolish is powerful . But you forget the power of circles . &quot; &quot; And from which I learned , plus a lot of things , a very valuable lesson . That if you want to destroy something in life , whether it &apos;s a young or a steam or a human spirit , all you have to do is surround it with thick walls .
It &apos;s going to melt into it .
We all live in a kind of cultural circle .
We all are .
We were born inside a family and a nation and a layer .
But if we don &apos;t have connection , in any way , to the underlying worlds behind our Muslim world , then we &apos;re also threatened to the danger of melting inside the walls .
Our imagination may condense , and our hearts will dismiss , and our humanity , if we ask the contaminants within our cultural partners .
Our friends , our neighbors , our colleagues , our families — if everyone in our circle was identical to us , that means we are surrounded by mirrors reflecting our images .
Another thing women like my grandmother in Turkey do is to cover mirrors with cloth , or comment them on the walls and they &apos;re packed .
And this is from the ancient Eastern tradition , based on information that supports that it &apos;s a bad thing for human health to spend a long time limited in the reflection of his image .
And ironically , living in societies like that pattern , today is one of the greatest risk facing the world in the age of globalization .
And this is happening everywhere , at liberals and conservatives , borders , believers , rich , poor , East and West alike .
We tend to form configurations that focus on the principle of the match , and then we give stereotypes to other kinds of people .
From my point of view , one way to transcend these cultural barriers can be achieved through storytelling .
Stories can &apos;t break boundaries , but they can drill holes in the walls of our brain .
And through these holes , we can take glimpses of others , and sometimes we like what we see .
I started writing literature at eight .
My mother came home with her blue Verizi dignity , and she asked me whether I was interested in my daily blogging .
And looking forward , I think it was a little bit worried about my mental health .
I &apos;ve always been telling stories at home , which is good , but I &apos;ve been telling them to good friends around me , and that &apos;s not a good thing .
I was a fairly introverted child communicating with auditory twins and apologizing things when I was hit ! So my mother thought it would be really good for me to give my everyday experience and my actions .
And what I didn &apos;t know was that I think my life was so bored , and that the last thing I wanted to do was write about myself .
And instead , I started writing about other people , and things that didn &apos;t actually happen .
And then my eternal passion started writing storytelling .
And so from the beginning , the storyteller literature for me was less than to consider a self-evil for being a journey beyond the range of human experience to life and other possibilities .
And please bear with me . I &apos;ll plan a circle and come back to this point .
Something else happened during that period .
My mother became a diplomat .
And so from this little neighborhood , believer in the myths , the middle class , where my grandmother , quickly moved to that high school in Madrid , where I was the only Turkish student .
And from here I had the first meeting of what I call &quot; &quot; foreign actor . &quot; &quot; In my class , there were children from all sexuality , and yet , this diversity , it didn &apos;t necessarily lead to an equal and multiplicity in class democracy .
Instead , creating an environment where every child is perceived , not as an independent individual , but as an actor of something larger .
We were a small model of the United Nations , which was fun , except in case something negative happens to be connected to one nation or another .
And then the child who is exposed to ridiculous , exhaustive and exhausting and endless .
And I had to suffer , because during the course of having a conversation , a military coup happened in my country , and tried to swap out of my gender , wash the Pope , and Turkey got zero in the Yugan contest of the song .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve changed a lot about school and I dreamt of becoming a sailor during those days .
And also , the first time I tasted cultural development was there .
Children were asking me about &quot; &quot; Midniniece Exploret , &quot; &quot; which I didn &apos;t see , and they looked at how many cigarettes I smoked a day , because they thought all the entropy were legal smokers , and they wondered what age I was going to start covering my hair .
I came to realize that the basic stereotypes of my country were : politics , cigarettes , love .
After Spain , we left to Jordan and then Germany and then we went back to England .
Wherever I went , I felt like my imagination was the only bag I could take with me .
Stories give me a sense of focus and continuity and coherence . Those three things are what was missing .
In my mid-20s , I moved to Istanbul , the city I love .
I lived in a diverse , vibrant neighborhood , and there I wrote a number of novels .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake happened in 1999 .
When I walked out of the building at 3 a.m. in the morning , I woke up a scene about the Sierra League .
He was a hot man , a mood crack and refused to sell things , and he didn &apos;t talk to the fans of people .
Sitting next to a smooth wall wore long black sharks and basketball hits his ear .
I watched the grocery opening up a two-pound cigarette box and offering a cigarette cigarette , and that was a picture of the earthquake night preserved in my memory to the day , with a conservative and a vegetarian who shared smoking on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and destruction , our earthquakes disappear and we all become one person even for a few hours .
But I always thought stories had a similar effect on us .
And I &apos;m not saying that the novel literature has the same importance of earthquake , but when we read a good novel , we leave our little apartment behind us , and we walk around at night alone , and we struggle to recognize people we &apos;ve never met before , and maybe we &apos;ve been biased against them .
Shortly after the earthquake happened , I joined the Women &apos;s College in Boston and then in Michigan .
I experienced the experience of transition , not as much as a geographic shift as a language shift .
I started writing literature in English .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , not a refugee , and they asked me why I write in English , but the transition between language gives me the opportunity to recreate myself .
I love writing in Turkish , and it &apos;s for me very poetic and emotionally , and I also love writing in English , and it &apos;s for me very , very emotional and mentally .
And that &apos;s what makes me feel connected to both languages differently .
For me and millions of people around the world today , English is a written language .
When you &apos;re a language speaker , what happens is you live there and you have a constant and permanent sense of frustration .
And as a language agent , we always want to say more , you know , let &apos;s take a little more concussion , and say better things , but we end up saying a little bit because there &apos;s a gap between mind and tongue .
And this gap is pretty exhausting .
But if we can get scared of it , we &apos;ll also find it motivating .
And that &apos;s what I found in Boston — that frustration was very motivating .
At this point in my life , I started my grandmother , who was tracking the course of my life with an increasingly anxious concern , including her daily inventions and asking me to marry unshaming , so that I could keep stabilizing after my marriage and forever .
And because God loved her , she was married .
( Laughter ) But instead of stabilizing , I moved to Arizona state .
And since my husband lives in Istanbul , I started moving between Arizona and Istanbul , and from on Earth , these two particular places can &apos;t be much more different .
I think aside I always wish was physical , physically and spiritual .
The stories elevated me , and I kept my parts and my memories together , as the glue of my existence .
And as much as I love stories , I recently started to see that they were losing their magic if when they looked at it as a story .
And this is a topic that I like to hope together .
When I first released my first novel written in English in America , I heard an interesting comment from a literary critic .
He said , &quot; &quot; I like your book , but I wish he &apos;d written differently .
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at the novel . There are a lot of Spanish and American characters with Spanish assets , but there &apos;s only one character in it , which is a man . &quot; &quot; And as the novel events fell in the campus of the University of Boston , it was for me a natural thing that the global characters would be more than the American characters . But I realized what they were discussing .
And I also realized that I was going to keep frustrating his hopes .
He wanted to see a representation of my identity .
He was looking for a woman in the book because I am .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we have to see how the world of identity policy has influenced how stories are being published and read and criticized .
Many authors are joining under the weight of this feeling , but nonWestern authors are more suffering .
If you &apos;re a woman and a writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you &apos;re going to wait for you to write stories about Muslim women and prefer to be sad stories , for a woman who is Muslim .
You expect you to write artistic , influential stories , diagnostic and leave the experimental and moderate approach to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening today in the literature world .
The writers are not seen as individual innovators , they &apos;re representatives of their own civilizations . A couple of authors from China , a little bit of Turkey , a little bit of Nigeria .
We all thought we had something very special , if not unique .
The author and the state , James Dwinian , interviewed him in 19849 where he was asked more than once about his sexual triangle .
When the constitutor tried to categorize it as a young writer , he stood in the line and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing wrong with me in others , and there &apos;s nothing in others that doesn &apos;t exist to me . &quot; &quot; When you try to policy identity to impose our officials to us , it becomes our freedom of imagination at risk .
There &apos;s a classification called multicultural diversity literature in which authors are categorized out of the Western world all under one Web .
I will never forget my multi-cultural reading on the Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
We were three authors , one of the Philippines , True and Indonesia , as a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason we got together was not because we shared the artistic method , or literature taste .
It was just because of our passports .
They expect multicultural writers to tell real stories , not fantasy .
The work of storytelling goes into storytelling .
And in this way , not only are the writers themselves , but also their imaginary characters become represented of something larger .
But as soon as I have to add , I have to consider a story that is more than a story that is not only the West &apos;s source .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And this is what I faced directly when I was attacked in 2005 for words in a novel that came to San Francisco for one of my random personalities .
I intend to write a constructive and multilayered novel about an Archimee man and a family that was raised by women &apos;s eyes .
My little story became a big issue . When I was interviewed .
Some people criticized me , while others pointed out to my book about the Armian conflict — Turkish .
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was imaginative .
It was just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; Just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to reduce my work .
I want to love and celebrate the narrative literature of what it is , and not as a way of achieving something very powerful .
The writers are linked to their political opinions , and there are good political narratives in the literature square , but the language of literature is not the language of current politics .
Chef said , &quot; &quot; The presentation of a solution to a problem and the right way to ask the question is two totally separate things .
The second task is the responsibility of the artist . &quot; &quot; We lack identity policy and connect us to literature .
The first one is interested in universal designs .
The second one is interested in subtle differences .
The first one is to draw boundaries .
The second one doesn &apos;t recognize threats .
Iventilation policy is made of solid solidarity .
The literature is running water .
In the eight-year-old age , there were hunter-gatherer dancers called them &quot; &quot; candidate . &quot; &quot; They were going to the cafe , where they were telling a story in front of a audience of listeners and often they were improvising .
And with each new person in the story , the &quot; &quot; candidate &quot; changed his voice as a body of that character .
Everybody could go to the cafe and listen to my judgment , you know , ordinary people , even the devil , Muslims and non-Muslims .
Stories are all across the border , like &quot; &quot; The narratives of religion are face-to-face , &quot; &quot; which was common all over the Middle East , the Somalia of Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
Today , stories are still continuing to cross borders .
When the Palestinians and Israeli women talk to each other , they often don &apos;t listen to each other , but the Palestinian reader still reading a novel to a Jewish author , and vice versa , in relation and empathy with the narrator .
The literature has to move us to the other side .
And if he can &apos;t take us there , it &apos;s not a good bear .
The books saved that introverted child , the tour that I had ever been .
But I realize the danger of my book .
When the Roman religion humiliated a twin of his spirit , the emblematic religion , the first thing he did was to throw a Roman book in the water and sit down and watch the letters go away .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The science that doesn &apos;t take you any further from yourself is a worse science than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem of today &apos;s cultures is not a lack of knowledge , we know a lot about each other , or that &apos;s what we think , but the science that doesn &apos;t make us step beyond ourselves , makes us elusive , far away and innovative .
There &apos;s a metaphor I love : &#91; Living like a drawing carpet &#93; .
And you know , one of the legs of the carpenter is static and arbitrary at some point .
The other leg is constantly rotating to draw a wide circle .
And so are my novels .
A constant part of Istanbul with roots that are inherent , and the other part is roaming around the world , linked to different cultures .
And from this perspective , I like to consider my local and global narratives at the same time , from here and from everywhere .
Those of you who have visited Istanbul , you may have seen the palace of the high door , which has been a shop for the top of the eight-year-old sectors for more than 400 years .
In the palace , right outside the lucky jewelry , there &apos;s a space called the Gene Collaboratory .
They fall between buildings .
I had this idea .
We often draw from those places that are entrenched between things .
And we look at it as a bias of supernatural creatures like a embryo , creature from a fire to smoke and they &apos;re a symbol of brains .
And what I want to get to is that that surrounding space may be the most important thing that the book and the artists need .
When I started writing a novel , I had to do with language and the ability to change .
I &apos;d better not know what &apos;s going to happen in the next 10 pages .
I like to be surprised by my personality .
Maybe I &apos;m going to write about a Muslim woman in one of my novels and maybe it &apos;s going to be a very happy story . And in my next novel , maybe I &apos;ll write about a college professor from Norway , a poet and a poet .
As long as our hearts were our sources , we could write about anything and everything .
Uri Lord once said , &quot; &quot; We taught white parents to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , so I exist . &quot; &quot; And she looked at me , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am . &quot; &quot; I think it was a great paradigm shift .
And yet , why is this , when we teach creative writing , the first thing we teach students is : write what you know ?
Maybe that &apos;s not the right start .
So fictional literature doesn &apos;t necessarily have to write about our entities or our ingredients or what our identity is .
We have to teach lighter and ourselves how to expand our hearts and write about what makes us feel .
We have to get out of our cultural isolation and visit the other and then the other .
In closing , stories like cycling , to draw circles by circles .
Stories relate to all human beings , no matter what their political identity is , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I would like to end with this old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Hold on , let &apos;s be friends if for once ; let &apos;s make life simpler for us ; let &apos;s love and love and love if for a while ; the Earth will not be contaminated for a human . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m Gene Mungal . I &apos;m a toy designer .
We &apos;re doing more in the game world , but I mean .
So far , the Worldd Word Warcraft players have spent five , 93 million years solving the virtual problems of Elizabeth .
That &apos;s not necessarily bad .
We evolved to become more cooperative and friendly .
And we &apos;re actually building stronger social relations as a result .
Five million people use it every month .
And that &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
He &apos;s doing great . He &apos;s looking at why .
But it &apos;s not in any perfect position .
We have to start making real life more like a game .
Before we had great games , we had the joints of the song .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
Based on Heroft , 18 years later the king decided that they would play a final game .
We want to imagine a legendary win , and then give people the resources to achieve that mythic win .
We made this game in 2008 .
This is a story and an interesting adventure for you .
We have a picture story . We have development in skills like local understanding , sustainable scientific relationships , vision , dependence .
The dirty jobs crew and I returned to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
It &apos;s only a few tens of square miles away , it &apos;s in Rocky Mountains .
And it was about the farm issue .
And my role in the show of those of you who haven &apos;t looked at — it &apos;s kind of simple .
I &apos;m a beginner , and I work with people who don &apos;t actually have jobs .
And my responsibility is just a joke and provide friendship account from what it looks like to be these people , one day in their lives .
We work for those of us who are asking for that — like a nourist . Great .
We go to Greg and we fall in a hotel and I realize the next day that statisticians will be an important part of this work so .
Usually , I don &apos;t do any research at all .
But , this is a sensitive subject , and I work in the Discovery Channel , and we want to visualize exactly what we do , and we certainly want to do that with a lot of respect for animals .
So the zoo community called me and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to count some of the campaign , can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s simple and clear . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a direct way — they basically use rubber tape , like this , but a little bit smaller .
This is actually one about the play papers I got yesterday , and there was a kind of intimacy .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The tape applies to the tail , tightly .
And then the last tape is applied to the deck bag , tightly .
The blood flows down and down , and a week later the male bone is cut .
&quot; Great ! I got it . &quot;
Well , I &apos;ll call SPCA to emphasize this — they make sure .
And I also called PETA just for fun and they don &apos;t like it , but they do .
Well , that &apos;s basically how we do that .
The second day I came out .
And I gave the horse to go to get the campaign and take them to the era that we built , and we &apos;re walking into the business of raising the animal .
Melani is the wife of Albert .
Albert is the shepherd .
Melani takes the sheep — her hands — one hand on each of his right legs , and the same on the left .
And the load goes into the mail , and it opens it up .
Okay . Great .
Albert goes , and I follow Albert , and the crew around me .
I always watch the process of doing it the first time before I try to do it .
Being a coach , you know , you do that .
Albert put his hand in his pocket to pull , you know , to show the black rubber tape but what came out was a knife instead .
And I said this is not a rubber band , you know .
And he had just flipped on and opened it in the way the sun had just been coming from the rock mountain — it was — it was fantastic .
In space in about two seconds , Albert was holding the knife between the gum of the tail , next to the back of the tail , and very quickly the tail went and was in the bear that I held .
In the thumb second and the big sin , they got very well , and he had a pen bag , he held it in his grip .
And he pulls it towards him , and then , he takes the knife and puts it on the side .
Now you think you know what &apos;s going to happen , Michael , you don &apos;t know ? Well .
He grabs that , grabs it on the end of his shoulder , and then he grabs the shipping bag and pushes it up , and then his head goes down , ignore my perspective , and what I hear is the inspiration sound , and he makes the noise swallow that looks like he &apos;s slipping off the wall of a sticky and I &apos;m not even kidding .
Can we run the video ?
I &apos;m not kidding — we can &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I think it &apos;s better to talk through images .
So , I do something that I &apos;ve never done before in filming dirty jobs , ever .
I say , &quot; &quot; Hey , stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , and we use the first shot , and we don &apos;t use the second shot .
You don &apos;t use writing , no programming , and there &apos;s no nonsense .
We &apos;re not fooling around us , and we &apos;re not training , we &apos;re photographing and succeeding in photography !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop that crazy . I mean , you know .
( Laughter ) And this is crazy .
And we can &apos;t do this . And Albert said , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are members in this Milo that &apos;s not the way we should do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And they let me explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , the rubber .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the pregnancy bleed — we &apos;re in five continents , guys .
We &apos;re showing twice a day on the Discovery channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; He goes into the box and pulls a bag of little rubber tiles .
Melani takes another pregnancy , puts it on the table , and the rubber tie is on the tail , and the second tie is on the port bag .
The sheep lies on the ground , the pregnancy takes two steps , and it falls , wakes up , gets a little shaking , takes another steps , and it falls again .
I said , this is not a good indication of this pregnancy at all .
He woke up , walks into the corner and grabs out of trouble .
And I look at pregnancy and I say , &quot; Albert , how long ? When will it erase ? &quot;
When will it erase ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; On a day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; One day ! How long will it take to take ? &quot; &quot; In a week . &quot;
And in the meantime , the pregnancy had to do the little procedure was , you know , he was jumping , and the bleeding stopped .
It &apos;s , you know , throwing grass , dancing joy .
And I flew away with how I was wrong , in that second .
And I remembered how I was completely wrong , often .
( Laughter ) And I particularly mentioned that what &apos;s ridiculous is that day because I had to do what Albert did and there &apos;s like 100 of these campaign in the afternoon , and suddenly everything started to look like a German porn , and I &apos;m a Milan admire taking the pregnancy , putting it on the table , open it up .
Albert Muhammad Knife .
Inside and the tail comes out .
And I walk in again , grab the knife of the art , and he starts waving for me .
Albert Translor , &quot; &quot; Make it up . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; I pay more than that . &quot;
I do .
The organs start to appear , and they look like the thumb , coming towards you , and they say , &quot; &quot; Dear .
Just muscle it . &quot; &quot; And I heard it , and I heard all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how — how did I get here ?
How — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain explodes alone suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rocky Mountains , and all I can think of is Aristotle &apos;s definition of the institution .
You know , Aristotle and the tragedy is the moment the hero comes to face with his own identity .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; What is this complex metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking about right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this idea out of my head , and I can &apos;t forget the scene and take it out of my eyes , and I did what I had to do .
I went and took them .
I took them like this , and I took my face off again .
And I &apos;m standing there and the two stories on my ears .
( Laughter ) Now I can &apos;t get it — I can &apos;t shake metaphor .
Well , I was still in a poem in Aristotle , and I was thinking — all of a sudden , two collisions come in my head and I hadn &apos;t heard of these phrases since I was studying with my classic teacher and he was digging them in my head .
And they &apos;re anagrais and perperperpetual .
Anagiis and Superipeech .
It &apos;s a word from the origin of the Greek Anagasis .
Literally , moving from ignorance to knowledge anagesis .
What our network does , they &apos;re dirty jobs .
I even live in anageses every single day .
Great .
And the other word is , &quot; &quot; perivic , &quot; &quot; and this is a moment in the big tragedy , you know — Urebecis and Sufkolis — the moment that Odyssey had his moment , and suddenly he realized that the trap was sleeping with the presence of children with his mother . OK .
That &apos;s the bad thing for perperperpetual .
And this metaphor in my head — I got anagrams and Superipetia on my ears .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , this device is great .
When you start looking for Peripetia , you find that everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The sixth sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
He goes through the whole film trying to help the little kid see two dead people and then boom — oh , I &apos;m dead — Superpetia .
You know ?
It &apos;s going to shock the audience if you know it right .
What &apos;s new about Matrix , you know ?
Oh , I live in a computer program — that &apos;s weird .
These discoveries that lead to sudden perception , and they had , over 200 dirty jobs , and they were with me all the time , but these discoveries took me away and I was unprepared for them .
And as I stood there , I looked happily at the pregnancy that we just had — but it seemed OK .
Looking at the poor little thing that I did that right , but I was shocked if I was wrong about that , if I was often wrong , literally , what other misconceptions would I be able to comment on ?
Look now , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who works in this field .
And I talk to him .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Mike .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this kind of thing or not , do you realize that you &apos;ve photographed the viewer in every country ?
I was working in mining , and I worked in fishing , and I worked hard and I worked in all major industries .
I was standing side by side with these guys that our politicians couldn &apos;t do , and for once every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can see Hillary still doing footage of the wall and the gecko underneath her ear , with the steel workers .
I mean , these are the people I work with every day .
And if you have what you say about their ideas , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
Because , folks , you know , four years . You know , it &apos;s in my head , and the organs on my ears , and the ideas are rotating .
And after photography , dirty jobs didn &apos;t change , in terms of performance , but they changed to me , personally .
Now , when I &apos;m talking about the show , I &apos;m no longer just a novel you heard 10 times .
But I also start to talk about some of the other things that I understood wrong , and some other concepts of the work that I just did on sacred assumptions , and no longer .
People with dirty tasks are happier than you think .
As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start the miniaturization , &quot; &quot; Look for the Union , &quot; &quot; and every passionate worker .
I &apos;m telling you that these people who work are balanced can &apos;t imagine .
Roadkpill pill Skype whistles and they work , swear in God , I worked with them .
I &apos;ve got this kind of amazing symmetry on their lives .
And I see that over and over again .
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these cows .
You follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here in the last 36 hours .
You follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
Maybe the worst advice I ever got .
( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and achieving them , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard when they grow up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do in my life , but I was told if you were tracking your passion , it would work .
And I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Collins , pig nurses in Las Vegas who collects food waste from the cassettes and offers it to pigs .
Why ? Because there &apos;s a lot of protein in things that we don &apos;t eat and pigs grow at a rate that &apos;s twice as fast as normal , and it &apos;s a rich pig nurse , and it &apos;s good for the environment , and it spends its days with incredible services , and it smells of hate , but God saves it .
It &apos;s a great living gain .
I asked him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he would laugh at you .
The guy deserves — he &apos;s got a show of about 60 million dollars for his farm , and he refused the show — it was out of Las Vegas .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He stopped , and he watched the guys come out of front of him , and he kept his trainer .
And I hear this story over and over again .
Matt Freud , who &apos;s a Albane farmer in New Kansen , who woke up one day and realized that his cow deserves more than her milk , if it can be used to make these purple for degradable flowers .
And now he &apos;s following it to Wal-Mart .
Try his passion — men — come on .
I started looking at a passion look , and I started looking at efficiency versus efficiency , as Tim talked about earlier , and that &apos;s the big difference .
I started looking at collective work and design , and basically all of these disparities are called success that has been consistent with the art of management all over the world right now .
Those things — all of a sudden they turned upside down .
safety — safety first .
And that is that I &apos;m going to come back to you , you know , the safety organization , health and home , and the community of animal companions . What if the safety and health organization were wrong ?
I mean , this is a trick , what am I about to say , but what if safety was really in the third position or the first ?
Is that okay ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
What I mean to say is that my safety has more value than these crazy jobs as much as the people I work with , but they do it the right way , they &apos;re not there to talk about safety first .
And they know that other things come first — the achievement of the project comes first , doing and doing the project .
And I &apos;ll never forget , in the Pearling Sea , on the boat of the commodities with fishing players , which I work in in in the first season .
We &apos;re about 100 kilometers off the coast of Russia and 50 feet to sail , big waves , and the green water coming into the leadership room , right ?
This is one of the greatest dangerous environments I &apos;ve ever seen , and I came back with the man , and I &apos;m copying these fish .
So , I &apos;m 40 feet above the surface of the ship , which is like looking at the upper part of the shoe , you know , it does that in the ocean .
It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to remember .
I &apos;m down , and I &apos;m going to the leadership room and whatever I say , with a lot of skepticism , &quot; Captain , Security and Health Organization . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; The Security and Health Organization ? — the ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
( Laughter ) But at that moment , what he said couldn &apos;t repeat in the bottom of 48 .
And it can &apos;t repeat that a factory or any construction site .
But he looked at my face , and he said , &quot; &quot; My son — he &apos;s a Sinny , by the way , calling me my son , and I love that — as he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my son , I &apos;m a fishing boat .
My responsibility is to bring you home and you &apos;re alive .
And my responsibility is to come home more wealth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s back to you .
And for the rest of that day , safety comes first .
I was like — the idea of creating this lie — this is the feeling of satisfaction when we talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility and being our responsibility , and vice versa .
Anyway , in a lot of things .
I can talk about the few differences that we &apos;ve made on ourselves and an endless list of ways we &apos;ve misunderstood it .
But what &apos;s the point of all this ?
I &apos;ve created a theory , and I &apos;m going to share with you now in the next two and 30 seconds .
And this is what happens — the war has declared work , as a society , for all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s the Cold War . Really .
We didn &apos;t try to do that ; we didn &apos;t write our drink in the blind way , but we did .
And this war has grown at least four foreigners , and certainly in Hollywood .
The way we visualize people on TV , it &apos;s funny .
If there &apos;s a race , it weighs 300 pounds , and it speaks a lot of bad speech , let &apos;s admit that .
We see it all the time .
That &apos;s what the knife looks like , right ?
We turn them into heroes , or we transport them to the stage .
That &apos;s what television does .
And we &apos;re trying so hard that dirty jobs aren &apos;t , and that &apos;s the first reason to do this work and I &apos;m not cheating .
This war was posted on Madison Street .
I mean , a lot of commercial ads that come from there — on a message road , what &apos;s really said ?
Your life would be better if you had done a little bit less if you didn &apos;t have a job to accomplish , if you could go home earlier , if you had retired early , that &apos;s all there was , over and over and over again .
Washington — I can &apos;t even start talking about the deals and policies that affect this place the bottom line of jobs available because I don &apos;t really know .
And I recently learned on this front in the war .
And this , folks , Silicon Valley , I mean how many people have any iPhone ?
And how many people have Blackberry ?
We &apos;re connected to these devices .
And I &apos;m never going to celebrate this gives a bad impression about the technology revolution .
We love Jihad , not appropriate for this audience .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m not going to suggest that regeneration and imitation is not a waste of time .
And nobody celebrates fake things as they celebrate the dirty jobs because they know how it &apos;s going to happen .
And the people who use the iPhone have shared values , shared systems , over and over again .
All that — that &apos;s what makes this device both creative .
So , we have these new tools , you know .
We have tools today that don &apos;t look like a room and a field .
It looks like these things that we &apos;re walking around with .
So the collective impact of everyone , so this was a lot of humiliation and a lot of jobs .
And I realized , maybe a little too late in this game — and they realized it wasn &apos;t , because I don &apos;t know if I could do more than 200 of these things , but we would do as much as we could .
And for me the most important thing to realize the importance of things facing attitudes face to face and actually get things wrong , not just about organs .
I get it wrong .
So , we think — who we are , I mean I — that the thing I do is talk about the PR campaign for work , manual work , and skilled labor .
Somebody has to be there to talk about the exponential benefits .
I mean , with serious property . A lot of property that we grew up with , but you know , we lost a few of them .
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
Infrastructure is a huge deal structure .
This war on work , which I think is there , has losses like other wars .
First of all , infrastructure has reduced rates to go to business schools .
Every year , the number of electrodes , the carpenters , the knife , the bathrooms , the mechanics of pipes , the steam .
The infrastructure jobs that everyone talks about creating are expressions of these people , who were in decline , over and over again .
Within that , we had two trillion dollars , at a minimum , according to the American Society of civic engineers , that we needed to spend so that we could invent the infrastructure that was currently banned in the fourth place .
So , if I run anything , and not like that , I would simply say that the jobs that we hope to accomplish that we hope to create will not last if the jobs that people want .
And I know that the goal of this conference is to celebrate the things that are close to us , but I also know that clean and dirty are not reflective .
They &apos;re two sides of his work , just like innovation and imitation , like risks and responsibility , and like Superipee and Ganeses like the poor sheep , which I hope is not terrifying anymore , like my time .
It was great to talk to you and go back to work , if you will ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very small idea , but it can open up the sphere for billions of big ideas that are tragic inside of us .
And my little idea of doing that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This room is full of elite women in this room .
It &apos;s full of sleeping women .
I learned the hard way to sleep .
Two and a half years ago , I was blinded .
I broke my head in the office , I broke my face bones , and doctors brought five poles to my right eye .
And then I started my journey to research and explore for sleep value .
And in my study , I met doctors , of course , and scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the best way to increase productivity and important , and the happiness of life is to get enough sleep .
( Applause ) And as women , we &apos;re going to lead ourselves to the top of this revolution , this is a feminist issue .
And we &apos;re going to sleep on our way to the summit literally , yeah , we &apos;re going to sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , the lack of sleep is the symbol of chaos .
I was invited to dinner recently , and the man said , &quot; &quot; Wow , it didn &apos;t last four hours .
I felt like I had to say to him , but I didn &apos;t — I wanted to say , &quot; &quot; You know .
If you grow an hour more , this meeting would be much more fun than it is now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And there &apos;s now a kind of a mood in terms of the lack of sleep among men .
And especially here in Washington , if you have a date with somebody in the morning to eat a breakfast meal , and I said , &quot; &quot; What do you see at 8 a.m. ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; This time is too late for me , but it &apos;s okay , I &apos;m going to do some visual calls and I &apos;m going to ask you eight , and they think this is really bad for me , but they &apos;re not really bad at the business .
So the level of intelligence is high .
It doesn &apos;t necessarily mean being a successful driver , because the notion of leadership means being able to see our iceberg borrowing our Titanic ship .
And unfortunately , there &apos;s a lot of ice mountains that are hitting our teeth .
In fact , I think that the Brothers of Lihman , the Takai Titanic , if they were brothers and sisters to inspire , they would still be here today .
( Applause ) Because while the brothers would be completely busy over the clock and a week , maybe the sisters would have noticed the iceberg because they would have had enough hours of sleep for seven and a half hours or eight hours , and they would be able to see the big picture of things .
So while we &apos;re facing a lot of disadvantages in our world today , it &apos;s good for the personal level to bring pleasure , appreciation and efficiency in our lives and to get the best production of our work and the world .
I &apos;m asking you to close your eyes and discover the great ideas that are underway you and turn your movements a little bit and explore the power of sleep enough .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , as Chris pointed out , I study human brain functions and human brains .
And I want you to think for a minute about what it &apos;s about .
Here &apos;s how much jelly — three pounds of jelly you can put in your palm and you can think of the expansion of space between stars .
He can think of infinitely meaningless meaning and can think of itself that you think about infinitely meaningless .
And this remarkable repetitive fertility that we call self-awareness is what I think is the Holy Grail in neuroscience and hope that one day we will understand how it is .
Well , how do you study this mysterious device ?
I mean , you have a hundred billion neurons , little proteins , interact with each other , and from this activity shows a set of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How does this happen ?
There are several ways to take human brain function .
One of the ways , which we &apos;re using mainly is to look at patients who have been permanently harmful in a small brain region where there &apos;s a genetic change in a small area of the brain .
What happens next is not a complete decline in all your mental abilities , a kind of severe break in your mental ability .
What you get is a very selective loss of one job with keeping all the other functions , and that gives you some confidence in making sure that that that part of the brain somehow gets lost in this task .
So you can identify the function of an area and then figure out what the role does to produce this particular function .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you some remarkable examples of this .
In fact , I &apos;ll give you three examples , six minutes each of them , during this talk .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
If you look at the first slide there &apos;s this temporal lobe , the frontal lobe , the prefrontal lobe , OK — the branches that represent the brain .
And if you look , spinning away inside the surface of the periodic cage , you can &apos;t see it here is a little structure called the gyrus gyrus .
And I watched the facial area because when it damages , you can &apos;t know the faces of people .
You can still know them from their voices and say , yes , that &apos;s Joe , but you can &apos;t look at their faces and recognize them , right ?
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
I mean , you know that you &apos;re because when you tweak your image , you also know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really know yourself .
Okay . Now , this syndrome is known to be a harm worthy of the parallel wrapping .
But there &apos;s another rare , very rare syndrome , in fact , very few doctors have heard about it , even neuroscientists .
Her name is Capgras , and this patient , unlike that , was completely normal , had been exposed to a head injury , and out of the coma , unlike that , looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; Mom , that woman , that woman , but she &apos;s an injury .
She &apos;s another woman who supports she &apos;s my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why is this happening ?
Why somebody — and this person is completely mindful and smart at all , but when his mother sees his mother , he answers them and says it &apos;s not his mother .
Now , the most common explanation of this , which you &apos;ll find in every textbook of psychology , is Freud &apos;s point of view , which is that this man — and this argument also applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;m just going to talk about men .
When you were a little kid , a young child , you had a very sexually attractive to your mother .
This is called the Odyssey node of Freud .
I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is Freud &apos;s standard vision .
And then it grows , the cortex evolves , and these sexual desire stops for your mother .
Thank God , or none of you would be sexually excited when you see your mother .
And then what happens is , there &apos;s a lesion of your head , that damages the cortex , allowing these sufficient desire to go out , so badly to the surface , and suddenly unconsciously you find yourself sexually excited about your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , this is my mother , why am I sexually excited ?
This is another woman . She &apos;s skeptical . &quot; &quot; This is the only explanation that your damaged brain does .
This is not understandable to me , this argument .
It &apos;s very good , like all Freud &apos;s arguments — ( Laughter ) — but it &apos;s not understandable because I saw that same illusion , a patient with the same illusion of his PowerPoint dog . ( Laughter )
He says , &quot; &quot; Dr. , this is not my elephant , it &apos;s just like my movie , but it &apos;s another dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Now , try to use Freud &apos;s explanation here .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re going to start talking about sufficient brutality in all human beings , or something like that , and that &apos;s very silly , of course .
Well , what actually happens ?
To explain these strange disorders , we look at the structure and functions of natural visual pathways in the brain .
Normally , the visual signals go in , into the eyes article , and you go to the visual areas of the brain .
In fact , there are 30 regions in the back of the brain that are only responsible for vision , and after analyzing all of that , the message goes into a little structure called Mascular Tiger , where you see faces .
There are neurons that are sensitive to faces .
You can call it the facial area of the brain , right ?
I talked about it a little bit .
Now , when you wrap this area , you lose your ability to see faces , right ?
But from this area , the message goes into a device called the amygdala groups in the limbic system , the emotional center of the brain , and this structure , called the LED measures the emotional importance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it a predator ? Is it a predator ? Is it a wedding cousin ?
Or is it a very frightening thing , like a hair , or a piece of chalk , or — I don &apos;t want to signal that but — shoes , or something like that ? OK ?
And you can completely ignore it .
So if the closed apple is persistent , and that &apos;s important , the message goes to the non-zero-sum nervous system .
Your heart starts beating faster .
You start to race to get rid of the heat you &apos;re going to produce — from the muscle effort .
And that &apos;s luckily , because we can put two electrodes on your hand and measure the change in skin resistance from sweating .
So I can determine , when you look at something if you &apos;re excited or excited or not , OK ?
And I &apos;ll come up with this a little bit later .
So my idea was , when this person looks at something , when they look at — anything in fact , you go to areas of view and — nonetheless , it analyzes the invasive spectrum , and you can see it as the gasoline plant , or a table , or even it &apos;s your mother anyway , right ?
And then the message goes to the amygdala groups , and then you go to the non-zero-sum nervous system .
But perhaps in this person , the connection from the amygdala groups to the limbic system — the emotional center of the brain — has fallen into the accident .
But because the reinforced apple is intact , this guy can recognize his mother , and he says , &quot; &quot; Of course , it &apos;s like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the communications of emotional centers are broken , he says , &quot; &quot; But why , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t feel warm ? &quot; &quot; Or the gift , by the way ? Right ?
( Laughter ) So , he says , &quot; &quot; How can I understand that there are no emotions ?
This can &apos;t be my mother .
She &apos;s another woman who claims she &apos;s my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test that ?
Well , what you do is , if I take any of you here , put it in front of a screen , and we measured the electrical responses of your skin , and we show images on the screen , I can measure your sweat when you see something , like a table or a parachute — of course , you don &apos;t burn .
But when I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or even a pin , you start to sweat , right ?
And also , believe it or not , if you show you your mother &apos;s image — and I talk here about normal people — you start to race .
You don &apos;t need to be Jewish .
( Laughter ) Now , what happens — what happens if I show this to the patient ?
Take the patient and show him images on the screen and measure the electrical responses to his skin .
Tables , chairs and poetry , nothing happens , as in natural people , but when you see it as a picture of his mother , the electrical response doesn &apos;t exist .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother because the wire from vision to emotional centers is cut .
It &apos;s natural because visual regions are natural and natural — they laugh , they cry , and so on — but the wire from seeing to emotions is cut , and so he has that illusion that his mother is a lie .
This is a beautiful example of what we &apos;re working on , taking a strange psychological syndrome , and it seems incomprehensible and saying that the basic Freud concept is wrong , and the fact that you can come up with a precise concept based on neurological anatomy known to the brain .
By the way , if this patient goes , and his mother calls him from the next room — calls him — lifts the speaker , he says , &quot; &quot; Oh , Mom , how are you ? Where are you from ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no illusion through the telephone .
And then an hour later it comes , and he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
My mother looks exactly like this . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
The reason is that there &apos;s a different trajectory that goes from brain hearing centers to emotions centers , and that hasn &apos;t been cut through the accident .
And that explains why his mother can know through the phone , no problem .
When he sees her face to face , he says she &apos;s a injury .
Well , how are all these complex circuits organized in the brain ?
Is it nature , genes , or construct ?
And we come to this dilemma by looking at other strange syndrome called the fake limbs .
And you all know what the illusion is .
When the arm is invented , or the leg when it &apos;s invented , because of Ghana , or when you lose it in the war , for example , in the Iraq War — and this is a serious problem now — you &apos;ll continue to feel clearly there &apos;s the missing arm , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an illusion arm or an important leg .
In fact , you can feel this in any part of the body .
Believe it or not , even with internal organs .
I had patients removed from the uterus — uterosexual uterus — who had vascular uterus , including vascular menstruation at the same time of the month .
In fact , a student asked me the other day , did they get their periods ?
( Laughter ) Scientific Research , but we didn &apos;t follow it .
Well , now the next question is , what can you learn about the important limbs of the tests ?
One of the things that we found is , about half of the patients on the front limb call that they can move the gut limb .
She approached his brother &apos;s shoulder , responds to the phone when he rings , swallowed with his headache .
These are very convincing , very alive feelings .
The patient is not talented .
He knows that the arm is not there , but , nonetheless , it &apos;s an exciting experience for the patient .
But nonetheless , about half of the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
The fake side — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But Dr. , the fake side is paralyzed .
It &apos;s static in Churing and it &apos;s very painful .
If I could move it , the pain may be gone . Now , why is the illusion side paralyzed ?
This looks like a contradiction in language .
But when we looked at the files of cases , what we found was that , these people who had paralyzed parties , the original arm was paralyzed by damage in the linear nerves .
The original nerve of the arm was cut , cut , for example , in a motorcycle accident .
So the patient had an arm , which hurts him , in a shoulder for months , or a year , and then trying to get rid of the pain in the arm , the arm bulbs , and then the fake arm acquires the same pain , right ?
This is a serious medical problem .
Patients become depressed .
Some criticize suicide , right ?
So how do we address this syndrome ?
Why do you have a paralyzed portion ?
When I looked at the profile of the case , I found that he had an arm already , and the nerves that provided this arm had fallen , and the real arm was paralyzed , and it was placed in a shoulder for several months before the amputation , and that pain moved to the fake arm .
Why is this happening ?
When the arm was there , but paralyzed , the brain was sending it to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move around , &quot; &quot; but the visual response comes back and says , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move it around . No . Move it . No . Move it . Don &apos;t move . No .
And this goes into the neural circuits in the brain , and we call this learning paralysis , OK ?
The brain learns , because of a hybrid connection , that only for the arm to move gives the sense of a paralyzed arm .
And then , when you grow the arm , this educated paralysis goes into the — into your image of your body and your fake arm , OK ?
Now , how do these patients help ?
How do you ask the idea of paralysis so that you can get this very painful convulsion of his fake arm ?
Well , what we said , what if I sent it to the fake arm , but I gave him the visual response that the arm was able to do something , right ?
You might be afraid of the illusional pain , the fake muscle disturbing .
How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
But it costs millions of dollars .
So I took a way to do that for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
( Laughter ) Okay ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
You have a box of cardboard with a mirror in half , and then you put the fake arm — so the first patient , Derek , came to me .
His hand was smiling 10 years ago .
He had a lesion infection in the infection , so the nerves cut off and the arm was paralyzed , in an shoulder for a year , and then she left .
He had a fake arm , very painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
The fake arm was paralyzed .
And he came there , and he gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call the mirror box , OK ?
And the patient put his left vagina arm , which was woven in a spill , on the left side of the mirror , and the natural arm on the right side of the mirror , and did the same thing , the springy , and look inside the mirror , what does it feel ?
He was looking at the fake arm and he returned to life , because he was looking at the reflection of the natural arm in the mirror , as if the natural arm returned to life .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Now look , your fake arm — your real fingers , or move your real fingers and you look at the mirror . &quot; &quot; He would have visual impression that the fake arm moves , right ?
This is obvious , but the amazing thing is that , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my fake arm moves again , and pain , the spinal cord , recover . &quot; &quot; And remember , the first patient I come from — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) The first patient who came , and I looked at the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at the reflection of your peculiar arm . &quot; &quot; And he started to see me , but he didn &apos;t see Pia .
He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a living experience .
Well , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your natural and fake hand . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my fake hand . You know it . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your natural hand . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my fake hand moves again , I can &apos;t believe it !
And my pain went . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
And then I said , &quot; &quot; Open your eyes . &quot; &quot; Open your eyes .
&quot; And move your natural hand . &quot;
&quot; Nothing — it &apos;s enlightened in a kiss again . &quot;
&quot; Okay , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , my God , she &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
So it was like a child in a desalination shop .
And I said , well , that proves my theory of paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I won &apos;t take the Nobel Prize to get someone to move their fake arm .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s totally useless , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But I started to think , there might be other kinds of paralysis that you see in neuroscience , like a stroke , different communication disorders — there might be a learning part of those that you can overcome with a simple machine like a mirror .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , look &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , this man can &apos;t hold a mirror everywhere to get rid of his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , look , take it home and pass it for a week or two .
It might be , after a while of exercise , you can take away the mirror , and ask the idea of paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm , and get yourself out of pain . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , take it home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s anyway , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; And he took it home , and two weeks later he called me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Dr. , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I went . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What did you go ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was going .
( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this fake arm I had 10 years ago ?
I went . &quot; &quot; And I said — I worried , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I mean , I changed the perception of this man for his body , what about patients , morality , and everything else ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does that disturb you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , the last three days I didn &apos;t have a fake arm so that I didn &apos;t pain as a fake , no contract , I don &apos;t help my fake , all those dreams went .
But the problem is that my thumb is still slower than the shoulder , and your friend doesn &apos;t get to the shoulder . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So you can change the design and put it on my forehead and I can , you know , do it and get rid of my fake fingers ? &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m kind of magical .
Why is this happening ?
Because the brain is facing a tremendous sensory struggle .
You get messages from sight saying that the fake arm has come back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no proper receptor , muscle signals that say there &apos;s no arm , right ?
And your motor command says there &apos;s a arm , and because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there &apos;s no fake , there &apos;s no arm , right ?
You go to a kind of denial — you break down signals .
And when the arm disappears , the reward is that the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have pain without a floating body there , in space .
That &apos;s the reward .
Now , this technique was tested by tens of patients by other groups in Helinsky , so it could prove its value as a treatment for illusional pain , and indeed , some people tried to employ it in treatment .
Pull , usually you think it &apos;s damage in fiber , nothing you can do .
But it turns out that part of the polio is a learning paralysis , and it might be possible to treat this part using mirrors .
And this went to medical trials , to help many patients .
Well , now let me move to the third part of my talk , which is about another strange phenomenon called Sinnesia .
This was Francis Galton discovered in the 19th century .
He was the son of Charles Darwin &apos;s cousin .
He pointed out that there were some people , who were very unusual , had this particular trait — every time they saw a number that was ours .
Five blue , seven yellow , eight green , nine pounds , OK ?
Consider , these people are very natural in other ways .
Or a sharp C note . Sometimes the pitches make color .
Bluefin C , blue sharp F tune , green , another one might be yellow , OK ?
Why is this happening ?
This is called Sinnesia — Galton called it Sinnesisia , mixing senses .
In each of us , senses are separated .
In these senses , they &apos;re confused .
Why is that happening ?
One of the sides of this dilemma is very interesting .
The Chinese are in the families , and this is how Juston said that this has a genetic basis , a genetic basis .
Secondly , the Sinnesian is about — and this is what brings me to what I want to point out about the main subject of this talk , which is about creativity — the Sinnesians are eight times more spread in artists , poets , parents and other innovators than the rest of the public .
Why is that ?
I &apos;ll answer that question .
I &apos;ve never answered it before .
Well , what is the synesthesia ? What causes it ?
Well , there are many theories .
One of the theories is that they &apos;re just nuts .
Now this is not really a scientific theory that we can forget .
Another theory is they &apos;re busy and drug addicts , right ?
Now , there may be some health in this because this is more spread here in the Bay area in San Diego .
( Laughter ) Okay . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in the Sinnesia ? Okay ?
We found that the colors and the numbers zones next to each other in the brain , in the boiling light .
We said there &apos;s some racial rivalry between color and numbers in the brain .
So every time you see a number , you see a horizontal color , and that &apos;s why you get Sinnesia .
Now remember — why is that happening ?
Why are there global warming in some people ?
Remember I said it was in the families ?
That gives you an idea .
And that is that there is an unnatural gene , a mutation in that gene , that causes this unnatural dress .
In each of us , it turns out , we &apos;re born with everything else .
Every region in the brain is connected to every other region , and these are encouraging to create the distinctive structure of the larger brain .
If there &apos;s a gene that causes this torture , and if you turn this gene around , you get a decline between the areas of the brain that are affected .
And if it &apos;s between numbers and colors , it &apos;s going to get a little bit simpler than numbers and colors .
And if it &apos;s between the notes and the colors , it &apos;s going to get simpler the notes and the colors .
So far , good .
Now what if this gene is shown everywhere in the brain , so everything is clogged ?
Well , you think of what artists share , parents and poets , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking to ideas that don &apos;t have to do with them apparently , like , &quot; &quot; This East , Juliet is the sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say Juliet is the sun — does that mean it &apos;s a radioactive ball ?
I mean , mental designers say that , but that &apos;s a different story , right ?
The ordinary people say it &apos;s warm like the sun , it &apos;s dumb like the sun , it &apos;s sheer like the sun .
You immediately find relationships .
Now , if you assume that this network and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , this will result in a much larger metric into metaphorical thinking and creativity in the people with Sennesian .
And so , there are eight times the case of the Sennesian among poets , artists and parents .
Well — it &apos;s a very brainstorming view of the Newtonian .
The last slide — can I take a minute ?
( Applause ) All right . Now I &apos;m going to show you all that you &apos;re going to be a Sinnesian , but you &apos;re very convinced of that .
This is what I call the historical alphabet , like your alphabet , 1,000 are epidemic , Jim is Jim .
Different forms of different sounds , OK ?
Here you have the Martian alphabet .
One is Kiki , one of them is Bob .
Which is Kiki and who are Boba ?
How many of you think this is Kiki and that Pope ? Raise your hands .
Well , there &apos;s a copy or two .
( Laughter ) How many of you think this is Puba , tick ? Raise your hand .
Ninety-nine percent of you .
Well , none of you from Mars , how did you know that ?
Because all of you use a model — the synesthetic abstraction — in a sense , you say that that sharp needle , Kiki , in the auditory cortex , the sentient cells are perplexed , Kiki , simulating the visual tight — the surprise tiger — so the old form .
This is very important now , because what it tells you is that your brain is busy in something primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a ridiculous illusion , but those photons in your eyes form this shape , and hairstyles in your ear are influencing the auditory pattern , but the brain can extract the common thing .
It &apos;s a primitive kind of abstraction , and we now know that this is happening in the central brain because when it &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Kiki Bob , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
If you ask this guy , what ? &quot; &quot; Not all he &apos;s listening to , &quot; &quot; What does that mean ? The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well if it &apos;s a reputation metal , that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s from gold .
You have to measure its specific trust , OK ? So these lose the whole metaphor .
This area is about eight times bigger in the highest in humans , than in the apes .
Something very interesting is happening here in the vascular spectrum because it &apos;s a crossroads between hearing , vision , touch and becoming huge in humans — and something interesting is happening .
And I think it &apos;s the basis for a lot of human capabilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
All of these questions that philosophers have asked over the centuries , we scientists can start looking at it by visualizing the brain and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry about that .
( Laughter )
This is a story about taking the imagination seriously .
Fourteen years ago , I met natural materials , the problem of hunting networks , which are the same ones that have been used for centuries .
Today , I use it to create permanent , permanent forms of buildings in cities around the world .
In fact , I &apos;m not the qualified person .
I didn &apos;t study the sculpture industry , civil engineering , not architecture .
In fact , after my college degree , I gave students access to seven art schools , and I was rejected by seven .
So I used to myself to continue my art career , and I painted for about 10 years , and one day I had a trip to India .
I promised to do a few exhibitions for my sculptures , and I sent the paintings to shipping , and I went to Mahabharm .
The gallery came in , and the paintings didn &apos;t get there .
And I had to offer something .
And that hunter-gatherer village was famous for artistic objects .
So I tried to use bronze to make one .
But it was difficult and expensive and expensive .
So I took a walk on the beach , and I had to find an idea , and I was watching fishermen dragging their fishermen into the sand beach .
I saw that scene probably every day there , but that time it was different , I had a new idea of making skull objects without using heavy materials .
My first project was &quot; &quot; The Principle &quot; &quot; made with the help of these hunters .
It &apos;s a body that expresses itself , which is called &quot; &quot; Extraordinary Development Goals . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I put it on columns to photograph it .
And I found out how flexible and soft it is , how it responds to every single person who is air and is identical .
I was fascinated by it .
I continued to study the letter in collaboration with designers in Tanzania and the Danish manufacturer .
I loved the little details . I gave my work a little bit , but I wanted to make bigger objects , and I wanted to move from something that you &apos;re looking at is lost in its food .
Going back to India to work with fishermen , we first made a network of a million and a half million handcuffs that were built in Madrid for a while .
And thousands of them watched it as a city planner called Manuel Sula Mordon , and he designed a marine facade in Portto . Portugal .
And he asked me if I could build this as a permanent model of the city .
I didn &apos;t know if that was possible to present my art .
In a permanent engineer , it &apos;s the opposite of the characteristics that exist in my weak soft skies .
For two years , I looked for a kind of canvas that could reach out in front of the ultraviolet radiation , saltwater moisture and pollution , and at the same time it would be rare enough to move safely with the wind .
And we needed something to be attached to the network in the middle of my trajectory .
If we raise a 35,000 pounds .
And it was designed to move very acceptable within the boundary , to reach out in front of the hurricane wind .
But there was no computer program that could generate a model for something that was moving , and at the same time , the web .
I met an amazing flying engineer who was designed by the U.S.-Shark Company named Better Hill .
And it helped me go beyond these two specific acknowledges and flexible motion .
This object cannot be built in my usual way by connecting the contract by hand , it will not reach the hurricane .
So we &apos;ve created a way of collaborating with fisheries and depending on their various machines , we &apos;ve been able to come up with a way that we can use them in the body industry .
And there was no way to transfer the strange old porch into a new product machine .
So we created a new machine .
And after three years of work , two children , we were able to create a network with 50,000 square meters .
It was hard to believe that what I imagined was built now , and it was always a skull without losing anything from the last April and transferring the process to modern machines .
( Applause ) The circulation was anonymous and ended .
But now it &apos;s become a teacher .
I walked down the object for the first time .
I saw the wind tunnel in its strings , and I felt safe , and at the same time I felt connected to the extended sky .
Since then , my life has changed .
I wanted to create these objects in cities around the world .
And I &apos;m going to share with you two of them , and they &apos;re the newest makers of my work .
Here in the history hall in the city of Philadelphia , it &apos;s a public square , I felt obsessed with using more material than the web of hunting .
We did an experiment with small molecules of water to create a dry rat that formed from the wind , and in the test we found that it could form dry melting and interacting with people without engaging .
And I used this technique to create a object that tracks the subway lines on the ground for a moment , and it &apos;s like an X-ray of the landlines .
The next challenge was in Pennial in Denver in America , and I was asked to offer a model of 35 Western countries in one object .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know how to start with it , but I said yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes ,
I read about the land awe that had recently hit Chile and how the tsunami wave spread across the entire Atlantic Ocean .
And it changed the state of the tectonic paintings that speeded the globe and shorter than today .
So I called the National Ocean and the atmosphere , and I asked them to share the tsunami information , and I turned it into this form .
It &apos;s called 1.26 , it &apos;s the number of clicks per second microRNAs that we have today on Earth .
You couldn &apos;t build this object with a city ring .
Because the shape was very complicated .
So I replaced the iron with a complex and soft type of cloth , which is 15 times stronger than steel .
The object now becomes soft and flexible , and it can be tied up with the building , and it literally becomes part of the entire city tissue .
There was no program that could isolate and study all these complex networks and shape them and study them on Earth &apos;s gravity .
So we made a program for that purpose .
And then someone in New York called me and asked if this could be applied to Time Square , or in highways .
And soft objects can form these things and build these objects that are the size of skyscrapers .
They don &apos;t have the funding yet , but I have the dream that my son is building models like these in cities around the world in the places you need them .
Fourteen years ago , I was looking for beauty in the tradition of hand .
Now , I &apos;m combining high-tech materials and engineering to make very interesting shapes with a very large scale , like the size of buildings .
The range of art is expanding .
And I &apos;ll close with this story .
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
He says that a lawyer in the office doesn &apos;t care about art at all , and he never visited an artistic day , and he insisted that everybody would come down from the building and get out and stay down in this object .
They received their official champions on the grass to watch the body respond to the air systems next to people who might not know them to participate together to rediscover the wonders of the universe .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to understand this slide is to look at the horizontal axis of your age .
At some point after puberty , we get to the minimum level on the map .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
When I was a kid .
This was my team .
( Laughter ) I cared about sports .
I didn &apos;t want to play or watch them .
What I wanted to do , I wanted to hunt .
I grew up in my country hunting on the beaches of Connecticut , and these are the creatures I saw on a regular basis .
But after I got to college , after I got home in the early &apos; 90s , this is what I found .
My team has shrunk .
It &apos;s like having a list that &apos;s literally destroyed .
And as I said , who looked forward to that , from my point of view as a fisherman , began a kind of knowledge , well , how was the rest of the world thinking about this ?
I first looked at the fish markets .
And when I went to it , and despite where I was , whether I was in North Carolina , Paris or London , I kept seeing a four-species weird , over and over again , on the menu of food , on the ice , my shrimp , tuna , salmon and cod fish .
I think this is very strange , and when I was looking at them , I was wondering , did anybody notice this shirt in the size of the market ?
When I looked at that , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team .
The ordinary people , their equipment in marine food was like this .
It &apos;s not a human trait that is so extraordinary to limit the natural world down to the minimum of elements .
We did this before , 10,000 years ago , when we came out .
If you look at the fire fossils from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see the coon , the wolves , you &apos;ll see all different species of creatures .
And if you look 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
Birds too .
If you look at the lists in the New York City restaurant 150 to 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see penguins , Duke , chicken and dozens of ducks .
And if you look at the telescope at the age of modern animals , you &apos;ll see four : Roman religion , duck , chicken and bananas .
So it makes sense to go in this direction .
But how did we go in this direction ?
Okay ...
First of all , that &apos;s a new problem .
That &apos;s how we hunt from the oceans 50 years ago .
The Second World War was a tremendous motivation to allow ourselves .
All the technologies that we &apos;ve created during the Second World War , the Supermarket , the polymers are lightweight , all of these things are redirected towards fish .
And so you see this massive crowd in fishing capabilities , four times in the course of time , from the end of World War II to the present time .
That means we extract between 80 to 90 million tons of tuna .
That &apos;s the equivalent of the human weight in China coming out of the sea every year .
It &apos;s not coincidentally that we use China for example because China is the largest nation in the world .
That &apos;s half the story .
The other half is that there &apos;s an incredible pit in raising fish and raising aquatic neighborhoods , only in the last year or two , the wild fish are starting to cross the wild that we &apos;re producing .
So if you add wildfish and farmed fish together , you can get the equivalent of two species of the ocean every year .
And again , it &apos;s not coincidentally that we use China as the largest fisherman fisherman , and it &apos;s also the largest fish farmer .
So let &apos;s look through the four choices .
Number one : Until now , the most consumering seafood in shrimp America .
The shrimp are a terrible product .
Five , 10 , 15 pounds of wild fish are systematically killing one embryo of shrimp into the market .
It &apos;s also an inefficient fuel in markets .
In a recent study that came out of Daisozy University , they found that shrimp are one of the most dense carbonate you can hunt .
So they could grow them , and indeed people would implant them , and they would grow a lot of them .
The problem is .
The places where shrimp farming is in the wild in the mangrove forest .
Look at these isolated roots .
Those are the things that connect soil together , protect coastal , and create habitats for all kinds of small fish and shrimp all kinds of things that are important for this environment .
Well , this is what happens to a lot of coastal forest .
We &apos;ve lost millions of coastal mangroves over 30 or 40 years .
This rate has slowed down , but we still have a huge deficit in the mangrove .
And the other thing here is the phenomenon of the filmmaker Mark Benjamin filmmaker called &quot; The melody . &quot; &quot; This phenomenon is very connected to something that you &apos;ve never seen on the tropics .
Because what &apos;s happening now , we have draglines of shrimp , hunting a huge amount of it , what happens is that the Arab fishing in turn turns into shrimp food .
And sometimes , a lot of these ships work with slaves and they &apos;re hunted for what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; garbage fish . &quot; &quot; The fish that we like to see in the coral reefs , they grind them and convert them into a shrimp box , an ecosystem that literally eats itself and spits shrimp .
Next is one of the most consumering seafood in America , and also across the West , tuna .
Even the tuna of these global fish eventually .
It has to be managed in order to run well .
In our administrative area , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the regional Organization of Fish fisheries , &quot; &quot; and it forgets the acronym of ICAT , the International Commission to keep tuna in the Atlantic .
The great medical scientist Carl Savana once called him , &quot; The International Convention to hunt all the tuna fish . &quot;
Of course we &apos;ve seen an incredible improvement in ICAT in the last few years , there &apos;s an area of improvement , but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish , and to control it for us to control the world .
You can also raise tuna , but the tuna is incredibly bad for fish farms .
Many don &apos;t know that , but the tuna of warm blood .
TED can temperature it by 20 degrees above the room temperature , it can swim at 40 miles an hour .
That &apos;s a lot of the benefits of farming fish , right ?
Fish farmed from cold blood that don &apos;t move much .
And that &apos;s a good thing to increase the protein in .
But if you get this crazy , wild creature swimming at 40 miles an hour and smoking it , it &apos;s not a candidate to grow it fish .
The next creature is the most consumer-based marine food in America and all the way to the Southern West .
Now salmon happens to it , too , but it doesn &apos;t have to happen by fishing .
That &apos;s my birth of Connecticut .
Connecticut is a lot of salmon .
But if you look at the state map , every point is a cord .
There are over 3,000 pounds in the state .
And I always say that &apos;s why people in the state are so nervous — ( Laughter ) if someone can just release Chi Connecticut , I feel that we can become a much better world .
But I made this comment in the NIH agreement , and this man from North Carolina , says , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s hard not to be in Connecticut , because we have here in North Carolina 35,000 families that are a national epidemic , it &apos;s a global pandemic .
There are dams everywhere , and these are exactly the things that prevent salmon from getting to reproduction zones .
And as a result , we have to grow them fish , and salmon has been successful for several points .
When I first started planting salmon fish , it could take about six pounds of wild fish to make one pound of salmon .
The industry has improved a lot .
It &apos;s got two to one , although there &apos;s a little cheating , because if you look at the way the fish farms are produced , they measure the batteries per pound of salmon .
Those batteries start to decrease the fish .
So what happens — what &apos;s called FIFO , the fish is internal and a fish out — it &apos;s hard to say .
But anyway , the pride of this industry has declined the amount of fish per pound of salmon .
The problem goes crazy with the amount of salmon produced .
Fish farms are the fastest food system growing on Earth .
It grows by seven percent a year .
Despite the few fish in the markets , we still kill small fish .
Not just fish , but what we feed fish , we feed fish for chicken and pigs .
We get a chicken feeding on fish , and strangely , fish feeding on chicken .
Because chickens , blood and bones feed fish .
I &apos;ve always wondered , is there a fish eating a chicken feeding on a fish ?
It &apos;s kind of a reframing between the chicken and the egg . ( Laughter ) All of that together , although it leads to a terrible mess .
What are we talking about ? It &apos;s something between 20 to 30 million tons of wild species that we extract from the ocean and use .
That &apos;s the equivalent of a third of China , or the entire United States of humans coming out of the sea every year .
The last four species .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; White Fish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish being turned into the white fish , but the way to know the story , I think , through this classic piece of American diamonds , we &apos;re going to sandwiches .
The elephant sandwiches started from the spider fish .
And I started with the local privilege that found that when he served in McDonald on Friday , no one came .
Because it was a Catholic society , he needed fish .
He even went to Ray Cruck and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get you a fish sandwich , it &apos;s going to be made of a spider fish .
Ray Cruck said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work .
I want to make Hula Berger , and there &apos;s going to be a slice of people on the cake .
But let &apos;s do it for a moment .
It &apos;s going to sell more and it &apos;s going to be the winner . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s sad for the oceans that Hula Berger didn &apos;t work .
So he made a robot sandwich .
Unfortunately , the sandwich came 30 cents .
Ray 25 cents wanted it , so I turned to the Atlantic .
We all know what happened to the Atlantic cod in New England .
And so far Sandwich filia is made from Pollock Alaska , it &apos;s one of the largest violent fish in the United States , extracting from two to three million of the sea every year .
If we go through Pollock , the next option is probably the covering .
Planet of those fish that he hadn &apos;t heard of 20 years ago .
It &apos;s actually a very efficient conversion of plant proteins in the animal that &apos;s a gift from the sky to the Third World .
In fact , it &apos;s a sustainable solution , it turns out of egg to get to nine months .
And the problem is that when we look at the West , it doesn &apos;t do what the West wants to do .
It &apos;s really not something called an oil profile .
It doesn &apos;t have EPA and DHA Omega-3S that we all think we &apos;re going to make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean the first thing about spines ?
Fish that represents the biggest part of 20 to 30 million tons .
Well , one possibility that many environmental protectors have influenced , can we eat them ?
Can we eat it instead of feeding it to the salmon ?
There &apos;s a argument for that .
They form a huge efficiency in fuel consumption to put it into the market , a small portion of the cost of shrimp fuel , and on top of the carbon efficiency scale .
It &apos;s also rich in Omega 3 , a big source of EPA and DHA .
So this is probably the case .
And if we were to go down this road , what I would say is , instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a few dollars a ton , and make it a watersheet , we could reduce fishing and double the price of hunters and make it our way to treat these fish with their own ?
Another possibility through , and it &apos;s very interesting , we look at the two shocks , particularly the sea salt .
The sea salt has a high level of EPA and DHA , similar to the colored tuna .
It &apos;s also efficient fuel .
To bring a pound of seaweed to markets about one to 30 percent of carbon as it is required to make cowboy meat .
Because you don &apos;t need fish sheet , you actually get Omega-3S through water filters .
This is where Omega 3S comes from , it doesn &apos;t come from fish .
The algae made Omega-3 only biodegradable in the fish .
The seaweed and the soft water purifies enormous amounts of water .
One sea slate can filter tens of gallons a day .
And this is very important when we look at the world .
Now , the bottle , the overuse of phosphorus in the waterways causing a massive breeding of algae .
More than 400 new dead areas have been created in the last 20 years , enormous sources of marine life .
We also can &apos;t look at fish at all .
We can look at vegetables .
We can look at the seaweed , all these different kinds of things that can be rich in Omega-3S , proteins , of very good things as well .
It filters the water just like a sea salt .
It turns out that they can feed to cows .
I &apos;m not a big fan of cattle .
But if you want to keep cattle increasing in time and space where water resources are limited , more algae in the water , you don &apos;t have to maintain it , a major consideration .
And the last fish are an understanding mark .
We have the ability to raise farmfish that will provide us the protein .
That this creature has to be my plant , it grows very quickly , adaptable to climate change and it has fish that have that EPA , DHA , Omega-3 acids that we &apos;re looking for .
And this kind of paper is there .
These subjects have been reported for 15 years .
Every time someone tells me , &quot; &quot; We can do all this . We can do it . We know how to do it .
We can produce this fish that won a seawater protein that contains Omega3S . &quot; &quot; Great .
But it &apos;s not expanding its range .
It &apos;s time to expand its range .
If we do , 30 million metric tons of marine food , one third of the world &apos;s fishing , it will stay in water .
So I think what I &apos;m saying is this is what we can go through .
We tend to go with our appetite instead of our minds .
But if we go along with this , or some numbers from that , we might have a little more of this .
Thank you .
( Applause )
It became exactly like the fetus in the womb of his mother .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it turns out that the two billion are totally separate from each other .
Excuse me . Thank you . It was fun . ( Help : It was already . )
Information , in a form of energy , flows directly through all of our sensory systems and then explodes into this enormous poster of what this present moment looks like , as well as smell , and the food at the moment with what it feels like and what it looks like .
I &apos;m an energy organism that &apos;s connected to the energy that &apos;s around me through my own perception of the right-hand sphere .
And at this moment , we &apos;re in perfect state and we achieve the concept of beauty .
The left brain is a very different place .
Half the left brain is thinking linear and systemic .
And the left brain is thinking about language .
And all I can observe is that energy — energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ?
And I felt so light in my body . And imagine .
