By the end of the year , there will be almost a billion people on a planet using social media sites .
The one thing they all have in common is they will die .
While this may be a bit of a morbid thought , I think it has significant implications worth exploring .
Now what got me started thinking about this was a blog record that was written earlier this year by Derek Kepler , who was a science journalist and a technology that died of cancer .
And what Miller did was he asked his family and his friends to write a post that came out a little after his crime .
Here &apos;s what he wrote to start this .
He said , &quot; &quot; There it is . I die and this is my last post in blog .
Earlier , I asked that when my body finally turned out to be my cancer punishment , so my family and friends would publish the predetermined message that I wrote — the first step of the process of turning it from an active site to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while I was a journalist , Archive Miller might have written better and edited better than most , actually all of us today create an archive that is completely different from anything that was created by the previous generation .
Take a look at some statistics for a moment .
There are now 48 hours of video on YouTube every minute .
There are 200 million Twitter messages written every day .
And the average Facebook user makes 90 pieces of content every month .
So when you think about your parents or around you , at best they &apos;ve created some images or films , or a journal that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we create this rich digital component that &apos;s going to live in the cloud forever , years after we die .
And I think it &apos;s going to create some very interesting opportunities for technologies .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a non-technologist journalist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future will look like .
Now we already see some services designed to allow us to decide what will happen to our online profile and our media accounts after we die .
One of them actually , appropriately , found me when I went into a restaurant in New York City , in Porocquare .
( Audio ) Adam Austrio : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
EU : Yeah .
Death : Death can catch you everywhere , at any time , even in my organism .
EU : Who is that ?
Death : go to the ididiot net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Austrio : Pretty frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
So what the service does , quite simply , is to allow you to create a message or a video that will spread to Facebook after your death .
Another service now is called 1,000 memories .
And what this allows you is to create online diabetes to your loved ones , with film pictures and stories that they can come up after your death .
But what I think comes next is much more interesting .
Now many of you probably know Dave Roy , March , showed how he could analyze over 90,000 hours of household video .
I think that as the machine capabilities to understand human language and process huge amounts of data continue to improve it will become possible to analyze entire life content of a human — the watts , the images , the movies , the blog posts — that we produce in such huge amounts of content .
And I think when that happens , it will be possible for our digital personality to continue interacting with the real world much after we are supporting the vast amount of information that we &apos;ve created and the ability of technology to understand it .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
In a service called my next tweet looking at all your tweets , everything you wrote on Twitter , to make some predictions of what we would write next .
So now , as you can see , the results can be quite local .
You can imagine what something like this will look like in five , 10 , 20 years when our technologies will improve .
If we take this one step further , the MIT Media Lab works on robots that can communicate more like people .
But what if these robots were able to communicate on a unique basis of a particular person based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of information that this person had created in his life ?
Finally , think of this famous scene in the West election of 2008 in the United States , where CNN broadcast a live hologram of the hip-hop artist Wyl Ei into their studio with Anderson Cooper .
What if we could use the same technology to launch a representation of our loved ones into our living room — and communicate in a very realistic way based on all the content they created while they were alive .
I think it will become fully possible when the amount of information that we use and the technological ability to understand will expand exponentially .
Now finally , I think what we all need to think about is whether we want to become our reality — and if so what that means to define life and everything that comes after that .
Thank you very much .

People who come back to work after a break in reading — I call them remotivation .
They &apos;re very similar to others experiencing beyond : military veterans , veterans , people who have retired from retirement or people who come back from living abroad .
It &apos;s hard to go back to work after a break because of a disconnect between the employers and the revention .
Prisons might think that recruiting people with &quot; &quot; hole &quot; &quot; in the literature is a dangerous move , and people in career break might question their ability to restore their career , especially if they didn &apos;t work a long time .
This disconnect is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Repower that have been successful is everywhere and in every field .
This is Sami Kapala .
He &apos;s a British nuclear physicist who took five years of break to be at home with his five children .
The media in Singapore recently wrote about nurses coming back to work after long career break .
And if you talk about long breaks , this is Miami Chan .
She &apos;s a social worker from Orange County in California , who went back to work as a social worker after 25 years of break .
This is the longest career break I know .
The Supreme Court judge Sandra Equor took five years of break early in her career .
And this is Traie Shiro , who took a 13-year break .
Tracey did what most of us do when we feel we had a good day looking for work .
She was looking for a role in finance or accountability management and she spent the last nine months checking companies online , asking for work requests , but no results .
I met Tracy in June 2011 , when the program asked me to work with her to see if I could help her .
Watch this , and don &apos;t worry about it .
There will be a handful of suggestions that will ultimately lead to a busy opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tracy , but I want to share with you a discovery that I discovered when I went back to work after a career break 11 years old .
And that , in other words , is your image frozen in time .
There &apos;s one thing that I remember very clearly from my private career break .
I believe that remotors are the product of the workforce , and that &apos;s why .
We &apos;ve done it already .
We have fewer partner radiologists .
We &apos;re more inhabited in life .
We have beauty of working experience .
We have a older perspective .
We &apos;re not looking for ourselves at the expense of the employer .
And we also have energy , and the enthusiasm to go back to work because we were dragged from it to the period .
On the other side , I &apos;m talking to employers and there are two concerns that have to do with the deal of remotivation .
The first is , employers worry that remotors will not be technologically updated .
My financial report I wrote so long ago , I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
I don &apos;t even know if anyone remembers so far , but I had to relearn it on Excel .
It was actually not that hard , a lot of commands are the same .
I tell all the remotors that the employers expect them to come to the office with practical knowledge in the ocean .
And if they &apos;re not updated , it &apos;s their responsibility to update .
And they do it .
This is the responsibility of the recurring workers to show the employer where they can contribute most .
In 2010 , I noticed something .
I saw an engineer coming back , an uncharacteristic repeat candidate , serving candidates for the military specialty , and then getting a permanent job there .
Think how far we &apos;ve gone .
Before that , most employers were not interested in working with revention .
Different pool , same idea .
So I &apos;m going to tell you what happened to Tracy Shiro .
Fast forward to 2015 , a previous trivial .
They funded her to graduate school for MBA .
She even hired another revention that would work for her .
Now , my goal is to bring the idea of rewards to work for more and more employers .

Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar technology industry .
And my little bank is interested in imposing ourselves on the environment by requiring attention ...
Heart attention to mass planning .
It &apos;s just a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
Ha . Wait a minute .
It will take a moment to go up .
( Laughter ) Well maybe — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip the video ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) It &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The solar technology is ...
Am I out of time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .

This was the afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I worked at the American Civil Rights Association as the Organization of Science Council .
I really , I really loved my job , but I had one of these days where I felt a little bit despair .
So I went down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
Chris was on ACLU for over 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge and insight .
I explained to Chris that I feel a little bit stuck .
I &apos;ve been studying a number of issues at the intersection between science and civil rights — super interesting .
But I wanted the ACLU to work on these issues in a much broader way , in a way that could really make a difference .
So Chris cut straight and interested , and he said , &quot; Well , of all the issues you look at , what are the first five ? &quot;
Oh , and of course , there are patents on genes . &quot; &quot; &quot; genes patents ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You tell me that the United States government put patents on some of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be true . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came in a storm for my office .
&quot; Oh my God ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we prosecute ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Chris is a brilliant lawyer , but he almost knew nothing about the law of patents and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , and certainly not a patent lawyer .
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could make a lawsuit .
First of all , we had to understand exactly what was registered in the patent when someone registered a patent garden .
Patents on genes usually contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial stores are the ones called isolated DNA — that is , some of the DNA that &apos;s separated from the cell .
And the patents weren &apos;t just a gene that they were isolated , but on any possible version of this gene .
So what does that mean ?
That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to the doctor and ask her to look at it , for example , see if it has any mutations , without the permission of the patent holder .
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using this gene in research or clinical trials .
To enable patent holders , often private companies , to lock parts of the human genome hurt patients .
Think about an age , 10 years old with long QT syndrome , a severe heart condition , that if not treated , can end up with sudden death .
The company that held the patent on two genes associated with the situation developed a test to diagnose the syndrome .
But then they flew a leg and they never offered it .
So another lab was trying to offer the test , but the company that held patents had threatened to prosecute the lab on patent violation .
So as a result , for two years , no exam was available .
Patents on genes are a problem clearly and vulnerable to patients .
But is there a way that we can read about it ?
It turns out the Supreme Court has made a long line of cases , that some things don &apos;t deserve to be registered as a patent .
You can &apos;t patent nature &apos;s products — air , water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t patent nature &apos;s laws — gravity laws , E = mc2 .
These things are just too basic and have to stay free to everyone and not be reserved to anyone .
We think that DNA , the basic structure of life , which encode for the production of all our proteins , is both the product of nature and the law of nature , no matter whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting at the bottom of a observation .
When we got interested in this , we traveled around the country to talk to a lot of different specialists — scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we were right in terms of policy , and at least in theory , in terms of law .
Why is that ?
So , the patent office registered these patents for over 20 years .
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
The patent committee was deep inside the status quo , the biotechnology industry was growing around this issue , and legislation to ban patents on genes was shown year after year in Congress , and went nowhere .
So the bottom line : courts just won &apos;t be willing to drop those patents down .
Now , not Chris and I weren &apos;t the kind of guy who got rid of the challenge , and to hear , &quot; &quot; Being right is just not enough , &quot; &quot; seems like another reason to fight this battle .
So we had to build our case .
Now , patent cases tend to be : A company A suits society B for some small , insignificant technical thing .
So we decided we were going to develop a case that wasn &apos;t like the typical patent records — more like a citizen rights case .
We used to recognize a patent of a gene that forced his patents in the algae and then organize a wide coalition of prosecutors and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents hurt patients and innovations .
We found the main candidate for the magazine at Myriad Jentax , a company located in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Miriad held patents on two genes , the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 .
Women with certain mutations throughout these genes are considered a significant risk of developing breast cancer and disease .
Miriad used these patents to maintain an entire monopoly on the BRCA test in the United States .
They forced many laboratories offered a BRCA test to stop .
The company has raised a lot of money on the test — over 3,000 dollars .
They stopped sharing their clinical data with the international scientific community .
And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , Myriad refused to update their test to include additional mutations identified by a team of researchers in France .
It was estimated that during this period , for a few years , up to 12 percent of the women who had passed the test had a wrong answer — a negative test result that had to be positive .
This is Celine McChan .
Celine &apos;s sister , Eileen , developed breast cancer at the age of 40 and she was tested by Miriad .
The test was negative .
The family felt relief .
That means that Ailyn &apos;s cancer probably didn &apos;t go through the family , and that the other family members didn &apos;t have to be tested .
But two years later , Celine was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer .
If Eileen would get the correct result , Celine would have been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been avoided .
Once we decided about Miriad , then we had to create a coalition of prosecutors and experts that could illuminate these problems .
We finished with 20 very committed prosecutors : genetic advisers , geneticists who got contraceptives , cigarettes , four great scientific organizations that would cooperate more than 150,000 scientists and professional health professionals , and private women who either couldn &apos;t afford the test of Miriad , or wanted to have secondary opinions and couldn &apos;t , as a result of the patents .
One of the great challenges we had in making the case was to figure out what the better way to get science done .
So to make sure that what Miriad did was not an invention , and that isolated genes of BRCA were the products of nature , we had to explain two basic concepts , like : What is a gene ? What is DNA ?
How do you isolate DNA ? And why isn &apos;t it an invention ?
We spent hours and hours with our professionals and experts , trying to find ways to explain these concepts simply but exactly .
And we ended up heavily dependent on using metaphors , like gold .
So DNA isolation — it &apos;s like a fast gold sandwich or its expenditure from a stream .
You might patent the process of mining the gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
It might take a lot of hard work and effort to dig and get the gold out of the mountain ; you can &apos;t register the patent , it &apos;s still gold .
So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to highlight our lawsuit .
We served at the Federal Court in the southern province of New York , and the case was randomly removed to Judge Robert Sevitt .
In March 2010 , the judge Sevitt published his mind — 152 pages — and a complete triumph to our side .
In reading the opinion , we couldn &apos;t overcome what furniture he described science in this lawsuit .
I mean , our harvest — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this thing in such a short time ?
We just couldn &apos;t figure out how it happened .
So it turns out , the officer of the judge Sevitt who worked with him at the time , was not just a lawyer — he was a scientist .
He wasn &apos;t just a scientist — he had a Ph.D. in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What an amazing luck !
Miriad then was arrested for the US Federal Court .
And this is where things really got interesting .
First of all , at a very disturbing moment in the bag , the U.S. government switched side .
So in the County Court , the government took a legal harvest on the side of Miriad .
But now , in complete contrast to her patent office , the United States government has come up with a harvesting that indicates that the government has reexamined the issue with the opinion of the district court , and it has come to the conclusion that isolated DNA is not registered as a patent .
It was really a big , totally unexpected thing .
The federal youth court hears all the patent records , and it has a reputation of being very , very much for patents .
So even with this extraordinary development , we expected to lose .
And we lost .
About it .
The final decision was split , two to one .
But the two judges that stopped us , did it for completely different reasons .
The first one , the judge Laurie , built himself a original biological theory — completely wrong .
( Laughter ) He decided that Miriad created a new chemical — completely irrational .
Miriad didn &apos;t even claim it , so it was very surprising .
The second , the judge Moore , said that she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
But she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to take the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; Third , the judge Brillison , agreed with us .
So now we &apos;ve been looking for surveys by the Supreme Court .
And when you leave the Supreme Court , you have to present a question that you want the court to answer .
Usually these questions perceive a form of super-long paragraph , something like a whole length of a whole page with a lot of paragraphs , &quot; &quot; which paragraph here and &quot; &quot; appa &quot; &quot; there .
We may have come up with the shortest question ever asked .
Four words : human genes are patented ?
I want judges to have exactly the same reaction that I had when I came up with this thing from me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with it .
The Supreme Court only hears one percent of all the lawsuits he gets , and he agreed to hear our own .
Two organizations of breast cancer , Action against breast cancer and FORCE , we organized a protest on the staircase of court .
Chris and I sat still in the hallway , moments before he was supposed to go in and claim the most important argument in his career .
I was clearly more nervous than him .
The argument itself was fascinating .
Chris argued brilliantly .
The judge Cagan compared isolated DNA to the take of a healing plant from the Amazon .
The judge Roberts looked at this from a wooden baseball goddess .
And in one of my very favorite moments , the judge Sotomer declared that DNA isolated is &quot; &quot; simply nature sits there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident in ourselves when we left the courtroom that day , but I would never have predicted the result : nine versus zero .
DNA fragmentation that naturally appears is a product of nature , and you can &apos;t register a patent just because it &apos;s lonely .
And yet , Miriad did nothing . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five laboratories announced that they would start offering BRCA tests .
Some of them promised to offer the test at a lower cost than Myriad .
Some promised to provide a more inclusive test than the ones that Miriad offers .
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
It ends a 25-year driver of allowing patent regimes on human genes in the United States .
It downloads a significant obstacle to discovery and invention in biomedicine .
And it helps to ensure that patients like Abil , Celine and Ilin will have access to the tests they need .
Number two weeks after the court published his decision , I got a little package in mail .
She was a Cock-Diagan , a professor at Duke University and one of the first people that Chris and I went to visit when we started considering whether to take this case .
I opened it up to see a little animal doll .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk when we took this bag .
Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was that we knew we were doing the right thing .
It took almost eight years from the beginning to the end , with a lot of plans and changes along the way .
It was a little lucky enough to help , but it was the communities that we grew up in between , the alliances that we created , that allowed pigs to fly .
Thank you .

The second quotation is the mouth of a head .
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
And then you can make predictions and test them .
What do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is really greater than the sum of its parts .
Where are the economic networks ?
What we &apos;ve looked at in detail is ownership networks .
And we also value every society .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies that operate more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
Let me explain with this example .
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you to a wingspots about eight of my projects , which have been collaborated with the Danny Surn Porse artist .
We call ourselves Force &amp; Ro , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , called &quot; &quot; The Uncle Telephone . &quot; &quot; And his inspiration came from my uncle &apos;s strange foot to ask me without a break to do things for him , almost as if I was the sequel of his body — turn on the lights or bring him a glass of water , a cigarette box .
And as I grew up , it got worse and worse , and I started thinking about it as a kind of control .
But of course , I couldn &apos;t never tell anything , because David is a respected figure in Indian family .
And the situation that got me upset and amazed me most was his use on a linear phone .
He would hold the tube and expect me to smile the number for him .
So in response and preparation for my uncle , I created the &quot; &quot; Uncle phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it takes two people to use .
That &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone designed for one person .
But the problem is , when I left home and went to college , I started to miss his commands .
So I created a loving writing machine through which it can break its functions into nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the machine , print the email or the command and and pull the paper out .
This device was automatically sending the person to record the letter as an email .
So here you can see , we &apos;ve embedded a lot of electronics that understand all the mechanical actions and convert them into digital .
So my uncle is only dealing with mechanical interface .
And of course , the object had to be very large and have a sense of rituality , the way my uncle loves it .
The next job is a sensitive installation to a voice that we call &quot; &quot; the scaffolding . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with an idea of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So how this works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures hidden .
Once there &apos;s silence , they kind of crawl out .
And if it &apos;s even more quiet , they extend their necks out .
And the smallest sound , they hide again .
So we had these panels on three walls in the room .
And we had over 500 of these little scaffolding hidden behind them .
So that &apos;s how it works .
This is a prototype movie .
So when silence , they kind of go out behind the panels .
And they hear as people hear , or like real creatures .
So they become immune to sounds that separate them after some time .
And they don &apos;t respond to background voices .
You &apos;ll hear a train in a moment that they don &apos;t respond to .
( Noises ) But they respond to sound in the front , you &apos;ll hear it in a second .
( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as much lives as possible .
So each scaffold has its behavior , psychology , mood states , personality and so on .
So this is a very first prototype .
Of course , it gets much better after that .
And we made them respond to people , but we found that people were very amateurs and childhood with them .
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Little Man . &quot; &quot; And we were kind of interested in play with the idea of invisible .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisible ?
So we worked with a company that specializes in surveillance with cameras , and we asked them to develop software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and exchange one person with the background , making them invisible .
So I &apos;ll just show you a first prototype .
On the right-hand side you can see my colleague Soran , who &apos;s actually inside the space .
And on the left , you see the working video where the camera made it invisible .
Surn goes into the room . Pop ! He becomes invisible .
And you can see the camera is following it and erased .
This is a very early video , so we didn &apos;t take care of the overlap and all that , but it got pretty fast , later .
So the way we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking at space , and we had one screen , one per wall .
And when the people walked into the room , they would see themselves on the screen , just with one difference : One person was constantly invisible anywhere they moved in the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; shadow of the Sun . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a paper sheet , like a cut of painting kids of oil spill or sunlight .
And from the front , the object looks very strong and resilient , and on the side , it almost looks very weak .
So people would go into the room and they would almost ignore it , think it &apos;s just garbage lying there .
But as soon as they would go through it , it would start climbing the wall in a prosthetic movement .
And it was tired , and it was a course every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a cartoon of a reverse person .
His head is so heavy . It &apos;s filled with heavy thoughts , which is kind of falling into its hat , and its body is grown from it almost like a plant .
Well what he does is he moves around the area in a very , very memorable way on his head in a very unpredictable and very slow motion .
And it &apos;s pretty limited by that circle .
Because if the circle wasn &apos;t there , and the floor was really straight , it would start to turn around .
And there are no wires .
So I &apos;ll just show you a case — so when people go into the room , it activates this object .
And it &apos;s very slow , for a few minutes , sort of lifting slowly , and then it gets a momentum and it looks like it almost falls down .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to get an instinct viewer to almost go and help , or save the object .
But he doesn &apos;t really need it , because he , again , kind of manages to lift himself .
So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our work , for years to do the mechanics right and the equilibrium balance .
And it was very important for us to find the exact moment in which it would fall , because if we did it in a way that it would fall , then it would hurt itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall down enough , it wouldn &apos;t cause that capitalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a quick video where we do tests — it &apos;s much faster .
This is my colleague . He left it .
Now he &apos;s stressed , so he &apos;s going to grab him .
But he doesn &apos;t need , because he &apos;s able to pick himself up .
So this is a work that &apos;s very interested in us , working with the aesthetics of the fur that are embedded in thousands of different little measurements of optical fibers , which are sparked like the night sky .
And this is at the scale of the night sky .
So we wrapped up with this a balloon shape , in the form of a bee , which had been handed out of the ceiling .
And the idea was to kind of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar shape of the bear , which is very inspiring and intimate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the bear &apos;s shape and you would almost perceive it as a hole in space , and as if you look at the star sky .
So this is the last job , and it &apos;s still at work , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Water . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a little cube about this size standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and when you approach it , it &apos;s trying to scare you by growing a double cube at four times the size of the volume .
So this object is expanding and contracting without a break to create intelligence dynamics and the people around it — almost as if it &apos;s trying to hide a secret within the seams or something like that .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really like technology , because it makes us a lot of pain in work over the years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way it can help us express the emotions and the behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
And once a creature jumps in our head , it &apos;s almost as if the creative process is to discover the way that this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to wear and what way it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m very happy to be here .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , because it &apos;s going to be a little weird . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And in here , I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
It &apos;s here .
I mean the Earth .
And in &quot; &quot; us , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in the auditorium , but for life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from one-celled composites , from darkness and dark in mushrooms and flying bears . ( Laughter )
The interesting thing is that Earth is the only place we know there is life — 8.7 million species .
We were looking elsewhere , maybe not as well as we should or could , but we were looking and not finding at all ; the Earth is the only place we know about life .
Is Earth special ?
It turns out , for all 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
On the one hand , all life on Earth needs energy .
On the other hand , life needs food or nutrition .
And it looks like a disabled request , especially if you want a tomato in a reef .
So it leaves the thing in the middle as the High Line , the hardest thing to get .
Not an email , but water .
( Laughter ) Even though Aille could be pretty cool . ( Laughter )
And not frozen water , not water in a gas situation , but liquid water .
That &apos;s what life needs to survive , every life form .
And many bodies in the solar system don &apos;t have liquid water , so we don &apos;t look there .
Other bodies in the solar system can be liquid water in abundance , even more than the Earth , but they &apos;re trapped under ice layer , so access to them is difficult , hard to reach them , it &apos;s even difficult to find out if there &apos;s any life there .
So it leaves a number of bodies that we need to take into account .
So let &apos;s simplify the problem for ourselves .
Let &apos;s just think about liquid water on the surface of the planet .
You have to have an atmosphere so that water will be liquid .
You have to be very careful with this atmosphere .
But if there &apos;s too much atmosphere , and it &apos;s too thin or too cold , the star becomes like Mars , too cold .
So too hot Venus , Mars is too cold , and the Earth is just like it is .
However , I &apos;d like to remind you two things from the story of love , which may not be thinking much about , but I think are very relevant here .
Number one : If Mother Duba &apos;s bowl was too cold when love came into the room , does it mean she was always too cold ?
Or could it be at the temperature that you wanted somewhere else ?
And that &apos;s true of planets as well .
They &apos;re not static things . They &apos;re changing .
They &apos;re diverse . They &apos;re evolving .
And atmospheres behave the same way .
Let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
And it can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as liquid .
This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars has changed , and it has changed significantly .
And it changed from a situation that we would define properly for living , because the three requirements for life existed long ago .
Where is this atmosphere that allowed water to be liquid on the surface ?
One hypothesis is that she ran out into space .
Atmospheric particles got enough energy to unleash the gravity of the planet , escaped out into space , and never came back .
And this happens with any atmospheric body .
It &apos;s just a matter of scale and scale .
So we &apos;d like to understand how much material smells over time so that we can explain this change .
How do atmospheres get their energy for the smell ?
How do particles get enough energy to run ?
Light escaped from the Sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and heat the particles .
Yes , I dance , but they — ( Laughter ) God forbid , not even in my wedding . ( Laughter )
They get enough energy to escape and unleash the gravity of the planet by warming alone .
Another way they can get energy is solar power .
And of course , a distance of a planet from the Sun determines its temperature .
It has to be about a habitable environment .
But maybe there are other things that we should take into account .
The Earth has this field ; Venus and Mars don &apos;t .
Magnetic fields form in the deep interior part of a planet by electrical pulsion of a established liquid matter that creates a giant magnetic field that surrounds the Earth .
If you have a compass , you know what direction the north is .
Venus and Mars don &apos;t have that .
( Laughter ) Does it affect a worthy environment ?
Well , how can that affect ?
Many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet is used as a protector for the atmosphere , from solar power particles around the planet a little bit like an effect of a field of power associated with an electrical charge of these particles .
I &apos;m imagining this to a salad agent for planets to defend against insistence .
So the effect , then , is that the Earth might have been protected for billions of years , because we had a magnetic field .
The atmosphere couldn &apos;t escape .
Mars , on the other hand , was not protected because it didn &apos;t have a magnetic field , and for billions of years , maybe enough atmosphere has been reduced from it to make the transition from a habitable planet to a planet that we see today .
Other scientists think that magnetic fields might behave like boat sails , allowing the planet to be more influenced by the energy of the solar wind than could be influenced by those units .
The saints can collect energy from the solar wind .
The magnetic field can gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
If you &apos;ve ever experienced it , it &apos;s amazing .
We know the energy goes in .
We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles go out and if the magnetic field affects it in some way .
So I presented a problem here for you , but I don &apos;t have a solution yet .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How do we work on it ?
Well , we sent spacecraft to all three planets .
It &apos;s designed to measure atmospheric escape .
We have similar measurements from Venus and the Earth .
And we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for a living environment or not .
Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
And economically , but deep .
But more than that , what we &apos;re going to learn from these planets can be applied on atmospheres everywhere , including planets that we &apos;re now watching around other stars .
In the 20 years , we &apos;ve gone from knowing about zero planets outside of our solar system , knowing about so much , that we don &apos;t know which ones to explore before .
Every direction will help .
In fact , based on observations that Kepler took and other similar observations , we now believe that within 200 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy , on average , every star has one planet at least .
In addition , we estimate that between 40 and 100 billion of these planets will be defined as life expectations , only in our galaxy .
You can &apos;t do it . You can &apos;t go there , still not .
Ultimately , and meanwhile at least , this is our red dot , right here .
It &apos;s the only planet that we know deserves life , although very soon we might argue about more .
But meanwhile , this is the only planet worth living , and this is our red dot .
I &apos;m very glad we &apos;re here .
Thank you .

I love the Internet .
Really .
Think about all the things we got at the time .
Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all entertainment , all business , all trade .
And this is happening in our lifetime .
I &apos;m sure one day they will write history books for hundreds of years from now . Our time , our generation will be remembering a ball that &apos;s become online , the generation that built something truly global .
And yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , severe problems , security problems , problems with privacy .
I spent my career fighting these problems .
Let me show you something .
Here I hold Brain .
This is CDC 5.25 infected with the Brain.A. virus .
This is the first virus found for PC computers .
And we even know where Brain came from .
We know because he told us within the code .
Let &apos;s look together .
All right .
This is Calypton Hackleton &apos;s Asperger sector , and if you look deep in , you see that right in this place , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to shout . &quot; &quot; And it goes on , 1986 , Bazeit and Amojad .
Bzeit and Amojad are private names , Pakistani private names .
In fact , it also says a phone number and a address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) This is 1986 .
Today we are in 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years .
The problem of viruses in PC is 25 years old .
Half a year ago , I went to Pakistan myself .
And here are some pictures I took in Pakistan .
This is from the city to Ehur , which is 300 miles south of Ebuntaboad where Ben Laden is caught .
This is a typical street .
And here &apos;s the street and the leading way to this building , through 730 in Alabama Ikbel .
And I &apos;m pulling the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
Bezip and Amojad , still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And yes , here is a buzzing .
This is his brother Amojad .
They are the people who wrote the first PC virus .
Of course , we had an interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they felt about what they started .
And I had some satisfaction when I heard that both of them were attacked and infected dozens of times viruses were not related over the years .
And so there &apos;s some justice in the world after all .
The viruses that we used to see in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s are no longer a problem .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what they looked like then .
I run a system here that allows me to run very old software on a modern computer .
I &apos;ll make some drives . I &apos;ll go there .
Here we have a list of old viruses .
I &apos;m going to run some of them on the computer .
For example , let &apos;s start with Centipede virus .
You can see on the screen up , there &apos;s a lot of legs running on the screen as you stick with the virus .
You know you &apos;ve been infected , because it appears .
Here &apos;s another one , a virus called Crash created in Russia in 1992 .
Now one that also makes noise .
( Cyrus noise ) And the last example , guess what the virus does .
Yeah , a guy walks you on the screen when you get infected .
Well , it used to be easy to know that you were infected with the virus , when the virus was written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , they &apos;re no longer written by amateurs and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What you see here in the background is an example of one of the systems that we run in the lab , which we follow the world &apos;s friendships .
We can see in real time that we stopped viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and in other places .
In fact , if I connect the computer back in the lab through the network , we can see in real time a taste of the number of viruses , some new examples of malware we find every day .
Here &apos;s the last virus that we found in a file called SOverexe .
And we found it here three seconds ago . One in front of it , six seconds ago .
And if we go down , the data is huge .
We find dozens and maybe even hundreds of thousands .
And this is from the last 20 minutes every day .
So where does all this come from ?
Well today , these are organized crime gangs writing viruses because they make money out of it .
As gangs like , let &apos;s go to Gangstadybuk.com .
This is a website that &apos;s activated from a mixture of people who buy computers infected with viruses .
If you write viruses and you can stick Windows computers , and you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell these computers — other people &apos;s computers — these guys .
And they will really pay you money for the computers .
Well how do these guys make money from the infected computers ?
There are a number of ways , like Truvian banking , that will steal money from your bank account when you do actions on the bank site , or the request registration .
Most of the rainbow , hidden from the display , is in the computer and recording every note recorded in a keyboard .
You sit in front of the computer looking for things in Google .
Your Google search is preserved and sent to criminals .
Every email you write is preserved and sent to criminals .
Also every password you type in and so on .
But the thing they &apos;re most looking for is Online Transition Things acquired online stores .
Because when you acquire the Internet , you type the name , the shipping address , the number of credit card and the security code .
And here &apos;s an example of a file that we found in the server a few weeks ago .
This is the credit card number , this is his attacker , this is the security code , and this is the name of a ticket owner .
When you get access to these details , you can order what you want on their name .
And this is , of course , a problem .
We now have a commercial and business acousticia built around an online crime .
One example of how these guys are able to earn money from their operations . We go and look at the pages of the Internet and look for people who are terrified .
We &apos;re going to find people like Byrne Sandin , instead of Sweden , and partnered with crime , also registered in the difficult pages of the Interpole , Mr. Jane , the U.S. citizen .
They ran a operation called I.MU , performing a crime using a computer that made millions .
They &apos;re both at the very moment .
Nobody knows where they are .
Companies in the United States a few weeks ago , made a bank account in Switzerland belonged to tomorrow . Jane , into account this bank were 14.9 million dollars .
And so the amount of money that crime online produces is significant .
And that means that these criminals can invest money in attacks .
We know that these crimes recruit programmers , testing people , check the code , they have data management systems and databases .
And they can afford to test how we work , how security people work , and try to bypass us and the defense systems that we build .
They also use the global nature of the Internet for their benefit .
I mean , the Internet is international .
So it &apos;s called the Internet .
And if you go and look at what &apos;s going on in the online world , here &apos;s a video from Claried Netw.org. , demonstrating how one harvest moves around the world .
This process , I think started in Estonia , goes from country to country once they tried to turn the site off .
You can &apos;t turn them off .
They will move from country to country , from one judge to another , all over the world . They use our fact not to coordinate global policing actions like this .
And so the Internet is simulated to have free flight cards for all the cyber criminals in the world .
Now , the offenders who couldn &apos;t get to us before we get to us now .
So how do you actually find online criminals ?
How do you hunt them ?
I &apos;ll give you an example .
We have a shadow file here .
Here I &apos;m looking at the catastrophic data of a picture file , which includes a malicious code .
And that actually means that if you try to open the picture on the Windows Machine , the malicious code will take over your computer and run a code .
Now if we look at the image file , here &apos;s the ceiling of the picture , and here &apos;s the code of the attack start .
And this code is encrypted , let &apos;s figure it out .
It was encrypted with XOR 97 function .
Just believe me , like this , like this .
And we can go here and just like that to decipher it .
The yellow part of the code is now decoded .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t look so different from the source .
But keep staring at it .
Notice that down here is an internet address uniontoek.com / idoxe and when you watch the picture in the computer , it will go to this address , download and run the software .
And this is a backdoor for a computer .
But even more interesting , if we continue to decipher , we &apos;ll find the next mysterious text that says O600KO78RK , nice .
This code is under encryption as a kind of signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I looked at the code , and I tried to figure out what it meant .
Of course I discovered it .
I got zero results , it wasn &apos;t there .
So I talked to folks in the lab .
And we have some Russian folks in the lab , and one of them mentioned , it ends up in RNA , like Russia .
And 78 is a city code for St. Petersburgh .
For example , you can find it in phone numbers and license plates and so on .
So I was looking for contact people at St. Petersburg , and after a long way , we ended up finding one specific website .
Here &apos;s the Russian guy running his website for years running his own website , and he writes a blog under Live Journal Popular .
And in a blog , he writes about his life , and his life in St. Petersburg . He &apos;s in the early 20s , writes about his cat , his girlfriend .
And he &apos;s driving a very nice car .
In fact , the guy is driving at Marcedes S600 and 12 engine 6.0 liter with over 400 horsepower .
Now , this is a very nice car for a 20-year-old kid and something at St. Petersburg .
How do I know about the car ?
Because he also writes about her in a blog .
He had an accident .
In the middle of the city of Santa Peterborg , he walked in with the car in another car .
And he put some pictures of the crash on the blog . This is his choreographer , here &apos;s the car , Lada Sara , who he got in .
And you can see the hardware license plate run at 78RNA .
And if you look at the whole picture , you can see that the Redades license is O60000000000KO8RN , nice .
Now , I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I was , that &apos;s where I would say , &quot; &quot; I finished my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when you perceive computer criminals ?
Actually , it doesn &apos;t usually get there .
In most absolute majority of criminal crime , we don &apos;t even know what the continent came from .
Even if we could find them , there &apos;s often no result .
The local police don &apos;t work , and if so , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for other reasons you can &apos;t get them down .
I would love if it was easier , unfortunately it wasn &apos;t .
But things are changing at a very rapid rate .
You &apos;ve all heard of Stuxnet .
If you look at what Stuxnet did is she pasted it .
This is S7-400 PLC , a programmable analog controller .
And that &apos;s what runs our infrastructure .
That &apos;s what runs everything around us .
PLC , these little boxes without a display , without a keyboard , programmed , put into action and do the work .
For example , the elevators in this building are probably dominated by these .
And Stoxnet infects one of these , it &apos;s a huge revolution in the risks that we face .
Because all around us is controlled by these .
I &apos;m talking about critical infrastructure .
Surbs , power plants , chemical factories , factories for food , look around — everything is run by computers .
Everything is run by computers .
It &apos;s all based on working computers .
We &apos;ve become dependent on the Internet , depending on basic things like electricity , computers work .
And this is something big that has created new problems for us .
We have to create a way to continue to work even though computers have stopped .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The point of honesty is that we can do things even though the things we took for granted are not there .
These are basic things , thinking about continuity , about stimulation , thinking about the relevant things .
I told you , ( Laughter ) I love the Internet , really .
Think about all the services we have online .
Think about a situation you take , one day you don &apos;t have them for that reason or another .
I see the beauty in the future of the Internet , but I worry that we might not get to see it .
I worry that we &apos;re faced with problems because of online crime .
Online crime is the thing that could take all this future from us .
( Laughter ) My whole life I play the web , and I feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we take a risk of losing everything .
We have to do it globally , and we have to do it now .
What we need is a global enforcement system , international for finding this crime , these organized gangs that benefit millions of the attacks .
It &apos;s much more important than the running of antivirus or a firewall .
What &apos;s really important is to find the people behind the attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are going to become part of the world of crime of tomorrow and have not yet arrived there .
We have to find the people with the capabilities , but without the opportunities . We give them opportunities to use their capabilities for the greater good .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing at an extraordinary speed .
If you look at the diagram that &apos;s up here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , Goldman Sachs projections ahead of you suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same as the American economy .
And if you look at the diagram for 2050 , the Chinese economy will be twice the size of its American community , and the Indian economy , will be almost the size of the American economy .
And we have to remember at this point , these predictions were created before the crisis in the Western economy .
Two weeks ago , I was interviewing the last predictions published by BNP Maribas trying to predict when China &apos;s economy would go to the size of the American economy .
Goldman Sachs predicts that this will happen in 2027 .
The updated predictions after the crisis expect this to happen in 2020 .
It &apos;s just a decade from now .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental ways .
First , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , who have not stopped growing in the last 30 years , about 10 percent every year .
And within a decade , China will be the largest economy in the world .
Never in the history of the modern age has happened , that the largest economy in the world will be the one of a developing country , not of a developed country .
Secondly , for the first time in modern age , the dominant state in the world that I think China is going to be , will not be a Western country and will also have different roots of culture for reputation .
I know it &apos;s a welfare society in the West that when countries become more modern , they also become more Western .
This is an illusion .
There &apos;s a premise that progress is a direct result of competition , free market and technology .
Well , it &apos;s not ; progress is equally shaped by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will not become Western .
China will remain , in the most fundamental ways , very different .
So the big question is , how do we understand China ?
How do we try to understand that it &apos;s China ?
And the crazy problem that &apos;s going to change in the West right now is that the traditional approach allows us to understand in Western terms and using Western ideas .
This is a contradiction from their definition .
I want to offer you three building blocks that will help us try to understand what China is just as a starting point .
Let &apos;s start with the fact that China is not really nation-state .
So yes , she has been calling herself the nation-state for a hundred years , but anyone who knows one or two about China knows that this is an ancient story .
This is what China &apos;s borders looked like after the victory of the Chain &apos; 221 B.C. , at the end of the warrior countries — the birth of modern China .
And you can see it versus the borders of our time China .
Or right after that , the capital pool , all of that , 2,000 years ago .
And you can already see that it &apos;s passing most of what &apos;s known today as East China , which is populating most of China &apos;s population in the past and present .
What &apos;s remarkable about this is that what gives China the sense of being China , what gives Chinese their identity as Chinese , does not come from a timeline of hundreds of years not from the nation-state , as it has happened in the West , but , if you will , it &apos;s evolved as a civilization state .
I think , examples of this can be seen , in practices like the ancestor table , and like a very defined view of the country , and in a similar way , a very diverse view of the family , social bonds like genomics , cognitive values and so on .
These are all , from the time of civilization .
In other words , China , unlike Western countries and most countries around the world , is shaped by a sense of civilization , existence as a country of civilization and not as a nation-state .
And there &apos;s one thing to add to that , which is : Well , we know that China is large , huge , demographic and geographical , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we &apos;re less aware of is the fact that China is very diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways , very distributed .
You can &apos;t manage that scale from Beijing , although we think that &apos;s the situation .
It never was .
So this is China , a country of civilization , not a nation-state .
And what does all this mean ?
Well , I believe this has very diverse and distant effects .
I &apos;ll demonstrate two briefly .
The first is the first political value up for the Chinese is the unity . It &apos;s the constitution of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : collapse — the pyramid of the Roman Empire .
It &apos;s invasive , and it &apos;s been removed since then .
China , in that period of time , went in exactly the opposite direction , and in a full form of pain , held this great civilization , as a unified civilization state .
The second example is perhaps more prosaic , and it &apos;s Hong Kong .
Do you remember the transmission of Hong Kong , by Britain in 1997 ?
Could you remember what the Chinese Constitutional proposal was ?
One country , two governance systems .
And I &apos;m ready to bet that almost no one in the West believed them .
&quot; Fava &apos;s talk . &quot;
When China put her hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Now , 13 years later , the political and legal system in Hong Kong was different as it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . And why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , unacceptable , in a way of thinking about nation-state .
Think about the E.U. Germany , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically , the East was swallowed by the West .
One country , one nation , one rule system .
This is the mentality of the nation-state .
But you can &apos;t run a country as China , a country of civilization , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
It just doesn &apos;t work .
So , in fact , China &apos;s reaction about the Hong Kong issue as the Taiwan issue had a natural response : one civilization , many dominant systems .
Let me offer another building block , to try to understand China — maybe a point that &apos;s not so comfortable .
Chinese have a very different view of race in terms of most other countries .
Do you know , because out of 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they &apos;re the same race , the plutocrat race .
This is a completely different view , from the one that &apos;s been earned in the most populated state in the world .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — they &apos;re all racist .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel that way .
China is only racial in the margin .
So the question is , why ?
The reason I think , basically , is , again , back to the state of civilization .
The history of at least 2,000 years , the history of conquering , taking over , recording , getting confused , and so on , led to the process on its behalf , over time , this nation — Han , was created — of course , invited by a very strong sense of cultural identity .
The fundamental advantage of this historical experience was that without Haian , China was never able to stay united .
Its identity was the mortar that held this country united .
The big downside was that Han had a very weak view of cultural diversity .
They truly believe in their own ideas , and they are inadequate for those who don &apos;t belong to them .
From that , for example , for habitats and Tibetans .
Or — let me introduce you to my third building block , the Chinese country .
Well , the relationship between the country and the company in China is very different from the Western form .
So in the West , it &apos;s accepted to think crucially — we are now at least — that authority and legitimacy of the country is a function of democracy .
The problem with this assumption is that the Chinese country gets more legitimacy and more authority in Chinese than any Western country .
And the reason for that is because of the fact — well , there are two reasons , I think .
And predictably , it has nothing to do with democracy , because in our minds , China has no democracy at all .
And the reason for that is , first of all , because the country in China gets a ratio — it gets a special meaning in the state actually being representation , the embodiment and the flourishing of Chinese civilization , of the state of civilization .
This is the biggest sacrifice in China for something that has to do with intellectual role .
And the second reason is that , while in Europe and North America , the power of the country is challenged all the time — I mean , in the European tradition , historically against church , against the sectors of the Venezuela , against merchants and so forth — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state is not challenged .
She had no serious opponents .
And so you can see that the way power was built in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that Chinese have a very different view of the country .
While we tend to see it as invasive , stranger , an actual device whose power should be restricted or defined or fragmented , Chinese don &apos;t see the country so often and so cold .
The Chinese experience the country as a close person — not just as a close person , actually , as part of the family — not only , in fact , as part of the family , but the family &apos;s head , the patriarch of the family .
This is the Chinese perspective on the country — very different from ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society differently than what it looks like in the West .
And I would suggest that , in fact , what we &apos;re dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a kind of new paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve thought about before .
Know that China believes in the market and in the country .
I mean , Adam Smith wrote already in the late 18th century , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And a little bit of a mo period , it stayed true , more or less , ever since .
But this is combined with a very strong country , a field everywhere .
The country is everywhere in China .
I mean , she runs companies , many of them are still in public ownership .
Privacy companies , as big as they are , like Novo , depend enormously on state funds .
The goals of the economy , and so on are determined by the state .
And the country , of course , has been slaughtered into many other areas of life — as we know it — with something like a one-to-one policy .
More than that , this is an ancient , ancient tradition of Latin .
I mean , if you want an example of this , the Chinese wall is one example of this .
But there &apos;s more , this is China &apos;s largest canal , which has started in the fifth century before the sphere .
And her building was completed in the seventh century A.D.
It &apos;s been dipped over 1800 kilometers , connecting Beijing with the Anjo and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary infrastructure programs in China , which help us explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Square and many other manifestations of the country &apos;s ability inside China .
And here are three building blocks in front of us trying to understand the difference in China — the state of civilization , the concept of race and the nature of the country and its relationship with society .
And yet we insist , most of the time , to think that we can understand China by supporting Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western perceptions .
If you want to know why we &apos;re constantly trying to understand China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen in China are wrong — that &apos;s why .
Unfortunately , I think , I have to admit that I think the approach to China is a small Western mentality approach .
It &apos;s in some way a formula .
It &apos;s comfortable in that sense that we think we are the best , and therefore we are the universal scale .
And secondly , she &apos;s an approach of ignorance .
We &apos;re making real reference to a reef issue .
You know , there &apos;s an interesting paragraph in Paul Cohen &apos;s book , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen says that the West is thinking of itself as the most cosmopolitical thing of all other cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , he &apos;s the most horizontal product , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that he doesn &apos;t need to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because , at the end of the day it can , if you also need power , get things in its own way .
When the other cultures — actually the rest of the world , in fact — who were in a more convenient position , against the West , had to , with phosphorus , understand the West , because of the presence of the West in their societies .
And therefore , the result is that they are more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
For example , take the East Asian question .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Today the largest economic area in the world .
And I &apos;ll tell you now that East Asians , people from East Asia , they know bigger about the West than the West about East Asia .
Now , this point is critical , unfortunately , to the present .
Because what happens — back to the diagram at the beginning — Goldman Sachs diagram .
What &apos;s happening is that very quickly , in historical terms , the world is driven and designed , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 — very fast replacement on the places in G7 , or the G8 .
And there are two implications for that .
First of all , the West quickly loses its impact on the world .
It had a good demonstration , actually , a year ago — Copenhagen , a conference for the climate change crisis .
Europe was not at the end of the discussion table .
When has this happened the last time ?
I &apos;m willing to bet it was , apparently , about 200 years ago .
And that &apos;s what will happen in the future as well .
And the second implication is that the world , inevitably , as a result of that , will become , increasingly , less familiar to us , because it will be designed by cultures and historical events that we don &apos;t know , and we &apos;re not jealous of .
And finally , unfortunately — take Europe , America is a little different than that — but the Europeans , amazingly , I should say , they &apos;re ignorant , they &apos;re not aware of how the world is changing .
Some people — I have a English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is racing down to the female native native . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s the exaggeration .
But there &apos;s a problem that goes hand with this — that Europe is getting slowed down from the world — and it &apos;s a kind of loss of the sense of the future .
I mean , there were days that Europe , of course , navigated the future safely .
Take the 19th century .
But that , unfortunately , is no longer true .
If you want to feel in the future , and if you want to get away from the future , try China — here &apos;s the old Confucius .
This is a train station that you haven &apos;t seen yet .
It never looks like a train station .
This is the Guanghau new train station for speed trains .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have even more than the rest of the world together .
Or look at this : this is an idea , but this is an idea that will soon be tried in suburban Beijing .
Here &apos;s a bus in front of you , at the top row it carries about 2,000 people .
He &apos;s driving on a rail on the suburbs road , and the cars on the road are driving under it .
And it speeds up to about 160 miles an hour .
And this is how things are going to move , because China has a specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States . China has a huge number of people and savings in space .
And this is a solution to where China will have lots and lots of cities over 20 million people .
Okay , so how would I want to end ?
Well , what is our approach supposed to be towards this world that we see evolving very rapidly in front of us ?
We think it &apos;s going to have good implications and it &apos;s going to have bad consequences .
But I want to argue , above all , on a very positive picture for the world .
For 200 years , the world was controlled , in fact , by a particle from the world &apos;s psychology .
The part that they represent Europe and the United States .
The impact of countries like China and India — where 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represents the most important expression of democratization in the last 200 years .
civilizations and cultures , who ignored them , who were voiceless , who didn &apos;t listen to the collector , who didn &apos;t know about them , were going to win a new representation in the world .
As humanists , we have to accept , of course , this change , and we have to learn about these civilizations .
The big boat here was the one that was driving in the corner of Jong-ha at the beginning of the 15th century on the largest journey around the southern China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean , to East Africa .
The little boat in front of her was the ship , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean .
( Laughter ) Oh , look carefully , this is a silk age painted by Joe in 1368 .
I think they play golf .
God , the Chinese even invented the golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to revolutionize .
But before you wave a weapon or pop a song or pick color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
When I say revolution , I mean a dramatic and radical change in our mindset and our behavior — in our thinking and our behavior .
Why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because things don &apos;t work ; they just don &apos;t work .
And it really makes me sad , because I &apos;m tired of it that things don &apos;t work .
You know , I &apos;m tired of that we &apos;re not using our potential .
I &apos;m tired of it that we &apos;re always in the last place .
And we &apos;re in the last place in so many things — for example , in the social domain .
We &apos;re in the last place in Europe in innovation .
Here we are , here at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t inquire innovation .
We &apos;re in a last place in health care , and it &apos;s an important issue for a general sense of well-being .
And here we are , not just last in the European Union , but also last in Europe all , right at the bottom .
And worst — it was only published three weeks ago , many of you saw it , called the Economist .
We are the saddest place in the world , compared to GDP to the world &apos;s saddest place .
It &apos;s in the social domain . Let &apos;s look at education .
Where did we rank three weeks ago in another OECD report ?
Last one , reading , math and science , last .
Business : the lowest understanding of the European Union .
Environments bring benefit to society .
And as a result , what happens ?
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs doing business .
And that &apos;s despite the fact that it &apos;s clear to everyone that small businesses are the engine of economies .
We &apos;re the ones who employ the most people , make the most tax .
And if our engine is broken , guess what ?
Last place in Europe is GDP per capita .
Last one .
So , friends , it &apos;s not surprising , that 62 percent of the adults don &apos;t feel optimistic about the future .
We &apos;re miserable , our education is bad , and we have the worst business .
And these are facts , friends .
Not just practical stories , fairy tales .
No .
It &apos;s not some canony that I fought against Bulgaria . It &apos;s facts .
So I think it should be very , very clear that our system is broken .
Our thinking , and our behavior , our operating system of our adaptation is broken .
We need a dramatic change in our thinking and our behavior to change the face of Bulgaria for the better , for our friends , for our families and for the future .
How did that happen ?
Let &apos;s think positive now . We &apos;ll be positive from now . How did that happen ?
I think we &apos;re in the last place — and it &apos;s going to be dramatic for some of you — because we &apos;re making ourselves disabled .
We leave ourselves behind because we &apos;re not attributing importance to decade .
I said fun , yeah .
In case some of you forget what it &apos;s going on , this is what it looks like .
Incredible babies , funny kids , funny adults .
We don &apos;t underestimate the importance of making fun .
And the truth is , we &apos;re catalyzing .
And we inject it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to those three areas .
Social : 45 years of what ?
Communism — of the preferences of society and the country across the Indol and , by the way , the remix of creativity , the personal expression and innovation .
And where do we value ?
Because you see it . The way we implement , produce and use knowledge is influenced by social and institutional context , which tells us what about communism ?
Being serious .
Being really serious .
That &apos;s true .
( Applause ) Be serious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I got picked up in the park because I let my kids play the sand .
God forbid they play in the sand and walk , or even worse — in the water , it will kill them .
I &apos;ve been told by grandparents and grandmothers that shouldn &apos;t let kids play so much because life is a big deal and we need to train them to the seriousness of life .
We have a memory unit of seriousness transferred to us .
It &apos;s a social gene going through the heritage .
This is the scene garden .
Forty-five years of this is that they &apos;ve created what I call the grandmother effect . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And that &apos;s how it works .
Step one : The woman says , &quot; &quot; I want a baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : We have a baby . Great !
But what happens then at stage three ?
I want to go back to work , or because I have to advance my career or I just want to go to coffee drinks .
So I &apos;ll give the baby to the grandmother .
But Grandma &apos;s not allowed to forget that Grandma has been touched by the genocide for 45 years .
So what happens ?
It transfers the virus to the baby , and it takes a lot of time — it &apos;s a Scottish tree in the picture — until this shield gene comes out of our operating system .
What happens then ?
He entered education where we have an ancient education system that has changed very little in the last 100 years that believes in learning that has a change and standardization , and reduces the importance of self-expression , self-exploration , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and enterprise .
It &apos;s a connected system .
True story : I went looking for my white school .
We got to a small , expensive school like this and they tell me they &apos;ll learn mathematics 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read five times a day and all that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what about games and the breaks ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Huh , there won &apos;t be one minute of their falcon to their falcon . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five ! &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
And it &apos;s really a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we create unconscious , robotic workers who will be stuck in a guy who they have prepared for .
But forgive me , today &apos;s problems are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
We need adaptability , the ability to learn to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need mechanical workers .
But no , now our gene goes into action and makes us crawl in the importance of the decade .
We create robotic workers and treat them like don &apos;t assets to use them and then throw them away .
What does a typical workplace look like in Bulgaria ?
Autocratic will do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
There &apos;s no trust — you &apos;re obviously a perpetrator , so I &apos;ll install cameras .
( Laughter ) Culture — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to build a million little processes that can act on their route so you don &apos;t get out of the box .
And they limit — don &apos;t use your cell phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t surf the Internet , don &apos;t connect to IM .
It &apos;s because of what &apos;s not professional and not good .
And at the end of the day , it &apos;s an unsatisfying workplace , because you &apos;re under control , you limit you , you &apos;re not valued . And you don &apos;t enjoy .
In the social sector , in education and in business , you don &apos;t understand the importance of making fun .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re in the last place , because we don &apos;t understand the importance of making fun .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Steve , that &apos;s ridiculous . What a dual idea .
It can &apos;t be that the reason is funny .
Just fun , it &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the garden of seriousness .
So I tell you not .
And I &apos;ll show you this in the next part of the speech — the amusement is the killer , is the revolution , which we can use to change the face of Bulgaria for the better .
The amusement : Our brain is inherently constructed for amusement .
Evolution has selected , millions of years ago , the prevention of life and humans .
And you know what ?
Evolution does a very , very good job leaning properties that are not useful to us and selecting properties that give us a competitive advantage .
Nature was not stupid , and he pointed for amusement .
In the animal kingdom , for example ants , ants get fun .
You may not know that .
But when they play , they learn the social order and the dynamics of things .
Trats are fun , but it &apos;s something that you may not know rats that are more fun are larger brain owners , and they &apos;re better at learning skills .
Cats are fun . Well we all know .
But what you may not know is that kittens that move the course of it are not able to form social bonds .
They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
Dogs get funny .
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive over time .
Not the bears who learn to fish better survive .
These are the ones that are getting richer .
And one last interesting study , it turns out that there is a correlation between amusement and the size of the brain .
The more you play , the bigger the brains are .
Dolphins , a relatively large brain , are doing a lot .
But who do you think the biggest brain is also the major amusement ?
We humans .
Children get fun , we get fun — people from every nation , from every race , every color , every religion .
It &apos;s something universal — we &apos;re amusing .
And not only children , also adults .
A cool term : the United Kingdom — Conservation of the Transition and the properties of young people in the adult detail .
And who are the main Newtonian ?
Humans . We play sports .
We do it for fun , or as Olympic competitors , or as professionals .
We play the instrument .
We dance , we dance , we sing . We &apos;re just sharing .
Nature designed us for fun . Minecca to old .
We &apos;re designed to do it without the dance — to amuse and play a lot and not stop .
It &apos;s a huge benefit .
Just as animals have benefit , so do humans .
For example , it &apos;s been shown that this has to encourage natural growth in amygdala , in an area responsible for emotions .
It &apos;s proved to improve development in prefrontal cortex where there &apos;s a lot of cognitive activity going on .
As a result , what happens ?
We develop more emotional adolescence if we play more .
You develop better decision-making ability if you play better .
And these , friends , they work .
Not a fiction , not grandmother &apos;s stories , not practical . It &apos;s sharp science .
These are the benefits of the players .
It &apos;s a genetically modified right that we have , like walking , speaking , sight .
And if we make ourselves disabled about the amusement , we lay objects ourselves just like if it were any other fathers &apos; right .
We stop ourselves from going forward .
A quick exercise for a moment : itself your eyes and try to imagine a world without abundance .
Imagine a world without theater , no art without poetry , no dance , no soccer , no football , no football , no laughter .
What does a world like this look like ?
Pretty nasty .
Very upset .
And now imagine your workplace .
A fun place ? A goat ?
Or maybe your friends &apos; workplace — we &apos;re people thinking forward .
Is there fun ? Alice ?
Or is Bruce there ? Is it an autocratic , regulating , disbelief and disbelief ?
We have this kind of conceptual that the opposite of amusement is work .
We even feel guilty feelings if you see us getting fun at work .
Oh , my colleagues saw me laughing , they would think I probably don &apos;t have a job , or &quot; &quot; Oh , I should hide that the bus won &apos;t see me .
It will think I don &apos;t work hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : Our thinking is wrong .
The opposite of fun is not work . The opposite of fun .
He &apos;s depression , depression .
In fact , amusement improves our work .
Just as the benefit of humans and animals , that &apos;s how it &apos;s useful to play in the workplace as well .
For example , it inspires creativity .
It increases our openness to change .
You &apos;ve improved our ability to learn .
It gives you a sense of purpose and control — two leading motivational factors that raise productivity , and that &apos;s through amusement .
So before you think about amusement as just something unserious , amusement doesn &apos;t mean mindfulness .
You know , professional athlete enjoying skier , refers to it seriously , but he loves it .
It enjoys , it &apos;s mostly , it flows .
A doctor can be serious , but laughter is still a great drug .
Our thinking is wrong .
We don &apos;t have to feel guilty .
We need to pray the amusement .
A quick example of the corporate world .
FedEx , simple motto : people , service , profit .
If you treat your people like people , if your relationship to them would be great , they would be more satisfied , satisfied , with a sense of control and purpose .
And what happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
And when customers call them service and they &apos;re having happy people who can make decisions and they &apos;re full of satisfaction , how do you feel customers ? They feel great .
And what customers who feel great are doing ?
You buy more of the service you provide , and they tell more friends of them , which leads to more profit .
People , service , profit .
Increasing productivity , not reducing .
And you might say , &quot; &quot; Okay , that might work at FedEx somewhere in the United States , but it can &apos;t do it in Bulgaria .
No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; But it does work in Bulgaria , friends . Two reasons .
One — amusement is a universal issue .
There &apos;s no strange thing about the Balinese that we can &apos;t play with , except for the kind of seriousness that we need to get away from us .
Two — I tried it . I tried it in Sant .
When I got there , the number of customers wanted zero .
Not even one client was ready to turn others to us .
I asked everyone .
Our profit was July .
We had a marginalized profit , and unsatisfied interests .
Through some basic changes , changes like increased transparency , changes like encouraging self-intention and collaboration , encouraging cooperation , not automatically , things like focusing on the outcome .
I &apos;m not interested when you get to work in the morning . I &apos;m not interested when you &apos;re going .
I &apos;m interested just that your customers and your team are happy , and you &apos;re organized on this .
Why would I care if you get to work at 09 : 00 ?
Basically — encourage pleasure .
Through the joy and making good air , we &apos;ve been able to change Sant Chant from end to end , and in three short years — sounds a lot of time , but change takes time — every customer , from zero to customers to all the customers , turn to us , profit over the average in industry , and have a happy interest .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Where do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we won , every year we participated , in one of the great business ratings in small businesses .
Independent analysis of information that has been converted anonymously work in surveys .
It can work , and it works in Bulgaria .
There &apos;s nothing that stops us , except for our mentality about the amusement .
So here are some steps we can take — to conclude — to do with the amusement of this revolution .
First of all , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me just go home and think about it a little bit or something .
Secondly , if you don &apos;t have the sense of play , you have to rediscover it .
What it was in your childhood that made you enjoy , or you enjoyed it six months ago , but now you &apos;ve won promotion you can &apos;t enjoy it , because you feel you &apos;ve got to be serious , rediscover it .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a mountain climbing or reading books , or games .
Rediscover it . Because you are the leaders , the new leaders , lead to thinking .
You &apos;re the ones who have to go back to the office or talk to friends and ignite the change in the amusement revolution .
You have to , and if you don &apos;t feel it , your colleagues , your employees , will not feel it either .
You have to go back and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Strange idea . I get you to work . I &apos;m supposed to trust you .
I &apos;ll let you make decisions . I &apos;ll advise you , and I &apos;ll save authority to the lowest moments , rather than heights .
I &apos;m going to encourage intelligence criticism .
I &apos;m going to give you a grief about authority .
Because it &apos;s actually a way to challenge how things have been done since we can never get out of the public that we are in and bring innovative solutions to today &apos;s problems .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
We &apos;re going to explore the fear of the roots .
The fear is the enemy of the decade .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminating limitations .
Let them use the mobile phone for personal conversations — God forbid .
Let them surf the Internet .
Let them connect with chat .
Let them go out for lunch .
Lunch time is like a break in school .
It &apos;s when you go out into the world and you recharge the brain , meets friends , drinks beer , food a little bit , speaks , there &apos;s a synergy of ideas that you might not have before .
Let them do that . Give them that freedom , and generally — let them play . Give them enjoy the workplace .
So much of our lives go through us in the workplace , and what is it supposed to be ? A place of soft work , which in 20 years from now , will wake up and say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s all ?
Is that all it was ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not acceptable .
( Laughter ) So in closing , we need a dramatic change in thinking and behavior , but we don &apos;t need a worker revolution .
We don &apos;t need a working revolution .
What we need is the uprising of people who are amusing , what we need is the uprising of people who are amusing . What we need is the uprising of people who are amusing .
Seriously , we need to put together today is the beginning of the insurgency , but what you need to do is ignite the fire of the revolution . You need to go out and share your ideas and your success stories .
What has succeeded on the incentive injection of our lives , to our schools , and our work through the amusement , about how amusement produces a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; about how you move forward from innovation and productivity ; and ultimately , how amusement makes meaning .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do it and share this idea about the amusement , we can change the face of Bulgaria for the better .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Let me start by giving you and everything it requires is this : Change your posture for two minutes .
But before that , I &apos;m going to ask you to now test your body and what you do with it .
How many of you are reducing yourself ?
Sometimes we hold our arms like this .
Sometimes we stretch . I see you . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to ask you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
The body language fascinates us , and we &apos;re particularly interested .
We &apos;re interested , as you know — ( Laughter ) in interaction or strange smile , or a glucose view , or an image image , or maybe even something like a handshake .
Narrator : Here they go to ( Home ) Number 10 , and look what happens .
Even BBC and New York Times .
So clearly when we think about non-verbal behavior , or body language — as sociologists we call it non-verbal communication — that &apos;s a language , so what comes to our mind is communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
There are many reasons to believe that this is the right way to look at it .
We all infer conclusions and come to inclusive biases from the body &apos;s language .
These biases can predict significant occurrences in life like who we employ or promote , who we go to date .
For example , Nathanie Eddie , a researcher at the University of Texas , showed that when people watch Muslim videos 30 seconds of interaction going on between a doctor and a patient , the opinion that they &apos;re wearing on the kindness of the doctor can predict if the doctor will determine .
If you didn &apos;t use them right , you failed .
We are also influenced by our non-verbal communication , our thoughts , our emotions and our physiology .
So what non-verbal communication am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , I teach in college to lead business in a competitive world , so it was inevitable that I would be interested in the dynamics of power .
I was particularly interested in non-verbal expressions of power and control .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and control ?
In the world of animals , the phrases are about tension .
You increase your dimension , you stretch , grab space , basically you open .
It &apos;s about development , and it &apos;s true all over the world .
This movement , known as pride , was studied by Jessica Trisian . She showed .
We narrow ourselves . We don &apos;t want to encounter the person next to us .
And that &apos;s what happens when you put together with authority .
So if someone protects our own power , we tend to minimize ourselves . We don &apos;t imitate it .
I watch this behavior in the classroom , and what do I see ? I see that business students do show up .
When they sit down , they kind of spin space .
Other people are like courses when they enter , as soon as they enter , you see it .
I noticed some things about this .
Women do more like this than men . Women are consistently feeling .
Less powerful than men , so it &apos;s not surprising , but the other thing I &apos;ve noticed .
The participation is very important in a business class , because participation determines half the grade .
So the institutions for business leaders are trying to deal with this gender gap .
So I started to wonder , there are the students who come out like this , and they take part of classes .
There &apos;s some evidence that it does .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but also , when we have to smile by holding a pen between the two , like this , it makes us feel happy .
It works in two directions . When it comes to power .
So the second question was , we know that thoughts change the body , but is it true that the body also changes thoughts ?
And when I say thoughts , what do I actually talk about ?
What does someone &apos;s thoughts look like ?
Not surprisingly , powerful people tend to be more assertive and self-confident , more optimistic .
They even feel like they &apos;re going to win luck games .
So there are many differences . They take more risks .
But the truth is that power is also how you respond to stress .
Do we want a strong leader that &apos;s dominant , full of testosterone , but one that &apos;s stressed in a short hour ?
Probably not . We want a person .
So we have evidence that the body can affect thoughts , at least in a flat way , and role-change can affect the thoughts .
Suppose somebody &apos;s trying to change their role , what happens if they do it at a minimum level , a little manipulation , a small intervention ?
Two more .
You can sit or stand up .
And here &apos;s the posture of power .
Patients , they narrow themselves .
When you touch the neck .
And that &apos;s how it happens . They go in .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
That &apos;s what we found about testosterone .
Again , two minutes and you get all these changes .
That &apos;s what you get about Curitize .
So our non-verbal communication seems to affect so it &apos;s not just because of others , but it &apos;s also our own .
Our body also changes our thoughts .
So we think that what &apos;s important , that is , where you should use it like situations that have threat from the environment , where you get evaluation .
It &apos;s not about talking to other people .
It &apos;s about talking to yourself . What are you doing ?
That &apos;s what we want to look at .
It takes five minutes . They &apos;re recorded .
So for five minutes , nothing , which is worse than you &apos;re wrapped in the middle .
People hate it . That &apos;s what Maryan L-Prince calls .
And then there are the types that watch recordings .
They have no idea about hypotheses or conditions .
It &apos;s about animals that they bring into their words .
Things like this . People bring their real self with them .
That &apos;s what makes the impression , or at least helps it form .
So I say , fake until you get me not — that &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to come there and then still feel like a predictor .
I don &apos;t want to feel like a predictor .
When I was 19 , I had a difficult road accident .
I was thrown out of the car and rolling several times .
I woke up in the rehabilitation limb .
I was aware of my IQ because I was known as brilliant , and we were preparing me as a child .
I was forced to retire from school and kept trying to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t succeed in finishing school .
I &apos;m a predictor .
You &apos;re going to stay and that &apos;s what you do .
I actually do it . &quot; &quot; And so that &apos;s what I did . Five years in adult school .
But she does , and I understand the feeling .
I mean , it can fake , it can become like this .
It changed .
So I want to tell you , don &apos;t fake until you do that .
You fake until you become one .
Do it enough times until you get what you need and become like this .
The last thing I &apos;ll tell you is this .
Small adjustments can lead to big changes .
That &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s what you need to do . Design your brain .
That testosterone will rise and the course will decrease .
Don &apos;t get out of that feeling that you haven &apos;t really shown who you are .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Big creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
Speaking . Big creativity is amazing , absurd , rational , irrational , powerful .
Big creativity can spread patience , the triumph of freedom , make education sound like a brilliant idea .
( Laughter ) Big creativity can turn a sperm on a drill , or show a person that has other options except a drill .
Big creativity can make politicians elected , or parties not elected .
It can make war look like a tragedy or a joke .
Creativity is the noisy that put passwords on our rocket and maybe our lips .
The pioneer shows the simple way through the unseen moral embarrassment .
Science is smart , but big creativity is less familiar , more magical , and now we need the magic .
That &apos;s the goal we need it .
Climate changes fast , too fast .
And big creativity has to do what it does very well : to drag us to think differently with creative thinking running through .
We &apos;re tempted to act differently with pieces of creativity .
Here &apos;s an example of an initiative piece of creativity that I &apos;m involved in using creativity that will make people look more green .
Video : Man : You know , instead of driving today , I &apos;m going to go .
Number : So he went , and when he went , he saw things .
Beautiful and wonderful that otherwise he wouldn &apos;t see .
A God who draws his leg . A flying motorcycle .
The father and his daughter are separated from the bike by a mysterious wall .
And then he stopped . She went before him .
The woman with the child spoke to him through the fields and broke his heart .
Of course , she was a little older .
You can say it &apos;s old a lot .
But he felt all his old returns to his return .
Ford , he said gently . It was her name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say no word , August , &quot; &quot; she said , because it was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent near the Karoon , exactly 300 billion from here .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford spread , and she opened one foot , and after that .
Gosti came into her bold and she fell in love with her at a uniform rate and at the same time she was filming , because she was a passionate amateur of porn movies .
The land moved both .
And they lived together happily until this day .
And all of that because he decided to go that day .
( Applause ) Andy Hobbeck says : We have science , we have a discussion .
The moral arrow is already on the table .
Big creativity is required to take everything , do it simple and sharp .
Make it connect . Make it work .
So this is a call , a request , to the very talented community of TED .
Let &apos;s be creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do that soon . Thank you .
( Applause )
Bluto : So , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Okay .
So I &apos;m going to count for you , so we don &apos;t do it together .
Okay , one , two , three . Audience : Can you read it ?
BL : Incredible . What about it ? One , two , three . Audience : You don &apos;t read it .
BL : Well . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? And what about it ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
BL : What do you read ? There are no words here .
I said read what you see . Right ?
And it says , &quot; &quot; Am Row Sea ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you had to answer . Right ? Why is that ?
Because perception is fundamental in our experience .
Right ? The brain takes uncompromised information and finds what it means , I mean , we never see what it is , we don &apos;t see information , we just see what was useful for us to see in the past .
Okay ? What that means , in the context of perception , is that we &apos;re all similar to this frog .
( Laughter ) She gets information . She produces a useful behavior for her . ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : A ! A ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go like we wanted , we get a little bit excited , right ?
But we &apos;re talking here about perception , right ?
And perception confirms everything we think , you know what we believe , hope , dreaming , wearing how we fall in love , everything starts with perception .
If perception is fundamental in our history , it means that we always respond to what we &apos;ve done in the past .
But actually , it &apos;s a huge problem , because it means we &apos;re always going to see things the same way .
So I want to tell you a story about renewable vision , and all the new concepts start in a similar way .
They start with a question .
The problem with questions is that they create uncertainty .
And uncertainty is a bad thing . Evolution is a bad thing . If you &apos;re uncertain about a predator , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even sea disease is a result of uncertainty .
If you &apos;re in an annah belly , your inner ear says you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because they &apos;re moving in coordination to the ship , say you &apos;re standing without moving .
The brain can &apos;t deal with the uncertainty of this information , and it gets sick .
The question &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things , because it leads you to uncertainty .
And yet , ironically , the only way you can ever do something new is to travel into this space .
How can we ever do something new ? Unfortunately , evolution gives us an answer , right ?
And it allows us to deal with even the hardest questions , the best questions are ones that make the greatest uncertainty .
These are the questions that undermine sustainability . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how life started , or what &apos;s beyond the universe , but ask about what you think you already know is to actually take risk .
So what is the answer of evolution to the problem of uncertainty ?
Play .
Play is not just a process . Experts in the game will say it &apos;s a form of being .
Play is the only human practice in which uncertainty is blessed , uncertainty is what makes play fun .
A modified game , right ? It &apos;s open to possibilities , and it &apos;s sharing . Play is actually our way to create social connections , and it &apos;s driven by itself . So we play to play . The object of play is the reward itself .
If you look at these five forms of being , you &apos;ll notice that these are the exact same shapes that are needed to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the grateful part of an article .
It &apos;s actually defined by the form of being , the one here , and it &apos;s perceiving everything that &apos;s creative .
If you add rules for a decade , we have a game .
This is the essence of a scientific experiment .
So , with these two ideas , science is an experience and experiments are a game , we asked , can anyone be a scientist ?
And who is better to ask than 25 children at 8-10 ?
Because they &apos;re experts in games . So I took my bee scene to a small school in a protein , and the goal of that was not just to get kids to see science in another light , but , through a scientific process , to see themselves differently . Okay ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Here I have to say we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because scientists said small kids couldn &apos;t add a significant contribution to science , and teachers said the same thing .
So we did it despite that . Right ? Of course .
So here &apos;s some of the questions . I wrote them in a little letter so you wouldn &apos;t have to read it . The point is that five of the children &apos;s questions were actually the basis of scientific publications in the last five or 15 years . You know ?
So they asked questions that were meaningful for experts .
Now I want to share the stage with someone who &apos;s pretty special . Okay ?
She &apos;s one of the youngest people involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest scientists in the world who have published their work , and once you get up on stage , she will become the youngest speaker you &apos;ve ever run at TED . You know ?
Now , science and asking questions is a matter of courage .
And it &apos;s the human expression of courage , because it &apos;s going to stand here now and talk to you .
So Aimee , are you ready to come up here please ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Amy is going to help me tell the story about what &apos;s called the Blakton Bee Project , and first she &apos;ll tell you about the question they thought about . So go ahead , Aimee .
AM : Thank you , Be . We thought it was easy to see the relationship between humans and apes in the way we think , because we &apos;re similar to each other .
But we wondered if there might be something to do with other animals , it would be amazing to find that humans and bees think similar , because they look so different from us .
So we asked if humans and bees might solve complicated problems in the same way .
In fact , we wanted to know if bees can adapt to new situations through rules and conditions that have been taught before , so what if bees can think like us ?
Well , that would be amazing , because it &apos;s only a million neurons here .
But it makes pretty sense that they can , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of an hour a day , light , weather , or any angle they approach to the flower . ( Applause ) BL : The next step was to design an experiment , which is actually a game . So the kids went and designed this experiment , and so — well , the farmer — and so , Amy , you can tell us what the game was , and what was the beetle was ?
EA : The puzzle that we thought about was due to af-then legal rules .
We asked bees to learn not only to get to a color , but to get to a flower in a particular color only when it &apos;s in a pattern .
They only got a prize if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by yellow .
There are several different rules that bees can learn , to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , what ?
What was really exciting about this project was ours and where there was no idea if it would work .
It was completely new , and nobody has done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : including teachers , and it was very difficult teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go without having any idea what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so a lot of the credit comes to David Sardock , who was the collaborator in this project . Okay ?
I &apos;m not going to go through all the details of the study now because you can actually read about it , but the next step is a observation . So here &apos;s some of the students in the observation time . They collect information about where the bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strawick : What we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to be a student : 5C .
DG : She &apos;s still going here ? Student : Yes .
DG : So follow each one . Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
BL : Can you help me here , Henry ? &quot; What good scientist would say that , huh ?
Student : There are two up there .
And three in there .
BL : Okay ? So we have observations . We have raw data .
They do the simple calculus , average , etc .
And we know we want to share the data . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write it out and try to make it advertising . Okay ? So you have to write it .
So we go , of course , to the pub . Right ? ( Laughter ) The cup on the left is mine , right ? ( Laughter ) I tell them , in essay there are four different parts : progress , research method , results , discussion .
In the introduction , you write what the question is and why ?
In the research method , what did you do ? In the results , what did you discover in the observation ?
And in the discussion , who cares about it ? Right ?
It &apos;s a scientific paper , largely . ( Laughter ) So the kids gave me the words , right ? I connected to the narrative , which means that this article was written in the language of children .
And I didn &apos;t write that . write it Amy and the other students in the classroom . As a result , this science article begins in &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In the episode of the results , it says , &quot; &quot; Stage of training , the puzzle ... What a tension ! &quot; &quot; You got it ? ( Laughter ) And in the system , it says , &quot; And then we put the bees inside the refrigerator . ( Laughter )
So there &apos;s the headline here . We have a number of writers here .
All those who address emphasized letters are 8-10 years old .
The first author is an elementary school in Luckton , because if you ever quoted it , it will be &quot; &quot; Belakton and Shoots , &quot; &quot; and not someone &apos;s name , so we submitted the article to a public magazine , and he says that . He said a lot of things , but he said that .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the article fails in our quality control in some different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts with &quot; &quot; Once upon a time , &quot; &quot; The data was written in colorful pencils , etc . &quot; ( Laughter ) So we said we &apos;d go to peer review . We sent the article to David Purroughs , from the National Academy of Sciences , the world &apos;s specialists , and it says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s absolutely true .
Larry Malloni , an expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The article is great .
The work would be published if it was written by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We brought it back to editor .
They said no .
So we asked Henry and Natalie to write a interpretation that would maximize the findings for scientists , right ? We put the protests , and we served it to Bioji Letters .
The article was criticized by five independent visitors , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do science , it took two years to publish it . ( Laughter ) Austrian science , actually , isn &apos;t it ? So it does Amy and her friends to the youngest scientists in the world who published their work .
And how were the responses ?
Well , the article published two days before Christmas , took it 30,000 times on the first day , right ?
It was the selection of the editor in the Science magazine , the leading journal in science .
He will always have free access to him in a biologist Letters .
This is the only article that &apos;s ever going to be available for free in this magazine .
Last year , this was the second article in the amount of download in Bioji Letters , and the responses , not just scientists and teachers , but from the general public as well .
And I &apos;ll just read one of them .
&quot; &quot; I read &quot; &quot; Doubury Blakton &quot; &quot; recently . I don &apos;t have words to describe exactly how I feel right now .
What you &apos;ve done , guys , is real , honest and amazing .
Curiosity , interest , innocence and enthusiasm are the most important and important things to engage in science .
Who would have it if not kids ?
Please welcome the children &apos;s team in my name . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to end with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it for you ? ( Laughter ) Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , come , yeah . Yeah . Okay .
We said science involves risk , so it &apos;s a huge risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Yeah ? Because we &apos;ve only done it once in the past . ( Laughter ) And you love technology , right ?
SW : Yeah , but I love myself .
BL : That &apos;s the embodiment of technology . Okay .
Now — ( Laughter ) OK . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demo , OK ?
You have to shout your eyes , and you have to vote , to where you hear my hands . Okay ?
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Okay , what if everybody there screamed . One , two , three ?
Audience : ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughter ) Great . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
Everyone &apos;s there screaming . ( screaming ) Where does the sound come from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
Right ? We go through life and always respond , but if we ever want change , we have to get into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , it allowed him to see the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to enter uncertainty through the game process , right ?
Now , real education for science should be based on giving people a voice and allowing them to express that voice , so I asked my mom to be the last voice in this short story .
So , Aimee ?
EA : This project was really exciting to me , because it inspired life the discovery process , and showed me that everybody , really everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead to a big discovery .
Changing somebody &apos;s mindset about something can be easy or hard , everything depends on how the person feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy , once we played the games and started thinking about the puzzle , I realized that science is not just a boring profession , and that anybody can discover something new .
Just need an opportunity . My opportunity came with it , and the Bluetooth Project from Blakton .
Thank you . BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to do the world &apos;s biggest problems in this talk .
I &apos;m not going to talk about the skeptical climate researcher , it &apos;s probably a good choice .
( Laughter ) This is a book that the professor put together , but I &apos;m going to ask the question — what are the world &apos;s biggest problems ?
And before I start , I &apos;m going to ask each and every one of you to pull out a pen and paper , so you can help me look at this .
So take out your pen and paper .
Ultimately , the world is facing many problems .
I &apos;ll just play some of them .
800 million people are hungry for bread .
One billion people don &apos;t have clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation solutions .
Millions of people die of AIDS .
And the list goes on .
The lives of about two billion people will change to the crops due to climate change , etc .
There are many , many problems in the world .
And in a perfect world , we would solve all of them , but we &apos;re not .
We don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And so the question we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why the talk belongs to the economics issue — is — if we don &apos;t solve all the problems , what problems do we need to solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;m facing you .
If we were to have 50 billion dollars for the next four years , surrounded by the world &apos;s improvement , what should we have invested them ?
We &apos;ve identified the top 10 challenges facing the world , and I &apos;ll go through them quickly . Climate change , infectious diseases , wars and conflict , education , economic instability , government corruption , hunger and malnutrition , refugees and mass migration , sanitation and water availability , and trade barriers .
We think that list includes the world &apos;s biggest problems .
The immediate question for you is what problems you have on your list .
And how can we start to solve them ?
But that &apos;s a problem .
That &apos;s the question we asked at a conference on a bus in January .
And it &apos;s problematic to ask people to focus only on problems .
Because we can &apos;t really solve problems .
The biggest problem in the world is that we &apos;re all mortality .
But on the other hand , we don &apos;t have the ability to solve it .
So the task is not to prioritize problems , but to prioritize the solutions that are there for problems .
And these will be — of course , the business starts to get tricky .
Climate problems will be the Kyoto protocol .
The solutions infectious diseases include clinics and mosquito networks .
Democrats and wars — U.N. peacekeeping forces , etc .
Something I &apos;d like you to do is , in 30 seconds , and I know it &apos;s an impossible task , to write what you think are the first priorities on the list .
And also — and this is the part where economics is hiding as a dog — to register what the things that shouldn &apos;t be at the top of the list .
What do you think should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please , take it 30 seconds , talk to those around you , and try to recall the high priorities and low on the list of solutions available to the world &apos;s biggest problems .
The most significant part of the process , which I &apos;d like to give you an opportunity to experience , but I only have 18 minutes , and I &apos;ve given you a significant part of my time .
It &apos;s going into the process itself and thinking about it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
I recommend you with the heat , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll have discussions about that later , thinking about how you can do this kind of worship .
And of course , you ask yourself , how has this kind of urge been done before ?
And one reason is that surplus can be a very unpleasant process .
And nobody wants to do it .
Of course , every organization would like to be on top of this list .
But every organization also didn &apos;t want to be at the top of the list .
And since there are many more places that are not the first place , than places that are the first place on the list , it just makes sense that you don &apos;t want to make a list like this .
We set up the U.N. almost 60 years ago , but we &apos;ve never made a list of all the things we can do in the world , and we asked , what are we going to do before ?
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t prefer , every decision is a preference , so we still prefer , just not publicly — and it &apos;s probably worse than prioritizing after we thought and discussed it .
So what I &apos;m actually saying is , for a long time we &apos;ve had a menu of possibilities .
There are many , many things you can do in the world , but so far we haven &apos;t had the prices and the periods .
We had no idea about them .
Imagine you &apos;re in a restaurant , and you get a huge menu , but you have no idea what the price of the store is .
You want to order pizza , but you have no idea how much it costs .
The price can be one dollar or 1,000 dollars .
It might be a family pizza , or a personal pizza .
We should know these things .
And that &apos;s exactly what Consensus Copenhagen is trying to do in practice , trying to prioritize these issues .
The process in which consensus Copenhagen was like this .
We &apos;ve done 30 economists in the world , three out of every field on the list .
So the three economists are on climate change .
Look at what we can do , what cost , and what benefits we can produce .
Similarly in infectious diseases .
Three of the best experts in the world ask , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do and what the results will be .
And so on .
We then did some of the world &apos;s most economists , eight of them , including Nobel laureates , in Copenhagen in May of 2004 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; dreams team . &quot; &quot; The University of Cambridge preferred to call them the disturbing realm of the economy .
It &apos;s a very good nickname in Europe , but not so much here in the United States .
And this group worked on the preferred list .
And you ask , why not economists ?
And of course I &apos;m very happy that you asked — ( Laughter ) because that &apos;s a great question .
The point is that if you wanted to know about malaria , you would ask an expert for malaria .
If you wanted to know about climate , you would ask an expert for climate .
But if you wanted to prioritize the two fields , you couldn &apos;t ask the experts themselves , because they don &apos;t do the priority .
That &apos;s the role of economists .
They &apos;re about the priority .
They &apos;re the ones that decide , a protective decision in a sense , what &apos;s at a high frequency , and what &apos;s in a low frequency and you can do afterwards .
So that &apos;s the list I want to share with you .
And of course you can read it on our website , and I have no doubt that we will discuss it during the day .
On the list there are bad projects that mean that for projects where every dollar you invest , you get less than a dollar back .
Also there are reasonable projects , good projects , and great projects .
And of course we need to start from the excellent projects .
I &apos;ll start with the end , so we &apos;ll end with the exquisite projects .
So these are the worst projects .
And as you can see , climate change is at the bottom of the list .
This location hits many people , and it &apos;s probably one of the places people tell me I should go and not go back .
But I want to talk about this issue with you , because it &apos;s intriguing .
Why is the subject at the bottom of the list ?
And I &apos;ll also go back to this during the talk , because it &apos;s probably one of the issues where there &apos;s a difference between my list and the list that you wrote .
The reason the group said Protocol Kyoto , or doing something like this , is a bad project , is that it &apos;s a very inefficient project .
The group didn &apos;t say global warming is not a real phenomenon .
Or it &apos;s not a serious problem .
But the group said that given the means that by us , we can do very little at very high cost .
What they &apos;ve shown us through economic models is that if everyone participates in Kyoto , it will cost the world 150 billion dollars a year .
And this is a very significant cost .
It &apos;s between two and three degrees of aid that the world gives developing countries every year .
But the improvement that &apos;s achieved will be relatively small .
All models show that Kyoto will reject warming in about six years in 2100 .
So the guy in Bangladesh who was flooded in 2100 , would only be flooded in 2106 .
And that &apos;s an improvement , but not a significant improvement .
The bottom line is that we spent a lot of money on a small improvement .
And just to have a framework for reference , according to the U.N. estimates , for half of that cost , that means about 75 billion dollars a year , we can solve all the fundamental problems in the world .
We can provide drinking water , sanitation , basic health care and education for every person on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to double bind for a very small improvement ?
Or invest half the cost and get an amazing improvement ?
And that &apos;s why climate change is a bad project .
We don &apos;t say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t .
We say that if we don &apos;t have , it &apos;s not the first priority .
The likely projects — and I &apos;m going to skip some of them , for diseases , the expansion of health care has been able to cross the threshold , because extension of basic health care is a great thing .
It will lead to a significant improvement , but very high cost .
This rating shows us what happens when you look at both sides of the equation .
The good projects have a lot of sanitation projects and water .
Because sanitation and water are particularly important , but they also require expensive infrastructure .
I want to show you the four highest preferences , which should be at least among the first solutions to do , when we talk about dealing with the problems in the world .
The fourth project in Tobo is malaria — dealing with malaria .
When two billion are infected with malaria every year , I mean 200 million .
And the cost of the disease may get closer to about one percent of GDP , every year in the infected countries .
If we spend about 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we can reduce that cost to half .
We can prevent half a million people from dying , and perhaps most important — we can prevent one billion people from dying every year .
A fact that will help them significantly overcome the other problems in their lives , and in the long run with global warming .
The third project in Tobo is promoting free trade .
Our models have shown that if we can promote free trade , and specifically reduce the subsidies in Europe and the United States , we can revive the global economy , and bring it to the incredible sum of 2,400 billion dollars a year . Some of them are half in the Third World .
The point is that we can spend between 200 and 300 million people living in poverty , in a very short time — between two and five years .
This is the third effort in Tokyo that we can do .
The second issue in Turbo is hunger and malnutrition .
Not malnutrition in the larger sense , but a very cheap way to deal with nutritional problems that come from lack of specific factors .
About half the world &apos;s population is suffering from iron deficit , zinc , Ed Witamin A.
If we spend about 12 billion dollars , we can achieve significant achievements in this problem .
That would be the second investment in the good .
And the best project is on HIV virus .
If we spend 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we can prevent 28 million people from becoming HIV-positive .
And also within this issue , we &apos;re focusing on . There are two different ways of dealing with HIV .
One is treatment , the other is prevention .
And also here , in a perfect world , we would invest in both of them .
But in a world where we don &apos;t invest in one nose , or at least don &apos;t do them particularly well , we have to ask ourselves what possibility of investing in the first place .
And expensive treatment in orders of magnitude versus prevention .
So we &apos;re actually focusing on the fact that we can achieve much more by focusing on prevention .
For the price that we invest , we can get a certain improvement through treatment , or ten times more by prevention .
So we choose to focus on prevention on treatment at least initially .
It &apos;s a thinking that forces her to focus on our priorities .
I &apos;m asking you to look at your preference and look , have you taken our list ?
Or have you come close ?
One of the fundamental issues is climate change .
A lot of people think we &apos;re not likely to do that .
We also need to deal with climate change , even because it &apos;s a huge , significant problem .
But it &apos;s important to remember , we &apos;re not taking care of all problems .
There are many , many problems in the world .
And I want to make sure that the problems we &apos;re focusing on are the right problems .
The issues we can bring to a significant improvement , not a small improvement .
Thomas Schuling , one of the dream team , expressed it well .
A very important detail to forget is that in 100 years , when climate change is fully interacting , the people in the world are going to be very rich than today .
The most pessimistic predictions of the United Nations .
A contract that at 2100 , the average person in the third world will be as rich as I am and you are today .
And in high probability , it will be twice as rich or four times as rich .
Of course we &apos;re getting richer .
But the point is that when we talk about saving or helping people in Bangladesh at 2100 , we &apos;re not dealing with poor Indians .
It &apos;s relatively wealthy .
And it &apos;s important to ask , do we want to invest a lot , and help a little richer , in 100 years from now ?
Or do we want to help poor really , today , in Bangladesh , who really need our help , and that we can help them cheaply ?
As Lehing put it — imagine you were a wealthy Chinese , as you would , or a wealthy Belivian , or a wealthy Congo seat in 2100 , thinking about 2005 , wondering , &quot; &quot; How strange they were so concerned to help me deal with climate change ; but worry so little about helping my grandfather , and his father , even though they were able to help them much more , and that they really needed this issue , I think we needed this issue .
Even if they hide the traditional way we saw this problem .
And of course the traditional way has come true because climate change is great .
Think about the movie &quot; &quot; The day after tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that it attracts people to see it , but don &apos;t watch the Guide &#91; The Tribon &#93; to cast Brad Pitt into his next movie , which is about cleaning up latrines in Tanzania . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just not going to be a photogenic movie .
So I think , in many ways , consensus Copenhagen and all the debate about global priorities is a protective for too boring problems .
He makes sure that we remember that the goal is not to make ourselves feel good .
And not to address problems that get broader media coverage , but to invest in issues where we can bring significant improvement .
Another common resistance , which is important to mention , suggests that you can &apos;t really choose one on the other .
And we had to address all the problems , and in a perfect world , I would agree with a whole heart .
I also think we have to address all the problems , but we don &apos;t do that .
In 1970 , the developed world decided to invest twice as much as we &apos;re investing today in aid to developing countries .
Since the scale of our aid has exploded in half .
So we &apos;re not in the right direction if we want to solve all the world &apos;s problems .
Another argument is about war in Iraq .
We spend 100 billion dollars on it . Why don &apos;t we invest that money in improving the world ?
I &apos;m for the idea .
And if anyone here can convince Bush to give it to it , great .
But the principle doesn &apos;t change — even if we get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to invest them in the best way , isn &apos;t it ?
The fundamental thing is to reconcile ourselves , and to consolidate the right priorities .
I just want to address the question of whether we &apos;re safe on our list .
Because when you ask the world &apos;s leading economists , it &apos;s inevitably a group of white and old Americans .
And this is Leo actually the best view of looking through the world .
So we invited 80 young people from around the world , and we asked them to do the same work .
The only requirements were that they were students , and they were English speakers .
Most of them came from developing countries .
They worked with the same data , but they could expand the discussion to other issues , and they did do so to get their own list .
And the big surprise was that the lists were very similar , with malnutrition and disease at the top of the list , and climate change at the bottom .
We repeated the process many times .
We had workshops with university students , and other meetings .
And we &apos;ve always reached a very similar list .
And it fills me with hope and belief that there is a way to start thinking about the right priorities , and that you can ask , &quot; What &apos;s important to do in the world ? &quot;
And of course , in a perfect world , we were happy to do everything .
But since we don &apos;t do everything , we have to think about what to do first .
I think consensus Copenhagen is a process .
We started it in 2004 , and we hope to attract a lot of people , and get better information towards 2008 and 2012 .
You map the right path to the world , and also think about how you do political performance imagination .
To be used to say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not do the things we gain very little cost , not do the things we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the things we can achieve tremendous improvement , low cost , already . &quot; &quot; In the bottom row , you might not agree with the results of preference and discussion that led to them , but we should be honest with himself , and because there are things we do , and things we don &apos;t do .
If we try to address certain issues , we don &apos;t necessarily address some of the other issues .
So I hope this process will help us prioritize better , and think about how we can work better in the world .
Thank you .
The year is 1800 .
You talk about a little invention that makes curiosity .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
It allows you to see tiny life-forms hidden from the normal eye .
Soon after that comes the medical discovery that many of these life-forms are the cause of terrible diseases in humans .
Think about what happens in society when you find out that Mother Angola had a tea from her tea soup containing monsters , not far from here . The picture from London .
Fast forward 200 years .
We still have the monster soup , and it thrives in the developing countries around the tropical strip .
Just because of malaria , there are a million deaths every year , and more than a billion people and women need diagnosis because they &apos;re at risk of disease in different depths of malaria .
It &apos;s actually very simple to recognize many of these monsters .
You take a variety , for example , a chemical compound in orange , or you take a fluorescent or a Jamaica , and a microscope , and you look at them .
All of them can be identified .
So why is Alex in Kenya , Fatma in Bangladesh , Najmutt in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda , still waiting many months for diagnosis to tell them the cause of their illness ?
It happens mainly because the standing in demand for diagnostics is outside of reach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem is accelerated in the microscope itself .
Although it &apos;s the top of modern science , the research microscope is not built to use open space .
They were never designed in the first place for diagnostics at all .
They &apos;re heavy , diculous , hard to reproduce , and they cost a lot of money .
In this picture , Mahatma Gandhi in the 1940s uses the same device that we use today , to an tuberculosis diagnosis in Swakham in India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , were walking around in India and Thailand , and they started thinking deeply about the problem .
We saw gear donated from all kinds .
We &apos;ve seen glowing mushrooms on the lens of a microscope .
We saw people who had a microscope but didn &apos;t even know how to turn it on .
What emerged from that work and that journey was the idea that we call a folding microscope .
What is a folding microscope ?
This is a microscope for everything , the theme of light , which is bright , polarized , transparent and all kinds of microscopic useful that were built just out of paper folds .
Now you say , how is this possible ?
I &apos;ll show you some examples , and we &apos;ll go through them .
It starts with a single sheet of paper .
What you see here is all the components you need to build a bright , bright microscope on a light that works .
Here are the three components : there &apos;s the optical component , the light component and the device for the models .
And there &apos;s the microoptics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
What you do is you take it and you kind of play in a toy , and it really is , you release it , you break it down .
There are no instructions here and no use of language .
There &apos;s code , the code is embedded by color , which tells us exactly how to fold the microscope .
When you finish , it looks something like this , it has everything that &apos;s in a regular microscope , like a two-dimensional motion surface , a place where the sample surface will sit , for example right here .
We didn &apos;t want to change it , because it &apos;s a fiscal thing that has reached perfection over the years , and the health care people are used to it .
That &apos;s what has changed , but the normal contribution remains the same as it is for different diseases .
You put it in .
There &apos;s the two-dimensional mechanism phase , and then there &apos;s the focus phase , which is the built wing mechanism within the paper itself and allows us to move and focus the lenses in the boundaries of microbes .
What &apos;s most interesting about this product , and my students hate me doing this , but I will do anyway , these are devices that can be recorded .
You can flip them and throw them on the floor and walk on them .
And they hold on , even though they &apos;re made out of a very flexible material like paper .
Another funny fact is that we send them as a standard diagnostic tool , but within this envelope there are 30 microscopes that fold , in different forms , all in the same envelope .
I &apos;ll pick one randomly .
This , it turns out , is particularly designed for malaria , because it has the light filters built specifically for the malaria diagnosis .
So the idea of dedicated microscopes to different diagnostics comes from this .
Until now , you haven &apos;t really seen what you can see in one of these forms .
So what I want to do , if you can dim the lights please , it turns out that microscopes fold up are also microscopes that radiate .
I have two microscopes here and an activist — I &apos;ll go behind the wall — and I &apos;ll play , that &apos;s exactly what I see .
What you see here — ( Applause ) This is a cross-section of a complex eye , and when I get close to it , I &apos;m moving on the y-axis .
You can actually see how the lenses are cut in the pattern of the rotten incision .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , likes to hate it , a mosquito , you see the sense of cholera .
Here we go .
It &apos;s all through the simple structure that I described .
My wife used to look at some of our microscopes during my clothing washing every time I forget them dry .
So it turns out they &apos;re resistant in the water , ( Laughter ) There &apos;s glamorous water here , I don &apos;t know if you can see it .
This shows you how the projection device works .
You can see the foundation , how it &apos;s fragmented and bending .
Can we turn the lights on ?
I &apos;m going to show you quickly , because the time is over , how much it costs us to make . The brilliant idea was to create a continuous process on a film , so we created it from parts of 50 cents .
( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is think about a new way of working with a microscope , which we call the &quot; &quot; used microscopic &quot; &quot; and green .
So I &apos;m going to show you a quick snippet of some of the parts that make this up .
This is a sheet of paper .
That &apos;s when we thought about the idea .
This is A4 paper .
These are the three steps that you see .
And the optical components , if you look at the addition up on the right , we had to find a way to make lenses within the paper itself at a very high rate , using the process of self-assembly and facial tension to build color-free lenses inside the paper itself .
That &apos;s where the lenses sit .
There are some light sources .
And in particular , at the end of all the parts get along because of the paper folds , because of the fact that the folds allow us to have optical precision at the scale of microbes .
So even though it looks like a simple toy , the engineering aspects associated with this kind of thing are quite complex .
Here &apos;s another obvious thing that we would do . If I had to show you that these microscopes are tough and resilient , I would go up to the third floor and throw them away .
So here we did , and they held on .
So for us , the next step is to finish the surface testing .
Let &apos;s start at the end of the summer .
We &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re going to make thousands of microscopes .
This will be the first time we do land experiments with the highest density of microscopes ever had in one place .
We started collecting data on malaria , Chase and Jardia , from the patients themselves .
And finally I want to show you this picture .
I didn &apos;t expect it before , but it &apos;s a very interesting link between education and science and global health .
What are the tools that we actually provide for children to go to deal tomorrow with Mark the monsters ?
I &apos;d really like to be able to print them a follow-up microscopic that could carry them in their pockets anywhere .
Thank you .

In our world there are many superheroes .
But they have the worst superpower : invisible .
For example , the hecdores , workers who collect materials for habitat .
Catords come from inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of solid waste from the efficiency of the waste collection system .
Katuras provide a very , very vital work and a gift that &apos;s beneficial to the whole population , but you don &apos;t know them about it .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s recycled .
Most hectares work independently , collect waste from the streets and sell to ghettos in very low prices .
They might gather over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and Croses .
Croses are efficacy that are in wood or metal and are in some streets in Brazil , just like graffiti and street art .
And so I first met these unappreciated superheroes .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist and my art is social , environmental and political artist in nature .
In 2007 , I took my job beyond the walls and into the Carsas , as a new urban support for my message .
But at the same time , giving voice to the cathedrus .
By adding art and humor to purpose , it became more attractive , which helped attract attention to Kataras and improve their self-esteem .
And also , they &apos;re famous now on the streets , on media and on social media .
So the thing is , I was diving into this world and I didn &apos;t stop working ever since .
I &apos;ve painted over 200 Croses in many cities and I &apos;ve been invited to make exhibitions and travel all over the world .
And then I realized that the hecdores , in their invisibility , not exclusive only to Brazil .
I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even developed countries like the United States and Japan .
And then I realized that I needed more people to join the goal because it &apos;s a big challenge .
And then , I created a collaborative movement called that ranged my membrane — ( Laughter ) — which is a big mass event .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So upgraded my version is a big crowd-funded event to help Kataras and their Croses .
Katuras get aid from health professionals and medicine , like family doctors , dentists , leg doctors , hair designers , massists and much more .
But , they also get safety shirts , gloves , glasses raincoat to see the city in high resolution , while their Croses are being bombed by incredible volunteers .
And if they also get safety zones : reflectors of light , claws and mirrors .
So , finally , fingers by street artists and become part of a huge mobility exhibit .
That ranked my collapse went to the streets of San Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Korajeva .
But to meet demand in other cities , including outside Brazil , we created Pimpx , inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s simplified , dared it yourself , that upgraded my collapse in mass funding .
So now everybody can join .
In the two years , over 170 Katuras , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and over 1,000 donors were involved in the movement that ranged my collapse , that their actions were used to teach cycle in a local school .
So Katuras leaves the invisible behind and become more valued and valuable .
Because of their matched Croses , they &apos;re able to fight injustice , increase their income and their communication with society .
So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking and acknowledge the basketball and heroic about other invisible in your city .
Try to see the world as one , without borders or schools .
Believe it or not , there are more than 20 million hectares in the world .
So the next time you see one , recognize it as a vital part of our society .
Multo Obrigado , thank you .

About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 about Virtual Earth brought me here to be the architect of Being Maps , which is the investment of Microsoft in online mapping .
Over the past two and a half years , we &apos;ve been working very hard on redefining the way maps work online .
And we really think about it in other terms of the kind of fancy website and the intention that everyone is used to .
So , the first thing you might notice on the mapping site is just the slides of the horror and the neglect , and if you know the Sadagon , that &apos;s its source .
Mapping , of course , isn &apos;t just about cartography , it &apos;s also about photographic information .
So , while we zoom beyond a certain level it becomes something similar to a virtual perspective at 45 degrees .
You can look at it from all the main directions to show you the three-dimensional structure of the city , all the fronts .
Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment as if there was a painting on it that you could present all kinds of applications , and the directions of looking at the map are really just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the applications that we &apos;ve put , just in the last few months , since we &apos;ve been silenced .
So , for example , a few days after the disaster in Haiti , we had a earthquake map that showed air shots of before and after .
( app ) This wonderful thing that I don &apos;t have time to introduce you to take very local blogs in real time and map these stories , these values to places that are attributed to them in a blog .
That &apos;s great .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more cute things .
So , we see , of course , the images don &apos;t end up in the air .
These green bubbles represent photosynthesis that users have created .
I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but Potosynthesis is integrated into the map .
All that &apos;s reflected in blue is an area where we took photographs from the ground as well .
And then , when you fly down . ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down , down to the ground , and you see this kind of anonymous photograph , the first thing you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a photograph , there &apos;s a 3D understanding of the environment at least as much as there is in the upper dimensional city , so if I click on something to get a closer look at it , then the fact that the transition looks like it looks , it &apos;s a one-dimensional model , that &apos;s this geometry .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a fun app that we &apos;ve been working on in collaboration with our friends in Flickr .
It takes pictures from Flickr with information about geographic location and uses similar processes to Potosynthesis to connect these images to our photographs , so — I &apos;m not sure if this is the one I really meant to pull out , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are many images in this area and these images taken in different times .
So , this was taken about five .
So , this is the picture from Flickr , this is our shot .
So you really see how this kind of image from a integrated community source , in a very profound way , within the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why it &apos;s interesting and one of them , of course , is a journey in time .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historical footage here , but there are some with horses and trains and so on .
But what &apos;s great about this , it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s the enrichment of this visual presentation of the world with things coming from users , but it &apos;s also the foundations of an augmented reality , and that &apos;s something I &apos;ll show you more about in a moment .
Now I just moved into a building . It &apos;s also interesting .
All right , notice there &apos;s a roof right now above us .
We &apos;re in the Players market .
And this is something we can do with a camera carried in a backpack , so , we &apos;re not just photographing in the street with this camera on the roof of the cars , but we &apos;re photographing inside as well .
And from here , we can do the same kind of match not just for the cyberspace , but also of video .
So this is something we &apos;re going to try now for the first time , in a live broadcast , and it &apos;s really , really , very scary .
( Laughter ) All right .
( Singing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
( Noise ) All right , I click on that . I click the shoe .
I &apos;m in live entertainment . Okay . Here it comes .
So , these are our friends in the Pick Players market , the lab .
( Applause ) So they transmit it in a live broadcast .
All right , George , can you steer the camera back to the corner of the market ?
Because I want to show some interesting points .
No , no . The other way .
Yes , yes . Back to the corner . Back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you yet .
All right , all right . Back to the corner . Back to the corner . Back to the corner .
All right , forget about that .
What I wanted to show you are these points of interest here on the photography because what it enables you is to get a sense of the way , if you &apos;re right at the point — you can think about it — is to take a step further beyond the augmented reality .
What the hell are you — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We do two different things — OK , I &apos;m paralyzed now .
We do two different things here .
One of them is to take reality ...
( Laughter ) All right , let me have a moment to thank the team .
They did a wonderful job to pick it up together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to leave them now and go back out .
And as I go out , I &apos;ll just point out that here , we use it for remotely posture , but it &apos;s equally possible to use it in its own place , to a more sophisticated reality .
When you use it in its own place , it means you can bring all the metadata and information about the world — to you .
So here , we take the other step and we transmit it .
It &apos;s broadcast , by the way , on a fourth generation network out of the market .
All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED Talk that Microsoft has spent the last few years .
And this is a Weng Telescope , a global telescope .
So , we &apos;re going to go to the waste capacity where it &apos;s traditionally driven , after a long day in the market , go out to the break , but also watch the sky .
This is the combination of the global telescope into our maps .
( Applause ) This is the time — thank you — this is the current time , but if we move the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all the very detailed information about different times , different dates . Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
I want to do something like zoom in on the moon .
So , this is a whole astronomical representation of the sky integrated directly into the Earth .
All right now , I &apos;ve dragged my time , so I have to stop .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
Today I &apos;m going to tell you two things . One is what we &apos;ve lost , and the other , how to reclaim .
Let me start with this .
This is my baseline . This is the Mediterranean coast without fish , exposed rocks and lots of sea frogs that love to eat the algae .
That &apos;s kind of what I saw when I jumped for the first time in the water on the Mediterranean coast near Spain .
If a alien came to Earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe was diving in a coral reef , this alien would see a lot of things .
It &apos;s unlikely that Joe was diving in a pure coral reef , a submarine coral reef with lots of corals , sharks , crocodiles , rivers , bears , turtles and so on .
What Joe would probably see was here , in the greener part of the picture .
We have an extreme situation here with dead corals , just of bacteria and jellyfish .
And wherever the diver is , this is now the situation in most reefs in the world , with very few corals , a algae that grows on them , lots of bacteria , and after all the big animals disappeared .
And that &apos;s what most marine scientists have seen as well .
This is their baseline . This is what they think the natural situation is , because we started doing modern science , with diving equipment , long after we started to disrupt marine ecosystems .
So now I &apos;m going to take everyone at a time machine , go to the left and go to the past to see how the sea used to be .
Let &apos;s activate the time machine . This is the Line Islands , where we conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
This sea is a group of islands that belongs to Kiribati , and it &apos;s rooted on the equator , some of the islands are not inhabitable , and they don &apos;t deal with fish . Islands in the margins . There are some inhabitable islands .
Let &apos;s start on Sunday , Christmas island — over 5,000 people .
Most reefs die . Most corals die , the algae grows wild , and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils that use us to count them .
We &apos;ve accumulated 250 hours of dive in 2005 .
We didn &apos;t even see one shark .
This is where Captain Coke discovered in 1777 , and he described a huge abundance of sharks who had pulled the protectors and judgments of their little boats as they were on the beach .
Let &apos;s turn the dial a little bit further .
The island of Panning , 2,500 residents .
The corals are better here . Lots of little fish .
For many divers , I think , this is heaven .
This can be seen in most of the national reserve parts in the Florida Falcon Islands .
And many people think it &apos;s really , really nice , if it &apos;s your baseline .
If we go back in time to a place like Al Female , where I visited Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are better off , and there are sharks .
You can see sharks every single dive .
And this is a very unusual event in the coral reefs today .
But again , if we turn the dial around and go back in 200 or 500 years , we &apos;re going to go to places where the corals are completely healthy and wonderful , creating amazing structures , and where predators are the most striking thing , and you can see between 25 and 50 sharks every night .
What have we learned from these places ?
That &apos;s what we thought to be natural .
This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
If we collect and weigh all the fish in a coral reef , that &apos;s what we would expect .
The biomass business is low in the food chain , these are the plants , the fish fish , the beards that eat the algae .
From them , the plankton eaters , these little blue coral , the little animals floating in the water .
And then we have a smaller biomass of meat eaters , and biomass is smaller at the top , and these are the sharks , the big predators , the big hackers .
But that &apos;s the result .
This view of the world is the result of navigated reef exploration .
When we got to divergence , we realized that the natural world behaves upside down ; the pyramid is the other way around .
The pyramid Union is responsible for most of the biomass , at certain levels to 85 percent like the Kingman reef , which is now protected .
The good news is that , apart from having more predators , there &apos;s also more than anything .
The size of these pieces is larger .
We have more sharks , more biomass of predators , and also more biomass of plant food , like these fish fish , which are like seawater .
They clean up the reefs from whatever &apos;s grown and bigger enough to look , they eat and keep the reef cleaning and allow corals to regenerate .
It &apos;s not only that these places , ancient places and these worms contain lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem , like giant oysters , a huge floating of oysters in the lagoon , about 20 , 25 square meters .
These disappeared from all the unpopulated reefs in the world , and they filter the water : they keep the water cleaning from bacteria and pathogens .
But we now have global warming .
If there &apos;s no fishing because the law protects these reefs , or because they &apos;re distant , it &apos;s great .
But the water heats up for too long and the corals die .
So how could these fish , how could these predators help ?
Well , what we &apos;ve seen is that in this particular area , at Al Nino time , &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too hot for too long , and many corals blew and many of them died .
On Christmas Islands , where very little of the food fabric , and the big animals disappeared , the corals didn &apos;t recover .
On the island of Panning , the corals didn &apos;t recover .
But here you see a big table coral that died and collapsed .
And the fish will forget the algae , so the middle of the algae is slightly lower .
Now we &apos;re going to move to a flambula that has more biomass of plants , and the corals here are clean , and the corals are getting better .
And as you go to the submersible side , is it ever the Lambin ?
These places also blew , but they recovered quickly .
The less damaged it is , the more complete it is , the more your food chain is complex , the more flexible it is , the more likely the system is to recover from the short-term effects of the warming events .
And that &apos;s good news . That &apos;s why we have to restore the structure .
We need to make sure that all the pieces of the ecosystem are embedded in place , so that the ecosystem can adapt to global warming effects .
So we need to reset the baseline , if we need to push the ecosystem back to left , and how can we do that ?
There are several ways .
One of the obvious ways is the protected areas , especially the &quot; &quot; don &apos;t spend &quot; &quot; reserves that we closed , to allow the rehabilitation of marine life .
Let me go back to this picture of the Mediterranean Sea .
This was my baseline . This is what I saw as a child .
And then I also looked at Jack Cousteau programs on television , all the wealth and abundance and diversity .
And I thought then that this wealth was in the tropics , and what the Mediterranean Sea is inherently thick .
And I really had no idea , until I first dive in a marine reserve .
And this is what I saw : a lot of fish .
A few years later , between five and seven years , the fish come back , eat the sea floor , and the algae grows again .
So at first there are small algae plants , and in the area that &apos;s as large as a laptop , you can find over 100 species of algae , especially microscopic creatures , hundreds of fish , small animals that feed the fish , so the system can recover .
And this particular place , the aquatic reserve of the Madas Islands , is only 940 acres , and it puts six million euros into the local economy , 20 times more than the fish , and these are 88 percent of the income screen from tourism .
So these places are helping not only the ecosystem , but also for humans who can benefit from the ecosystem .
Let me summarize for you what does the &quot; &quot; don &apos;t spend &quot; &quot; teacher do .
These places , when we protect them , when you compare them to unprotected areas , that &apos;s what happens .
The number of species goes up by 21 percent , so if you have 1,000 species , you &apos;re likely to have another 200 .
It &apos;s a very significant tumor .
The size of organisms increases in a third , so the fish are now this big .
The abundance , the amount of fish per square meter , goes up almost 170 percent .
And biomass — and this is the most fascinating change — 4.5 times more biomass , on average , after five to seven years .
Some places have 10 times more biomass inside the reserves .
So we have all these things growing in a reserve , and what do they do ?
They breed . It &apos;s the United States of biology .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a long time to die , and they grow and grow very much .
And so are the non-vertebrates . Here &apos;s an example .
This is a pair of eggs that lay a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is the amount of eggs they drove on the bottom .
Outside the reserve , you can &apos;t even notice it .
1.3 million eggs per square meter in the marine reserve , where there &apos;s plenty of snails .
So these organisms breed . There &apos;s a body of young larvae , there &apos;s a temple across the reserve boundaries , and humans can benefit from them as well .
This is the Bahamas Islands , this is Ducker São .
A huge amount of fish in this reserve , and as you get closer to the reserve , there &apos;s more fish .
So fishermen get more .
You can see where the boundary is , according to the line of boats .
So there &apos;s a temple here . There are benefits beyond the parenting boundaries that benefit people around , and at the same time , the reserve protects the entire habitat ; it produces resilience .
And what we have now , or in other words , a world without reserves is like a minus account that we are constantly drawn away from , and we never focus on .
The reserves are like savings accounts .
We have a foundation in which we don &apos;t touch , and that puts social , economic and ecological returns .
And if you think about the increase in biomass within the reserves , it &apos;s an architectural interest .
Two more examples , how these reserves can be useful for humans .
It &apos;s the amount that fishermen manage to fish every day in Kenya , a fish that lasted several years , where there &apos;s no protection ; it &apos;s for everyone .
Once the major deterioration of the fish , not the sales , Sollock , the fisheries have fish more .
If fish are less , they actually get more .
But if you add the &quot; &quot; nothing to spend , &quot; &quot; the fishermen earn even more by fish less around the protected area .
Another example : Dear went to the faucet in the Mos-American reef .
It &apos;s sex between the fisheries . The researchers get together when the moon is full of December and January for a week .
They would go to tens of thousands , 30,000 fisheries of this size , on 10 acres in one group .
The fishermen knew about it ; they fish them , and they pasted them .
When I first got there in 2000 , there were only 3,000 fisheries left .
And fishermen were allowed to fish 30 percent of all the population that had been served every year .
We did a simple analysis , and you don &apos;t have to be very smart to understand that if you take 30 percent every year , the fish will disappear very quickly .
And yet it will capture the capacity of reproduction of the whole species .
It happened in many places in the Caribbean Sea .
And they would make 4,000 dollars a year , just for the entire fishing , a few fishing boats .
If you do economic analysis , and try to predict what would happen if the fishery wasn &apos;t destroyed , if we only brought 20 divers for one month a year , the income would be more than 20 times , and over time it would become sustainable .
So how much of this do we actually have ?
If it &apos;s so good and simple , how much of it do we have ?
And you &apos;ve heard that less than one percent of the ocean is protected .
We &apos;re now approaching one percent due to defending the Chagos Islands group , and only a fraction of it is fully protected from fishing .
Scientific studies suggest that at least 20 percent of the sea will be protected .
The gap is between 20 and 50 percent about a series of goals associated with biodiversity and improving fishing and increasing adaptability .
Is it possible ? People ask : How much will it cost ?
Let &apos;s think : How much are we paying at the fishing secret right now . 35 billion dollars a year .
Many of these subsidies are going to become destructive fishing methods .
There are some estimates about how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas that cover 20 percent of the ocean and it would be just a fraction of what we pay today , the engineers that governments give the branch of the fish collapsing .
People lose their job because fishing zones collapse .
Creating a network of reserves will provide direct employment for more than a million people in addition to all of the secondary jobs and unique benefits .
How do we do that ?
If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are both good for the environment and for humans , why don &apos;t there be 20 , 50 percent of the sea ?
How do we get to that destination ?
There are two ways to get there .
The simple solution is to create very large protected areas like Archipelago Chagos .
The problem is that we can create these big names only in places where there are no people , there are no social conflicts , and where the political price is low , and also the economic costs .
And some of us , some organizations in this room and other places work on this .
But what about the rest of the world &apos;s beaches , where people live or are making a fishing break ?
There are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of little reserves . The first is that people have no idea what the marine reserves do , and the fishermen tend to defend when it comes to regulation or closing a region , even a small mother .
Second , there is no right administration because most of the coastal communities around the world have authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and protect it .
It &apos;s a hierarchical and bureaucratic structure , where people are waiting for government officials to come , and it &apos;s not efficient , it &apos;s also government that doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
And that brings us to the third reason . Why don &apos;t we have much more reserves , that &apos;s because the models of finance were wrong .
NGOs and governments spend a lot of time , energy and resources to very few and small areas , usually .
So conservation and coastal protection has become a sewage for governments and donors , and it &apos;s not sustainable .
So the solutions are to fix these three problems .
First of all , we need to develop a partnership of global awareness that will inspire local communities and governments to establish &quot; don &apos;t spend &quot; &quot; better than the ones we have now .
It &apos;s about savings accounts versus accounts without any commandment .
Secondly , we need to redesign our governance so that conservation efforts can be distributed , so that conservation efforts won &apos;t rely on the work of NGOs or government agencies , and they can be done in the local community like the Philippines and some other places .
And thirdly , and most importantly , we need to develop new business models .
The burning of contributions as the only means of creating reserves is not sustainable .
We need to develop models , business models , where coastal preservation is in investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
And I want to end with one more thought , which is that no single organization will save the ocean .
Once upon a time there was a lot of competition , and we needed to develop a new model of partnerships , of real collaboration , where the bodies would pay each other , and they wouldn &apos;t act instead .
The risks are just too high for us to continue the way we go .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you , Anick .
Anick Salais : Thank you .
CA : It was a thought craftsmanship of connecting the pieces of the puzzle .
First , your pyramid , the reverse pyramid , which shows 85 percent biomass of predators , it seems impossible .
How can 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
ES : Well , describe to yourself that you have two cogs of watch , one big and one small one .
The big rotates very slowly , and the small — fast .
That &apos;s basically the thing .
The animals in the lower parts of the food chain , reproduce very quickly , grow very fast and eliminate millions of eggs .
At the top , there are big sharks and fish that live 25 , 30 years .
They breed very slowly . Their metabolism is very slow , and in fact they only sustain their biomass .
So basically , the folks &apos;s culture preferences are down there pretty much to have this biomass that &apos;s not in motion .
They &apos;re like receiving an electric system .
CA : It &apos;s very fascinating .
So actually the picture we have on the food pyramid is simple — we have to completely change it .
ES : At least in the sea .
We found that in the coral reefs , the reverse pyramid is equivalent to Srangti , with five lions for all of us .
And on land it can &apos;t work .
But at least coral reefs are systems that have structural underwear vehicles .
We think it &apos;s universal .
But we &apos;ve started studying submarines very recently .
CA : The numbers you &apos;ve presented are really amazing .
You say we spend 35 billion dollars on subsidies .
It only takes 16 billion dollars to build 20 percent of the ocean as protected marine areas . It actually gives new choices for fishermen as well .
If the world was smarter , we would solve this problem at the risk of 19 billion dollars .
And we got 19 billion dollars to spend on health care and so on .
ES : And we have the lower performance problem of fisheries looking at 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the great solutions is that the World Trade Organization will move the subsidies to sustainable methods .
CA : All right . I hear a lot of examples about the madness of the secret .
So thank you for those numbers .
And last question , personally .
There &apos;s a lot of experience in this audience here of people who have been in the ocean for a long time and have seen this decline , the places that used to be beautiful in their hearts . It &apos;s depressing .
Tell me about the emotions you should have when you &apos;ve been visiting these wormland and seeing things go wrong .
ES : It &apos;s a spiritual experience .
We went out there to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or map fish and sharks and see what these places are different than the ones we know .
But the best feeling , though , is the biophylia that Willson talks about , the sense of appearance and wonder that people are experiencing in the face of the non-Olympic nature , the wild nature .
And there , and just there , you feel that you &apos;re really part of something bigger , or part of a global ecosystem .
And to fill those places that offer some hope , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve been able to continue my work .
It was just too depressing .
CA : Well , Eric , thank you very much for sharing some of these spiritual experiences . Thank you .
AS : Thank you very much .
Well this year is 1995 , I &apos;m in college , my friend and I go on a road trip from Robbidens , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
And you know , we &apos;re young and we &apos;re not working , so we &apos;re doing all of this in sideways through national parks and forests — basically the longest route we can do .
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that sparked me for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What &apos;s the story with the Chinese sign that I see all the time on the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks at me at a completely closed look .
There &apos;s actually a man in the front row who does a perfect imitation of her vision .
( Laughter ) And I say , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs that we see all the time with the Chinese cursor that &apos;s on them . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s been looking at me for a while , and then she just explodes laughter , because she &apos;s understanding what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I talked about was this .
( Laughter ) Yeah , the famous Chinese marker for the Pickinic region . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years in my life thinking about situations like this exactly — why sometimes we don &apos;t understand the symbols around us , and how we behave when it happens , and what all this can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as you &apos;ve heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being accidentally wrong .
It might show you as a strange career to choose , but actually there &apos;s one big advantage in it : there are no competition at work .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us will do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
We understand it abstract .
We all know everyone in this room makes mistakes .
The human species , in general , can accomplish — OK , good .
But when it comes to me right now , all the beliefs I hold , here in present time , all of a sudden this abstract appreciation of being able to get out of the window — and I can &apos;t actually think about one thing that I &apos;m driving about .
And the thing is , the present is the time we live .
We go to meetings in present time , we go on family vacations in present time . We go to the polls and vote in present time .
So , in fact , in a way , we all go through our lives , locked in a small bubble where we feel right about everything .
I think that &apos;s a problem .
I think this is a problem for each of us as individuals , in our private and professional lives , and I think this is a problem for all of us together as a culture .
So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we &apos;re stuck in this sense of being right .
Second , why is that such a problem ?
And finally , I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to get out of that feeling , and that if you can do that , it &apos;s the biggest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can do .
So why are we stuck in this sense that we are right ?
One reason has to do with the feeling of being accidental .
So folks let me ask you something — or actually , let me ask you something , because you &apos;re right here : what does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel wrong ?
Horrible . failure .
embarrassing . Okay , great , good .
Awesome , failure , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but these are answers to a different question .
You guys answered the question : How does it feel when you realize you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) The realization that we &apos;re wrong may feel that way and many other things , right ?
I mean it might be destructive , it might be an epiphany , it might be funny , like my stupid Chinese marker error .
But just mistake doesn &apos;t make any sense .
I &apos;m going to show you an analogy .
Do you remember the cartoon character of the pathetic coat who is always chasing but never grabbing the bird ?
More or less in every chapter of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment when the coat chases the bird and the bird runs across the cliff , and that &apos;s okay , it &apos;s a bird , it can fly .
But the thing is , the concept runs beyond the cliff right after the bird .
And the funny thing — at least when you &apos;re six years old — is that the nightmare is also fine .
He just keeps running — just up until the moment he looks down and realizes he &apos;s up in the air .
So it falls .
When we &apos;re wrong with something — not when we understand it , but before — we &apos;re like the same coat after he passed the end of the cliff and before he looked down .
You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
So I have to actually fix something I said a moment ago .
We really have a sense when we &apos;re wrong : the feeling is that we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s one reason , structural reason , why we &apos;re stuck in the feeling that we &apos;re right .
I call it wrong blindness .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal marker to know us that we &apos;re wrong about anything , until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s also a second reason that we &apos;re stuck in that feeling — and that one is cultural .
Think for a moment about the past in primary school .
You &apos;re sitting in a classroom , and your teacher is holding a check page , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
( Laughter ) So here you are in elementary school , and you know exactly what to think about the child who received that test .
This is the silly kid , who gets in trouble , is that he never makes homework .
So by the time you were nine years old , you already learned , first of all , that people who make mistakes are lazy , who are so irresponsible — and second , the way to succeed in life is never to achieve .
We learn these bad lessons really well .
And many of us — and I have a suspicion , that many of us in this room — are dealing with them simply by making them excellent , fractal , hyper-achievement students .
Right , the CEO sir , the astrophysicist , the ultrasmanian run ?
( Laughter ) It turns out you &apos;re all CEOs , astrophysicists , ultrasmanian runners .
Okay , so okay .
Except that we &apos;re going down the awards from the possibility that we &apos;ve wrong with something .
Because , according to that , mistake something means something &apos;s wrong with us .
So we &apos;re just standing on that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel intelligent , responsible and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A few years ago , a woman &apos;s surgery came in at the University of Israel Medical Center .
Israel &apos;s house in Boston .
This is Harvard Medical School — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
She &apos;s commissioned , the surgeon does his own — flip her back , send her to the recovery room .
It seems to be okay .
When she wakes up and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body wearing ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is wearing because the surgeon did a significant operation on the left leg rather than on the right .
When the President &apos;s President of Medicine of Medicine at Israel talked about this incident , he said a very interesting thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; For some reason , the surgeon just felt that he was on the right side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point in this story is that security is too much sense that we are on the right side of the thing might be very dangerous .
The sense of intrinsic justice that we all try so often is not a way of trusting what &apos;s actually happening in the outside world .
And when we act as though it is , and we stop playing around thinking we might be wrong , well then we find ourselves doing things like pouring 750 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or disturbing the global economy .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
That means you think your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
And when you feel that , you have a problem to solve , which is , how do you explain all those people who disagree with you ?
Turns out , most of us explain these people in a similar way , using a series of miserable assumptions .
The first thing we usually do when someone doesn &apos;t agree with us is just assume it &apos;s broken .
It doesn &apos;t have the access to the same information that we have , and when we share with it carefully , it will see the light and move to our side .
When it doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that those people have all the same facts that we have and they still disagree with us , we move to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re stupid .
( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces in the puzzle , but they &apos;re too big to get them right .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us hold all the facts and actually are quite intelligent , we go to a third assumption : they know the truth , and on purpose they distort it for their malware purposes .
So this is a disaster .
The relations to our needs stop us from stopping mistakes when we absolutely have to do that and make us treat each other horribly .
But for me what &apos;s most confusing and most tragic about this is that it misses the main point of being human .
It &apos;s as though we want to imagine that our consciousness is just a perfect transparent window and we &apos;re just looking through it and illuminating the world as it unfolds .
And we want everyone to look through the same window and see the exact same thing .
It &apos;s not real , and if it was , life was really boring .
The miracle of our consciousness is not that we see the world as it is .
But we see the world as we don &apos;t .
We remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be another person somewhere else .
And we all do it a little bit differently , and that &apos;s why we can look up to that skyscraper to me and see that and that too .
And yes , that &apos;s also why we &apos;re wrong .
1,200 years before Deckett said his famous saying about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , the Holy Augustine , sat and wrote &quot; &quot; Faller Argo Block &quot; &quot; — &quot; I &apos;m wrong with therefore I am . &quot;
Augustine realized that our ability to cook is not a kind of embarrassing flaw in the human method , something that can be eradicated or overcome .
It &apos;s absolutely fundamental to who we are .
Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
And apart from all other animals , we &apos;re chased by trying to figure it out .
For me , this pursuit is the source and roots of all our productivity and creativity .
Last year , for a number of reasons , I found myself listening to many details of the American Public Radio program .
And so I listened and listened and at some point , I started to feel like all stories are about accidental findings .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I have no screw .
I became the crazy error lady .
I just imagined it everywhere . &quot; &quot; What really happened .
But a few months later , I was invited to interview Aira Glass , the host of the program .
And I mentioned this in front of him , and he said , &quot; No , actually , that &apos;s the truth . &quot;
In fact , he says , &quot; &quot; As a team we make sure that every chapter of our program has the same hidden subject .
The unseen issue is : I thought this was what was going to happen and instead something else happened , and the point is , &quot; &quot; Aira Glass says , &quot; &quot; We need it .
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and error to make stories work . &quot; &quot; And for us , the friends in the audience , as listeners , as readers , we swallow this material .
We love things like complications in the delicious night and surprising contradictions .
When it comes to our stories , we like to make mistakes .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think one thing &apos;s going to happen instead is something else .
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a weapon of mass destruction , release the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened somewhere .
And Hosni Mubarak thought he would be a single ruler in Egypt for the rest of his life , until he turned too old or too sick and could transmit the ruler to his son .
And something else happened somewhere .
And you might have thought you &apos;d grow up and married your loved ones from high school and come back to your hometown and grow kids together .
And something else happened somewhere .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an unbelievably nerdy book about a topic that everybody hates for an audience that will never happen .
And something else happened somewhere .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
For better and worse , we make those stories that we will not believe about the world around us , and then the world rotates around and amazes us .
Without offering , this whole conference is an unbelievable memorial for our ability to make mistakes .
We just finished spending a week talking about innovation , developmental and improvements , but you know why we need all these developmental innovations and improvements ?
Because half of the world &apos;s most mindful and variable things — TED 1998 — ah .
( Laughter ) They didn &apos;t work right , right . ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my Chinese slogan Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So here we are again here .
And this is how it happens .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We &apos;re doing another conference .
The issue of this , as you &apos;ve heard friends seven million times , is rediscovering wonder .
And for me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you have to go out of the tiny , unified place of being right and look around each other and look at the immense size of complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On November 5 , 1990 , a man named El Sagle Newser walked into a hotel in Manhattan and murdered Herbie Mir as a president , the chief of the League of Jewish defense .
First , Newser is not guilty of murder , but as he talks about trafficking , he and other people started planning assaults on a dozen targets in New York City , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations .
Luckily , these programs were frustrated by the FBI informant .
Unfortunately , the explosion in 1993 of the World Trade Center did not eat .
Newser finally convicted in his engagement in a flow .
Al Sagier is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 , to the father , an Egyptian engineer , and if an American loves and a teacher in elementary school , who together tried as much as they could make me happy girls .
It wasn &apos;t until you were seven years old that my family dynamic started to change .
My father exposed me to the side of Islam that very few people , including most Muslims , go to see .
It was my experience that when people take time to communicate with each other , it doesn &apos;t take much time to realize that , most of us , we all want the same things in life .
However , in every religion , in every population , you will find a small percentage of the people who hold their faith so powerful that they feel that they have to use any possible way to make others live like them .
A few months before his arrested , he sat down and explained that for the last weekends , he and some friends went to the range of Long Island for a bullet training .
He told me I would walk with him the next morning .
We got to the Kaluverton range , unknownst of our group was under the FBI surveillance .
When my turn came , my father helped me hold the gun on my shoulder and explain to me how to target a target at about 30 meters away .
That day , the last ball that I served hit a little orange light that sat on the target and surprised everyone , especially mine , the whole goal came up with flames .
My uncle turned to the other people , and he said in Arabic , &quot; &quot; Ivan Abu . &quot; &quot; The son like his father .
They were all very funny about this comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years ago that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
They thought they saw me the same destruction that my father was capable of .
These people ended up being convicted in bringing a van full of 500 kilograms of material exploded into the lower parking in the northern hemisphere of the World Trade Center , which caused the explosion that killed six people and injured 1,000 others .
These were the people I had to model .
These were the people I read his mother , which means encouragement .
By the time I turned 19 , I had been through apartments for 20 times in my life , and the instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really give me a chance to connect a lot .
Every time I would start to feel comfortable with someone , it was time for Arice and move to the next city .
To be the permanent new face in the classroom , I &apos;ve often been the target for the bullies .
I kept my identity at the secret of my classmates to avoid becoming a target , but it turns out , being the quiet , fat and new child in the classroom was more than a mosquito producer .
So most of the time , I spent at home reading books and watching television or playing video games .
For those reasons , my social skills are missing , to be gentle , and to be at home not tolerant to others , I was not ready for the real world .
I was raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like the race or religion of a person .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential election .
Through the college preparation group , I could be part of the National Houth Conference in Philadelphia .
My particular group focused on youth violence , and as a victim for most of my life , it was a subject that I had a strong passion for .
Our friends in our group came from all walks of life .
One day near the end of the conference , I found that one of the children I connected with was Jewish .
Now , it took a few days for this movie to be exposed , and I realized there was no natural hostility between us .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and I actually had a sense of pride in being able to get through the barrier that most of my life made me believe that I was unpredictable .
Another major turning point comes when I found summer work in Bush Gardens , an amusement park .
There , I was exposed to people from all beliefs and cultures , and this experience has proved to be meaningful to the development of my character .
Most of my life , I &apos;ve been taught that homosexuality has been a sin , and through that , all the gay people have had a negative impact .
In case , I had the opportunity to work with some proud performers on the show there , and I soon found that many of them were the nicest people , and the least judgments I &apos;ve ever met .
To experience interviews as a child , I had a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others , and it came to me very unnatural to relate to nice people in a different way than the way I would like them to join me .
Because of that feeling , I was able to resist stereotypes that taught me as a child with experience and interactions of real life .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I know very well the sense of being judged by something beyond your control .
So it came the &quot; &quot; Dilly Shoo . &quot; &quot; On a daily basis , John Stewart forced me to be an intellectual danger with myself about my racism and helped me understand that the race of a human , religion or sexual tendency wasn &apos;t about the character of the human .
He was in many ways a father figure for me when I was desperate to one .
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian has made more impact on my positive worldview than my extreme father has not moved without attention .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview started to change and she told me something that I would hold close to my heart as long as I live .
She looked at me in the eyes of someone who had experienced enough examples of a whole life , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hate people . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside you .
Zack Ibrahim is not the real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end my father and start a new life .
So why would I reveal myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m doing it in the hope that maybe someone one day feels like having to use violence might sound my story and realize that there &apos;s a better way , that although I was given to this violent ideology and this impatience , I didn &apos;t become a feminist .
Instead , I chose to use my attempt to heat terror , to heat impatience .
I do this for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the horrible pain and loss that terrorism imposed their lives .
For the terrorist attacks , I &apos;m going to talk to these unreasonable acts and defend my father &apos;s actions .
And with this simple fact , I &apos;m standing here as evidence that violence is not rooted or somebody &apos;s race , and that the son doesn &apos;t have to go on his father &apos;s knees .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , all of you . ( Applause ) Thank you everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m glad to be here .
And I &apos;m honored . Thank you .
I &apos;d love to talk about the things that punish me , but unfortunately I feel that what interests me is not going to be interested in many others .
First , my brand claims I &apos;m an astronomer .
I &apos;d love to talk about my astronomy , but I &apos;m afraid that the number of people who are interested in a radiation transition in non-metaphorical atmospheres and the manipulation of light in the upper atmosphere of Yufier is similar to a number of people who can go inside a bus stop .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about this .
( Laughter ) It would be just as fun to talk about all the things that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when hackers hacked our systems at Lawrence Berkeley Lab .
And when I caught them , it turned out they were working for what was then the Soviet C.D. , and they were stealing information and selling it .
So I would love to talk about it , and it would be fun , but , after 20 years ...
I find computer security , actually , quite boring .
It &apos;s crazy .
I — the first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
The third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . After doing something , I do something else .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that either .
And it &apos;s not about what I think are the most obvious statements from the first book to the Silicon oil , or the second book , and I &apos;m not going to talk about why I think schools don &apos;t have to be computers .
I feel that there &apos;s a huge bizarre idea that goes around that we need to put more computers into schools .
My idea is : No ! No !
Take them out of schools , and leave them away from schools .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who has walked around in a classroom room so you don &apos;t have to talk about it much even though I guess I might be very wrong about it , and all the other things I &apos;ve said .
So don &apos;t come back and read my thesis .
There &apos;s probably all kinds of lies there as well .
So after I said this , I built my talk principle about five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) If you look at it here , the main thing I wrote about my toes is the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , right ?
Ah , right . My feeling is that I &apos;m asked to talk about the future is weird , because I have a sit hair , so it &apos;s a little silly that I &apos;m going to talk about the future .
In fact , I think if you really want to know what &apos;s going to be in the future , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask technology , scientist or physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask someone who writes code .
No , if you want to know what the company will look like in 20 years , ask a garden .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t just ask a gardener , that &apos;s an experience gardener .
They &apos;re the ones who know what society will look like in another generation .
I — no . And no , I &apos;m afraid , many other people who talk about what the future will be .
Of course , we can all imagine the cool new things that are going to be here .
But for me , things are not the future .
When I ask myself , what would the company look like , when the kids today are incredibly good at sending text messages and spending a lot of time in front of a screen , but they never went to Beliing together .
Changing happens , and the change that happens is not software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , and it was fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing today . What am I doing today ?
Oh , the second thing I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right here . Right here .
Can you see ? I want to talk about single-sided things .
What I &apos;d really like to talk about is things that have one side .
Because I love Mobius loops , not only do I love Mobius loops , I &apos;m also one of the few people , if not the only person in the world , who produces a bottle of Clay .
Right now , I hope that all of you are going to be tickled .
This is a bottle of California .
Those of you in the audience who know this , you roll your eyes and say , yes , I know everything about it .
It only has one side . It &apos;s a bottle whose face is also his arrow .
It has a zero volume , and it &apos;s not directable .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two Mubius loops and sew their common tip together , you get one of those . I make them glass .
And I &apos;d like to talk to you about this , just that I don &apos;t have too much — what to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Announcer : I &apos;ve been filming ) Anyway , the letter D in TED is a design presentation , of course . Design .
Just two weeks ago , I made — you know , I made small , mediocre , big bottles for the conference .
But what I just had fun — and I &apos;m happy to show you , for the first time in public .
This is a bottle of coin that &apos;s also a bottle of wine , which , although in four dimensions , is not supposed to be able to contain fluids at all , is certainly able to do that because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
And because our universe only has three spatial dimensions , it can contain fluids .
And so , that &apos;s the cool thing .
It was a month of my life .
But even though I &apos;d like to talk to you about topology , I &apos;m not going to do that .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mother , who died last summer .
She collected pictures of me , as mothers do .
Can anybody project this guy ?
And I looked at her album and she kept a picture of me standing there , more correctly sitting before a pile of dials .
And I looked at this and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; Alaim , this was taken when I worked in the electronic music studio !
As a technician , you maintain and repair the electronic music studio at the University of New York in Buffalo . Wow !
The &quot; &quot; time machine &quot; &quot; — and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah !
And that sent me back ...
Soon after that , I found another picture of me that she was preserving .
This guy is me , of course .
And this man is Robert Mugg , the sponsor of a brand synthesizer , who died last August .
Robert Mugg was a great , generous , well-known man and engineer .
A musician who spent time in his life teaching me , a first year student at the University of New York in Buffalo .
He would come from Toronto to teach me not just about the synthesizer of a brand , but we would sit there — I studied physics at the same time . 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We learn physics , I learn physics , and then he says , &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t stuck in electronic music if you learn physics . &quot; &quot; He used to educate me . He would come and spend hours with me .
He wrote a letter to me to get a follow-up curriculum .
In the background , my bike .
Now I realize that this picture was taken in a friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Mugg came and put a whole bunch of equipment in order to show a patent and I had all kinds of things about it .
We sat down and talked about productive taxes , basket functions , tunnel functions , things like that .
Bob Hsummer &apos;s paperwork was a love for all of us .
Anyone who is a musician is deeply influenced by Robert Mug .
( Applause ) Just saying what I &apos;m going to do . What I &apos;m going to do — I hope you &apos;ve recognized that there &apos;s a dead sine wave , an almost triangered wave in this HP oscope .
Cool . I can get to this place here , right ?
Children . Children are what I want to talk about — is that okay ?
It says children here , that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
I decided , at least for me , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
So I think local and local .
I feel the best way to help something is to help locally , very local .
So a Ph.D. here , and a degree there , Vida de Yad .
I talked about these clouds with some teachers about a year ago .
And one of them , actually some of them came to me and said , &quot; How is it that you don &apos;t teach ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; I went to graduate school — I went to graduate school . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , if you &apos;re so loving kids and all these things , how is it that you &apos;re not there on the front ?
Your actions will fit your talk . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s true . Right . I teach science to class four days a week .
Not just appears here and there .
No , no , no . I show presence .
I come to mountaintop parks . ( Applause ) It &apos;s not , no , it &apos;s not a matter of applause .
I highly recommend each of you to do something like this .
Not just come to one classroom or another .
Teach , a whole week . Well , I &apos;m in three quarters of a job , but that &apos;s good enough .
One of the things I did with my science students is tell them , &quot; I &apos;m going to teach you physics at college level . &quot;
Without calculus , that &apos;s what I &apos;m cutting .
You don &apos;t need to know trigo .
But you have to know a fifth grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
Without all the Open to Four seven and solve all the problems of the E.U.
We &apos;re going to do real physics . And that &apos;s one of the things I thought we &apos;d do right now .
( Higher sound ) Ah , before I turn it on , one of the things we did three weeks ago in the classroom — that &apos;s through the lens , and one of the things that we used this lens is measure the speed of light .
My students at Al Saritto , I helped , of course , and with a very old , very old microscope , measured the speed of light .
We missed 20 percent . How many classmates do you know measured the speed of light ?
We also measured the speed of sound .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
I was ready to do that , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to challenge the power of power , and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m already organized to do that , organized to do that , but then it turns out that to organize here , you only have 10 minutes to prepare !
And there &apos;s not enough time to do that .
So next time , maybe , I &apos;ll isolate the speed of light !
But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
Well the obvious way of measuring the speed of sound is to restore the sound over something and test the echo .
But , probably — after my students , Eriel , said , &quot; Can you measure the speed of light using the wheel equation ? &quot;
You all know what the wheel equation is : double the length of each wave ...
It &apos;s constant . When the frequency goes up , the length of the wave goes down , as the length of the wave goes up , the frequency goes down . So if we have a wave here , here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — when the peak is higher , the things are closer , when the peak is lower , everything is stretched .
Right ? It &apos;s simple physics .
You all know this from sixth grade , remember ?
What you weren &apos;t told in physics classes , in the physics of the eighth grade , but they needed , and the wish they were doing that , is that if you double the frequency of the sound or the light , you get a constant .
And that constant will be the speed of sound .
So to measure the speed of sound , all I have to do is know the frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
I have a frequency dimension here .
We &apos;ll apply it to A more or less .
Now , so I know the frequency .
That &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure the length of the wave .
All I have to do is turn on another fund , the bottom one is I &apos;m talking , right ?
So every time I &apos;m talking , you &apos;ll see it on the screen .
I &apos;ll put it here , and when I move it from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
The movements like Salinky . We go through different nodes of the wave , come out of here .
I hear the physicists among you who roll their eyes , but let me wait a minute . ( Laughter ) To measure the length of the wave , all I have to do is measure the distance from here , a full wave , to here .
From here to here , this is the length of the sound .
So we put a scale here and here , and then we move back here .
I moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters away , back here 20 centimeters .
Okay , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Ello .
And let &apos;s say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 hertz .
The length of the wave is 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s think what comes out .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 meters is 352 meters per second .
And if you look at the books , it &apos;s actually 343 .
But here with rudimentary equipment , and a devastated drink , we were able to measure the exact speed of sound — not bad . Pretty good .
All of this joins what I wanted to say .
Go back to my picture about a million years ago .
This year is 1971 , the Vietnam War goes on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics — to the video , to Fashza Risenic and Juliet .
I go home for a semi-inch vacation , there are riots in campus .
There are eruptions ! Hey , done .
There are eruptions in campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
I go in campus , a police officer comes to me , looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Take a gun out . Boom !
And a gas station the size of a Pepsi can fly around my head . Whoosh !
I breathe some hydrogen gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
The officer is chasing me with a gun .
He wants to hit me in my head !
I say , &quot; &quot; I have to fly away ! &quot; &quot; I run and cross the campus as fast as I could . I &apos;m digging into the Highway Hall .
This is one of those guys with a bell tower .
And the officer is chasing me .
Running after the first floor , second floor , third .
Inside a room .
The entrance room for the column tower .
I &apos;m taking the door behind me , climbing up , I &apos;m going through the place where I see the pendulum wandering .
And I think , oh yeah , the fourth root of the length is proportionate for the fluctuation . ( Laughter ) I keep climbing , going back .
You go to a place where a move splits .
There &apos;s a Klock noise , Clock , Clock Clock .
Time comes back because I &apos;m in it .
I think of Einstein &apos;s intention and relativity .
I climb up , and then there &apos;s a place , right behind , where you can climb a tree ladder .
You pick up the laundry , and there &apos;s a dome .
One of these dome is three meters old .
I look out and I see the cops blocking students &apos; heads , shooting gas from sunlight , and students throw white .
And I ask myself , what am I doing here ? Why am I here ? And then I remembered something my high school teacher said .
That when you make bells , you release some writing on them .
So I wipe out the six pigeons over one of the beads , and I look at it .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , now the time I &apos;m going to tell you what was a root there on the bell in the bell tower on the napkin &apos; name . &quot; &quot; All truths are one .
In this light , if science and religion will rise here on the steady development of humanity , darkened with light , external Egypt across horizons , prejudice science to tolerance .
For the voice of life , call us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
Well , I had a lot of time to think in those eight hours without sleep .
It sounds healthy sense , and that &apos;s exactly what it is , but it &apos;s ridiculous in a lot of science , based on how our spatial memory works .
The lower one is the number you need to treat .
But actually , medicine doesn &apos;t work that way .
Good morning !
Are you cities ?
They took the tag out of me , but I wanted to ask you , did any of you write his name on the Arabic switch ?
Anybody ? No one ? Well , there &apos;s no problem .
Not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with a friend and I wanted to invite .
I turned to the waiter and said , &quot; Is there a menu ? &quot;
He looked at me in wonder , as if he didn &apos;t sound good .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re the menu , please . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know what you call it ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; Is French expression accurate ?
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of it ! &quot; &quot; The waiter said .
He was running around talking to me , like he said to himself , &quot; Even if it was the last girl in the world , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
What does that mean to say &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Two words made a young white man judge a girl as if she was old and bee .
How could she talk like this ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It freaked me crazy .
It must hurt !
Have I been privileged to speak in my own language in my country ?
Where else is this happening ?
How did we get there ?
As we are here , there are many like me who will get to the stage of their lives , where they will leave that they don &apos;t want to do anything that happened to them in their own world , just so that they can say they &apos;re modern and decorated .
Should I forget my whole culture , my thoughts , wisdom and all my memories ?
The childhood stories might be the most beautiful memories of war !
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to stand up with the consent ?
To be one of them ?
Where is the logic in all of this ?
However , I tried to understand .
I didn &apos;t want to judge him in the same hardware that he judge me .
Arabic language is not enough for me today .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language that &apos;s used to at universities , a language that &apos;s used in the workplace , a language that &apos;s trusted when you do advanced research , and certainly not a language that &apos;s used in airports .
If we were to do that , we would pull us out of our own hands .
Where can I use it ? We can all ask this question !
You want us to use Arabic . Where can we do so ?
This is one reality .
But there &apos;s another reality , more important that we have to think about .
Arabic is the native language .
Researchers say that controlling other languages requires control of the native language .
Mother language control is an early condition for creative expression in other languages .
How come ?
Jabran Khalil Jabran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , his imaginations and his philosophy were inspired by the little boy in the village where he grew up , smuggling a certain smell , hearing a certain voice , and thinking about certain thoughts .
So when he started writing in English , he had enough payload .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his letters in English , you smell the same smell , you feel the same feeling .
You can feel that this is indeed the person who writes in English , the same child who comes from the mountains , a village on Hero-Lebanon .
This is an example that you can &apos;t argue about .
Usually they say that if you want to eliminate a nation , the only way to save is by eliminating abundance .
It &apos;s a reality that the developed companies are aware of .
The Germans , the French , the Japanese and the Chinese , are all aware of this .
So they &apos;re laws to keep their lips .
They make it sacred .
So they use it in creativity , they spend a lot of money to solve .
Are we smarter than them ?
Well , we don &apos;t belong to the developed world , the developed things still didn &apos;t come to us , and we &apos;d like to close the gap from the advanced world .
Countries that used to be like us , but decided to strive towards development , do research , and close the gap with developed countries , like Turkey , Malaysia and so on , they carried their lips while they climbed up the ladder , kept it as if there was diamond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you see any product from Turkey or somewhere else and it &apos;s not written in Turkish , then it &apos;s not local product .
They will not believe it &apos;s a local product .
They will come back to be just consumers , consumers who have no idea , as we are most of the time .
So , so they could invent and make , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; what does that tell you ?
It &apos;s not a familiar shadow , right ?
No matter who , how and why .
Language is not just for talking , it &apos;s not just words coming out of the mouth .
Language represents steps that are defined in our lives , and comfort associated with our emotions .
So when I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , Independence , &quot; &quot; each of you draws a particular image in your mind , some emotions form on a particular day in a certain historical period .
Language is not just one , two or three words connected to each other .
It &apos;s the idea within , about how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our intellect ?
When do we know that one person understood or not ?
If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; or if your son comes and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived in a period of freedom passwords ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem here , I &apos;d better stop talking to the equation and leave .
The thing is that these phrases remind us of certain things .
I have a French speaker who is married to a French man .
I used to ask her what she was interested in .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all right , but one time I tried to translate to him for a whole night the word &apos; tobacco orbni . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The danger , took over by tobacco orbni , and then spent a whole night trying to explain to him .
He wondered how could someone be so caring ?
Would you want to lose ?
&apos;Tell me ? &apos; This is one of the examples .
It made us feel that she couldn &apos;t say that word to her husband , because he wouldn &apos;t understand , and Jupiter wouldn &apos;t understand ; the shape of his thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listened to me to Paris , and one night , I tried to translate to him so that he could feel what I feel when I listen to the Paris . &quot; &quot; The danger was trying to translate it to him : &quot; I pulled my hands and stole you from them — ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the punchline : &quot; And because you belong to them , I left my hand backwards and I gave you away . &quot; ( Laughter )
Tell me that .
( Applause ) So what did we do to keep the Arab language ?
We made it into the interest of civil society and we launched a campaign to preserve Arabic language .
Even though people told me , &quot; &quot; What are you for ?
Give the headache and enjoy life . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic Conservation campaign created a password that says , &quot; I will talk to you from the East , but you will answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say we didn &apos;t want to get that thing or another . We didn &apos;t adopt that kind of style because then we didn &apos;t understand us .
And when someone talks to me like this , I hate Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be safe in the way that reflects our dreams , our aspirations and our ordinary lives .
Sure how we dress up and think .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you from the East , but you answer the West , &quot; &quot; Listen to the cause .
Something very simple , but creative and convincing .
Then we launched another campaign with mirrors of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example of this outside , a mirror of a letter surrounded by a black-yellow movie with the letter &quot; Don &apos;t eradicate your language ! &quot;
Now seriously , why not eliminate your language ?
We do not have to eradicate our lips .
If we were to eliminate language , we would have to look for identity .
We had to look for existence .
We had to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s beyond just cutting our opportunity to be modern and motivated .
Then we published images of men and women wearing the Arab characters .
Pictures of cool men and women .
We &apos;re very cool !
And for those who might say , &quot; &quot; Here , you used the word English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &quot; &quot; cool . &quot; &quot; Give them happy as much as they want , but show me a word that is more beautiful and more appropriate for reality .
I &apos;ll keep saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; and I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going into a global hub network . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t work ! We don &apos;t have to complete ourselves .
But to get to this point , we all have to be convinced that we can &apos;t afford anyone who is stronger or who thinks that has some supreme about language , control us or make us think and feel what they want .
The idea is creativity .
If we can &apos;t get to space or build a spacecraft and so on , we can be creative .
Right now , every one of you is a creative project .
Creativity , in your mother &apos;s language , is the way .
Let &apos;s start from that moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or make a short movie .
One novel can make us global again .
It can restore Arabic language to be number one .
So it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we need to know it and be convinced that the solution is there , and that benefits us the duty to be part of the same solution .
Finally , what can we do today ?
Twitter , who &apos;s tweeting now ?
Please , I &apos;m a beginner , even though my time is over , no matter whether it &apos;s Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t listen to Arabic in the audacious letters involved with literature !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a big trouble ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back from a place like this and rise .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re here today not to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to pay attention to preserving language .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
A baby first identifies his father through language .
When my daughter was born , I will tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , I will visit . &quot; &quot; I will not say to her , &quot; &quot; This is your damad , I will deliver . &quot; &quot; And on Supermarket , I promise that Conor , if she tells me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , Merci , Maerman , Major , &quot; &quot; nobody heard it .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get out of this cultural revelation . ( Applause )
Sustainability represents the &apos; what , &apos; where &apos; and &apos; how &apos; what we &apos;re going to talk about .
And the &quot; &quot; who &quot; &quot; and why &quot; &quot; are the important ones for me .
I want to know the people behind my food choices .
I want to know how I affect them .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they &apos;re fish .
I want to know how they rely on the abundance in water for their livelihood .
The understanding of all of these allows us to change our concept of the seafood from a commodity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows us to respect the seafood that &apos;s better than us to eat .
So how should we call it ?
I think we &apos;ll risk them from seafood .
If sustainability is the ability to negotiate , rehabilitation is the ability to innovate full and advance .
Seawater pollutants allow us to have an evolving and dynamic system and recognize our relationship with the sea as a resource , where the idea is that we get involved in ocean news and encouraging resilience .
It has much more hope , much more human and much more useful , as a way to understand our environment .
A pocket guide — a lot of producers in the marine conservation world — they &apos;re very useful , they &apos;re a great tool .
Green lists , yellow and red lists of all kinds of seafood .
It &apos;s easy to do the link : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about all yellow .
But I think it &apos;s certainly not enough to just eat from the green list .
We can &apos;t achieve sustainability without measuring our success to make real change in the fate of the yellow and red species .
But what if we eat just from the green list ?
Here &apos;s a yellowfin tuna that &apos;s in the dark — comes from sustainable challenges .
Dig in the dark — there &apos;s no side god .
It &apos;s good for fishermen . A lot of money , support for local economies .
But it &apos;s an aquatic lion . It &apos;s a superpredator .
What is the context of that meal ?
Do I sit in a steak to eat half a kilo of that ?
Do I do it three times a week ?
Maybe I &apos;m still on the green list , but I &apos;m not very good at myself , or you , or with the sea .
The point is that we have to have a connection , a measure of our actions in all of this .
An example : I heard a great red wine for my health — antioxidant and minerals — healthy for heart .
Great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;ll drink a lot of it . I &apos;ll be so healthy .
So a few bottles will tell me that I have a problem ?
folks , we have a protein problem .
We lost that diagnosis capacity in all of our food , and we pay for that price .
The problem is that we hide the price below the waves .
We hide the price behind social agreement to confront the line .
And we hide the price behind a paralyzed profits .
And so the first thing about the idea of seafood is to really consider our needs .
The best representation of seafood eaters is not in &quot; &quot; Jaws &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Flapper &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; The Guardian Gordon , &quot; &quot; but in &quot; &quot; The Incredible Incredible Hulk &quot; &quot; products .
vegetables : They may save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
So in honor I want to say that the green of the broccoli might be the new blue .
We have to keep eating the best of the seafood , if anything .
But we also need to eat with tons of vegetables .
But the best part of drinking seafood is that they come on a shelf with a bottle of Tasco and lemon salt .
Or as a 150-gram toothfish developer coated in the default of Dajon and fierce of clothing bread alongside a pile of Flapper Pac-Kinoa and open broccoli and so soft , sweet , smiling and smoking outside with a cockroach in Chile .
Hooo !
It will go fast .
And the best part is that all of these components are available to every family in the neighborhood supermarket .
Jamie Oliver runs a propaganda to saving America from our feeding practices .
Sylvia is running propaganda to saving the oceans from our feeding practices .
There &apos;s a pattern here .
Leave the nuclear Holocaust ; the fork is that we have to worry about .
We wasted the world and used food that we produced to lay itself in some ways .
For me , the eating thing is wrong with us .
So I think it &apos;s time for us to change our expectations from our food .
Sustainability is a complex subject , but meal is a reality that we can all understand very well .
So let &apos;s start with that .
There &apos;s been a lot of movements recently for transition to green food systems .
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are passionately leading the Green Food Revolution .
But green foods often represent a way that allows us to ignore our sisters as food .
The fact that it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t allow us to throw in the food in the dish .
We have an environmentally friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have the technology .
But we will never have an eco-friendly shrimp buffer in your efficacy .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
A healthy meal for the heart is an important component in the hot seafood .
As we deal with the minimum sea population , the media recommend to consume more seafood .
According to studies , tens of thousands of grandmothers , grandparents , American mothers and fathers will get to celebrate another birthday if we eat more seafood .
That prize I &apos;m not willing to give up .
But it &apos;s not just about seafood .
This is how we see our success .
As a chef , I know the easiest thing for me is to minimize the credibility that I clicked .
And then a few things will happen .
I &apos;ll earn more .
People will start to invite suicide and salad , because they will realize that they can &apos;t be filled with only the main tune .
The people will spend a lot more time dealing with the meal , in personal media during the meal .
In short , the people will get more than they came to get , even though they got less proteins .
They got more calories during a diverse meal .
They got healthier . I earned more .
That &apos;s great .
The environmental consideration was encountered in every dish , but it was encountered in time as a huge pile of consideration in the human interest .
One of the other things that we did was we started diverting the species that we serve — usually we served silver fish , analytics , refrigerators and little crabs .
Cars , tribes , oysters , shells , shells , geeks , Chear — these were the normal species .
We directed the sense of flavor towards the more resilient and healthier possibilities .
Those we need to prefer .
This is what &apos;s written on the green list .
But so we can also start to restore our environment .
And what about all those big predators , those fashion species , the same tuna from the green list I mentioned earlier ?
So if you have to , I have a recipe for you .
It will fit any big fish in the ocean , and there it is .
Start with half a pound of a big fish .
Take a knife and cut it into four art .
Put them on four humidity .
Add those four successes , vegetables and then developed your best Borgendi bottle , turn on the candles and start celebrating .
To celebrate the opportunity that will let you eat it .
You invited your friends and neighbors and repeat it every year , maybe .
I have a lot of happy expectations .
I expect health and happiness and family and community .
I expect to make ingredients , preparing the gifts and eating the meals all be part of the cooperation of human interests .
I was lucky , and my father was a great kitchen .
And he had taught me at the beginning about the privilege of eating .
I &apos;m very reminded of my childhood dinner .
They were plausible doses of protein that were acquired with vegetable abundance and small amounts of starch , usually in the form of rice .
That &apos;s mostly how I still eat today .
I get a steak battery .
I &apos;m kidnapping a meat feed sweat .
It &apos;s like a protein overlap .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But of all the bad news that you &apos;ll hear and hear about our ocean situation , some of the grim role to tell you the worst news of all , which is that all of your mothers were right .
You eat the vegetables .
Very simple .
So what are we looking for for at lunch ?
For health , I look for full components that are good for my body .
In terms of joy , I look for butter and salt and sexy things so that tastes are less satisfied .
In terms of family , I look for recipes that will respect my own history .
But in community terms , we start from the beginning .
There is no escape from the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
Try if you can learn as best you can what that effect is and then take the first step to minimize it .
We saw a picture of our blue planet , our global bank .
But it &apos;s more than the reservoir of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the sharing ceremony that we call a meal .
So if we take all of us just as much as our needs , because then we can start to divide in the rest , we can start celebrating , we can start restoring .
We have to tag on the vegetable taste .
We need to tag on small doses of seafood .
And we need to start asking our meals .
Thank you .

Hello , I &apos;m an architect .
I &apos;m the only architect in the world that makes cardboard paper structures like this and this is the first exhibition I built with paper cylinders .
In 1986 , long before people started talking about ecological and environmental issues , I started looking at paper waves as a building material .
The process of testing the material was very complicated , but it turned out to me that it was a more powerful material than I thought it was very easy to resist the water and yes , because of being an industrial material , there was a possibility to become a fire .
In 1990 , I built this temporary structure of this material .
That was the first building of its kind made of paper .
It &apos;s made up of 330 cylinders in a 55 centimeters diameter , there are only 12 cylinders in diameter of 120 centimeters or a four-footprint exchange .
As you can see in this picture , this is the bathroom .
If you don &apos;t have the toilet paper , you can always shoot a piece of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a very useful thing .
In 2000 , there was supposed to be a big conference in Germany .
And I was asked to design the building where it would exist because it was a conference that was about environmental issues .
I had to build a paper towel house , when it was recycled paper .
My design goal is not just to make a specific structure .
It &apos;s about changing what happens when the baby is destroyed eventually . That &apos;s because every country produces a lot of whales and after half a year they destroy and creates a huge amount of industrial waste , but my building can be recycled or used differently .
When the conference ended , my building was reconstructed .
That was my design goal .
Next , I was lucky to win the competition to build the second Puppo Center in France in a handful .
Because I was poor , I wanted to hire a office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris and together , we built our own office on the roof of the Fominido Center in Paris .
So we brought paper cylinders and tree members required to pay the office that was going on for 35 meters .
We &apos;ve been working there for six years without paying rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I faced a big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , if a friend wanted to visit me , he needed to buy a ticket to see me .
That was the problem .
Or then , it was completed in the building of the Puppo Center in March .
This is a very popular museum now , which is a very , very popular way of doing it for government .
Or then I felt disappointed to my professional as an architect , because we didn &apos;t help or work for society , but for only privileged people , rich , government officials , entrepreneurs .
People with trust and survival .
These are invisible things .
So they hire our services to illustrate their power and their death by creating a monumental architecture .
This is our profession , this is the situation in historic vision and now we do the same thing .
So I was very disappointed that we &apos;re not working for society , although there are so many people who have lost their homes for natural disasters .
If I have to say that these are not really natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes don &apos;t kill people , buildings that kill people .
Here comes the responsibility of architects .
That &apos;s where people need temporary structures , but there &apos;s no available architects for this kind of work because we &apos;re too busy working for privileged people .
So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in reinventing temporary homes .
We can make a living .
That &apos;s why I started working in disaster areas .
In 1994 there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people have become refugees .
You don &apos;t know how surprised I was when I saw the refugee camp established by the U.N.
Here are these poor people , freezing them covered in blankets during the rainforest , in shelves built by the U.N. , which were actually assembled by a simple plastic sheet , in a combination of tree races that were wiped out the refugees , as you can see here .
Over two million people hijacked trees .
Which led to a large deforestation and a big environmental problem .
So the U.N. provided them aluminum tubes and aluminum structures .
That was worth a lot of money , so the refugees sold them and started to cut trees again .
So I proposed to use my method to improve the state of using recycled paper cylinders because it &apos;s cheap and strong material , when my budget is 50 dollars a unit .
We built 50 units in an experiment for testing material resistance , moisture flu , termites and so on .
And then , a year later , in 1995 in the city of Cuba , Japan , a big earthquake happened .
Almost 7,000 people were killed , and parts of the city like a quarter of Nagata , in a picture , large parts of the city were burned in a fire that broke after the earthquake .
I found that many Vietnamese refugees gathered in Catholic church to escape the horror even though the building was completely destroyed .
So I went there and proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church from paper cylinders ? &quot;
And the priest said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , did you touch ?
Is that what you &apos;re proposing after the fire that &apos;s broken here ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not sure in me but I haven &apos;t given up .
I started to improvise the city of Cuba , and I knew the local Vietnamese community .
They rated in these bad structures covered in plastic sheets in the park .
So I proposed to their daughters . I recruited money , did a thermal event .
I made paper cylinders for them and to make it easier for my students to build them and also to simplify the furniture process , I built the foundations from beer grains .
So I turned to the manufacturer of the Kirin please to organize , because at that time the manufacturer of the capital of Esari used red paint gases , which didn &apos;t match the color of the paper cream .
The color match is very important .
I still remember we all expected the beer grains to come full of beer bottles , but they came empty . ( Laughter ) That was a big disappointment .
So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 of these thoughts .
I finally made the priest to trust me with the Church jump .
He said , &quot; &quot; The more you raise the money yourself and get your students to do the construction pool , the more I give you . &quot; &quot; So for five weeks we rebuilt the church .
She was supposed to stand on a pathway for three years , but she actually stood there for 10 years because people were so excited about it .
A while later there was a big earthquake in Taiwan and proposed to donate this church to survivors there , so we piled it into pieces and sent them there to be re-assembled by volunteers .
The church stayed there as a permanent structure and is there today .
So this building became a permanent structure .
So I asked myself , what is a permanent structure and what is a temporary structure ?
Paper paper building can be a permanent structure as long as it loves people &apos;s eyes .
And concrete structure can also be temporary if it &apos;s built to make money .
In 1999 , a big earthquake happened in Turkey , I went there and used local materials to build shelters .
In 2001 , in West India , I also built shelters .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the earthquake in Sumatra and the tsunami , I rebuilt the Muslim fisheries villages .
In 2008 in the city of Chengdu , in Sachan County in China , close to 70,000 people were killed , and many schools collapsed and rejected because of corruption among authorities and the contractors .
I was asked to rebuild the right church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with Chinese students .
In one month , we completed the building of nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
And they &apos;re still used , even after the last earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in the city of Chile , Italy , there was also a major earthquake .
And here &apos;s a very interesting picture : former prime minister in Barceloni and former former former former former prime minister Aasso — because , you know , we trade the prime minister once a year .
And they kind of funded my idea .
I proposed a broadband , a temporary performance theater , because the city of Elecla is known for its connection to music and all its performance tools were destroyed , so the musicians began to leave .
So I told the mayor I &apos;d like to build a temporary auditorium .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you are the one who recruits the money , you are invited to do it . &quot; &quot; I was very lucky .
The Prime Minister Breeloscopi brought the G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us raise the money and got half a million Euros from the Japanese government to build the temporary auditorium .
In 2010 there was a major earthquake in Haiti , but you couldn &apos;t go there so I flew to Santu Domingos , a neighboring country , and from that I traveled for six hours to Haiti and local students from Santu Domingos , built 50 local paper cylinders .
Here &apos;s what happened in Japan two years ago , in Northern Japan .
After the earthquake and the tsunami , we had to turn people into a big space like the gym hall .
But notice , there &apos;s no privacy .
People were suffering as a result of that , mentally and physically .
So I went there with my students to build papercutting , which combined with curtains created a simple , efficient shelter .
However , some of the local executive people didn &apos;t want us to do it because they were throwing it on the control of being done in place .
But there was a real need to do that .
There were not enough maintaining areas required to build the landmarks that the government sent as you see here .
Notice , even the authorities did a pretty bad job building the temporary housing , a dense , messy building , no storage bands , water spills , so I thought we had to build a multiverse structure because there &apos;s not enough area and that would be a more comfortable solution .
So I proposed this to the mayor while building the stresses .
Eventually , I met a very nice mayor in a UNava village in Mugi .
He asked me to build three-dimensional structures on basketball courses .
I used containers and students helped create all the necessary furniture to create comfortable residential structures and all that within the government budget , the area of housing units was the same , but they were much more comfortable than the government .
A lot of people wanted to stay in them forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Today I work in a city of Curiosity , New Zealand .
About 20 days before the earthquake in Japan , they were also experiencing an earthquake and a lot of Japanese students were killed , the most important cathedral in the city of Crystal Church , was breeding even .
I was asked to come and build the right church .
Now the structure is in the early core .
And I &apos;d like to continue to create structures that people love and appreciate .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What &apos;s going on in this baby &apos;s brain ?
If we asked this question 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would say that this baby is irrational , irrational , aggregarian — that it cannot take into account another person &apos;s perspective or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely transformed this picture .
So in some ways , we think this baby &apos;s mindset is similar to the way the most brilliant scientists think .
Let me give you an example of this .
One of the things that this baby can think of is the thing that can employ his brain , is trying to understand what &apos;s going on in the other baby &apos;s brain .
After all , one of the hardest things for all of us is to understand what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the hardest thing is understanding that what other people feel and think doesn &apos;t match what we feel and think .
Anyone who tracks politics can indicate how hard it can be for certain people .
We wanted to know , could little babies and little children understand this fundamental thing about other people .
Now the question is : How can we ask them ?
Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if we ask a three-year-old boy about what he thinks , what we &apos;re going to get is a beautiful stream of monologue straight from the consciousness on birthday horses and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well , it turns out the secret was broccoli .
What we did , Betty Rackee , who was a student of mine , and I , was actually giving babies two hairs with food : one bowl of uncooked broccoli and another bowl with delicious glaciers in the form of gold .
All babies , even in Berkeley , love the liars and not the broccoli .
( Laughter ) But what Bati did was taste a little bit of any of the forests .
And then she behaved as if she loved what she took , or not .
Half the time she behaved as if she loves the liars and not the broccoli — like a baby and any other healing person .
But in the other half of the cases , she took a little piece of Brooklyi and said , &quot; &quot; Mmm , Broocoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the polls , and she would say , &quot; &quot; Ice , Yuck , cool !
I tasted the polls . Ice , Yuck , she behaved as if what she wanted was the opposite of what the baby wanted .
We did it with 15-month-old babies and 18 months .
So she would hang her hand and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What will the babies give her ? What they loved or what she loved ?
And the amazing thing was that 18 months old , who barely went and spoke , gave her the polls if she loved the polls , but gave her the broccoli if she loved the broccoli .
On the other hand , 15-month-old babies would just starve at her for a long time if she behaved like love the broccoli , as if they couldn &apos;t understand it .
But after they had been staring at her for a long time , they just gave her the polls , what they thought everybody loved .
So there are two amazing things about this .
The first is that these little babies , 18 months old , have already discovered this deep fact associated with human nature that we don &apos;t always want the same things .
Moreover , they felt they had to do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more worthy of that is the fact that since 15 months and 15-month-old people have not done so implicit that these 18 months have learned the profound and profound fact associated with human nature in the three months that have gone from being 15 months old .
That means that children know more and learn more than we would raise our minds .
And this is just one of many hundreds of studies from the last 20 years that really proves this .
The question you might ask is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
After all , if we look at babies , at first sight they look pretty useless .
In fact , in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to spend so much time and energy just to keep them alive .
But if we look at evolution to find an answer to the question of why we spend so much time dealing with worthless babies , it turns out there &apos;s actually a clear answer .
If we look at lots of species of animals , not just primates like us , but also other mammals , birds , even pockets like Vancouver , it turns out there &apos;s a relationship between the length of childhood and the size of the brain compared to the body and how smart and flexible the creatures are .
We selected as &quot; &quot; poster girls &quot; &quot; the two birds here .
On the one hand , the New Claudian pie .
The punishment and other gut , the thickness and so on are surprisingly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some ways .
And this is a bird on the cover of Science magazine who learned to use a tool to get food .
On the other side , we have our classmates .
Avae , ducks , chickens and Indian chickens are actually stupid as severe .
They &apos;re very good at studying nuclear , but they &apos;re not really good at anything else .
Well , so it turns out that the babies of the punishment , they &apos;re running out .
They rely on their mother that will put worms in their little slides into a two-year period , which is a very long time in bird &apos;s lifespan .
While the chickens actually mature within a few months .
So childhood is why the arteries arrive at the Science Magazine and the chickens end in soup .
There &apos;s something about this long childhood that seems to be about knowledge and learning .
So what kind of explanation do we have for this ?
Some animals , like the chicken look wonderfully adapted to do one very excellent task .
So they &apos;re really adapted to monitor the nuclei in a particular environment .
While other creatures , like the stones , are not very good at anything , but they &apos;re very good at learning the rules of different environments .
And of course , we &apos;re at the end of the spectrum like the stones .
We have larger brains relative to our bodies much more than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , more flexible , our learning capacity is bigger , we survive in different environments , we &apos;ve deployed to cover the world and even get to outer space .
And our children and babies depend on us much longer than any other species .
My son is 23 years old .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 years old , we &apos;re still throwing these worms into their little open mouth .
Okay , why do you see this correlation ?
Perhaps this strategy , this learning strategy , is a very good strategy to get in this world , but it has one big downside .
And that downside is that until you actually end learning everything , you &apos;re helpless .
So you wouldn &apos;t really want mammoth to chase you and ask yourself , &quot; Clara or maybe a nerd can fit . Who &apos;s better ? &quot;
You want to know all this before the deaths come .
And the way evolution seems to solve this problem is through a kind of role-play .
The idea is that we have the early period in which we are completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then , as adults , we can take all the same things that we &apos;ve learned as babies and children and use them to do tasks in the real world .
So one way to think about this is that little babies and little children are like the research and development department of the human species .
So they &apos;re these guys that all they have to do is go out and learn and come up with good ideas , and we will create and marketing .
We need to take all these ideas that we &apos;ve learned in being kids and really using them .
Another way to think about this is that instead of thinking about babies and children as scaffolding adults , we need to think of them as a different developmental phase of the same species — a little like larvae and butterflies — except that they &apos;re the great butterflies that go around and study their environment , and we &apos;re the larvae that crawl along the narrow , our adult .
If that &apos;s true , if babies are really designed to learn and this evolutionary story will tell us that children are destined to learn , that &apos;s why they are , we might expect that they &apos;re going to have a very strong learning mechanism .
Indeed , baby &apos;s brain is probably the most powerful learning computer in the world .
But real computers are getting better .
There was a revolution of just the way we understand machine learning recently .
It &apos;s all based on the ideas of this guy , the Thomist Bayes , who was a statistician and a mathematician in the 18th century .
Basically , what Bayes did was provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe the way scientists discover things about the world .
So how do scientists work ? They assume a hypothesis that they think is reasonable .
And then they go and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change the hypothesis .
And then they test the new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Bees showed was a mathematical way to do that .
And this mathematics underpins learning programs through the best machine we have today .
About 10 years ago , I proposed the idea that babies do the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on beyond these brown eyes , I think it looks something like this .
This is the Machine Bayes Company .
So I think these babies actually do complicated calculations with adaptive probability that they analyze to understand how the world works .
It could look like something too complicated to really prove .
Because after all , if you ask adults about statistics , they &apos;ll look very stupid .
So how could kids do statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we built called the Blickminet detector .
It &apos;s a box where a lightbulb is turned on and playing music when you put certain items on it , and with others , no .
And using this simple machine my lab and other labs have done dozens of studies that show how good the babies really are in studying the world .
Let me just show you one that we did with Thomas Kosener , my student .
If I showed you this detector , you &apos;d probably start to think that the way to run the detector would be to put a cube on the detector .
In reality , this detector works in a slightly strange way .
If we bend the cube over the detector , which would not have occurred in our mind , the detector would actually work twice out of three .
Whereas if you do the obvious thing from those , which is to put the cube on the detector , the detector will only operate twice out of six .
So the less likely assumption actually has stronger evidence .
It looks like the cube overlap is a better strategy than the other strategy .
So we did ; we gave the four-year-olds this pattern of evidence and we asked them to make it work .
And indeed , these kids used the pattern of evidence to bend the cube over the detector .
We found two really interesting things about this .
The first is — again , remember , this is four year-old children .
Only you learn to count .
But unconsciously they do pretty complicated calculations that give them a tool for measuring mass probability .
And the other interesting thing is that they use the evidence they &apos;ve got to get a sense , to get a premise about the world , which seems very unlikely in the first place .
In studies that we &apos;ve done in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve shown that four-year-olds are better at discovering unlikely assumptions than adults who give them the exact same task .
In these circumstances , children use statistics to learn about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see , do children do experiments as well .
When kids do experiments , we call it engaging with anything or , playing . There have been some interesting studies recently that showed that this game is actually a kind of experimental research .
Here &apos;s one of Crestine Legar &apos;s lab .
Cristine used the Blicket detector .
She showed the kids yellow dice made the detector act and red not , and then presented them with an outlier .
What you &apos;ll see here is that this little kid will move between five different assumptions in a two-minute period .
Boy : What about that ?
Same thing like the other side .
Alison Gobnik : OK , his first assumption failed .
( Laughter ) Child : It &apos;s on fire , and it &apos;s nothing .
AG : OK , he took his experiments out .
Boy : What makes it gasoline ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every researcher will recognize that despair view .
( Laughter ) Boy : Maybe because it should be like this , and it should be like this .
AG : OK , assume number two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh ...
( Laughter ) AG : Now moving to a new idea .
He told the researcher to do that , to try to put it on the other side .
Not working either .
Boy : Oh , because the light is just on here , not here .
Oh , at the bottom of this box there &apos;s electricity , and yet , there &apos;s no .
AG : OK , that &apos;s a fourth assumption .
Boy : It &apos;s on fire .
So when you &apos;re there four .
So that &apos;s what you have to put four in order for it to gasoline and two on it to make it gasoline .
AG : OK , here &apos;s his fifth assumption .
Now , this is a particularly cute and intelligent child , but what Cristine discovered is that actually it &apos;s not something extraordinary .
If you watch kids play , if you ask them to explain something to us , what they actually do is a series of experiments .
It &apos;s actually pretty common in four years old .
So , how is it going to be this kind of production ?
How is it to be one of these wonderful butterflies that can test five assumptions in two minutes ?
If we go back to all those psychologists and philosophers , many of them pointed out that babies and little children barely have awareness , if anything .
I think exactly the opposite is true .
I think babies and little children are more aware of what we are , adults .
That &apos;s what we know about how adults &apos; minds work .
The awareness and attention of adults look like a kind of light diamond .
What happens in adults is that we decide something that is relevant or important , so we should pay attention to it .
Our awareness of the same thing that we focus on turns out to be very bright and full of life , and everything else as if it goes into the dark .
We even know something about the way the brain does it .
What happens , when we &apos;re attached to something is that the prefrontal cortex , a management part of our brain , sends a signal that makes a small part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and closes the activity in all of our brain .
It causes a kind of very concentrated , objective attention .
If we look at babies and little children , we &apos;ll find something completely different .
I think babies and little children have a kind of a tenth of awareness than a dialogue of consciousness .
So babies and little kids are really not good at joining one particular thing .
But they &apos;re very good at pumping a lot of information from multiple sources at once .
And if we look at their brains , they seem to be surrounded by these neural transmitters that are great by learning and flexibility , and the parts that are nevertheless appear .
So when we say babies and little kids aren &apos;t successful at making attention , what we &apos;re actually saying is they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
They &apos;re bad at ignoring all the interesting things that they can learn something and looking only at what &apos;s really important .
It &apos;s a kind of attention , of consciousness , that we can expect from those butterflies designed to learn .
If we want to think about how to taste this kind of baby awareness , as adults , I think the best way is to think about all the cases where we &apos;ve been put in a situation where we &apos;ve never been before , when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a city for the first time .
What happens is not that our minds shrink , but it expands , so these three days in Paris look more filled with experiences and awareness than all the months of being a gay of the kind that goes , speaks and participates in academic meetings , there , at home .
And by the way , that beautiful coffee that you drink down , actually simulates the phenomenon of the baby transmitters .
So what is it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love with Paris , for the first time after retina three times espresso .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great way to exist , but it has a tendency to make you wake up in tears at 3 a.m. ( Laughter )
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be an adult .
We can do things like linking sledges or passing the road alone .
And it &apos;s pretty obvious that investors spend a lot of effort making babies think as adults think .
But if all we want is to be like those butterflies , to be able to learn , to keep an open head , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least in some of the time we need to get adults to start thinking more like children .

I &apos;m going to share with you a story about how I became an activist in the fight with HIV .
And this is the name of the activity , the journey of poetry .
In November of 2003 , I was invited to join the launch of Nelson Mandela Foundation of 4664 — this is his foundation for the fight in AIDS .
The 46664 number is Mandela &apos;s incarceration in a Ruban Island .
And this is me with Yoso Nader on stage , having a hell of fun .
The next day , all artists were invited to join a mandala on the island of most of them where he was going to do a press conference for journalists from all over the world , he was going to stand before the prison .
You can see the bars in the window there .
It was an exciting moment for all of us .
At that moment Mandela announced that the world &apos;s virtual Holocaust was happening in his country after the World War on Evergence of thousands die every day and the most important victims were women and children .
It really influenced me because I &apos;m a woman , and I &apos;m a mother and I didn &apos;t realize that HIV epidemic directly impacts women .
And so I feel committed — when I left South Africa when I left Cape Town , I said to myself , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s something I have to talk about .
I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And as a result , I participated in every 4664 fund event that I could get to , I did an interview press parties using my musical ability with my commitment to a mandate from an assessment to the tremendous and impossible work he did .
Everybody in the world respects Nelson Mandela , each one admires Nelson Mandela .
But do they know what &apos;s going on in southern Africa , the country with the highest number of infections of the virus ?
I think if I went out on the street now and I would tell people what was going on there they were overwhelmed .
I was very lucky , two years later when I met Zucky Ahmat of the journey to an amazing political activist activist action .
I met a 4664 event .
He wore a similar shirt to the shirt that I &apos;m wearing now .
This is a tool that tells you that I &apos;m in solidarity with people who have AIDS people who live with HIV .
In a way , because of the stigma , by wearing the shirt , I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
It should not be inside the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of a journey for politician action and I &apos;m very proud to be a company in this incredible organization .
It &apos;s a root journey with 80 percent women as members of them with positive HIV .
They work on the ground .
They have a huge impact on the people who live directly with the effects of the virus .
They have an educational plan .
They &apos;re looking at the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s extraordinary what they do .
And indeed , my song journey supported a journey for politician action in a way that I tried to raise awareness and also tried to raise money .
A lot of the contributions that I managed to recruit directly on a journey to political action and the amazing work they do and they continue to do in South Africa .
So this is my song journey .
The song journey is basically me and three or four great people helping me .
I &apos;ve traveled around the world for the last two and a half years , I &apos;ve been in about 12 different countries .
Here I am in Oslo , Norway getting a Sarah oil cast in Hong Kong , trying to convince people to raise money .
In Honsburg , I had the opportunity to play the audience , and in most of it , from the middle class in South Africa that ended up using films that really touched them , all the way that this terrible tragedy happens that people tend to ignore because they &apos;re tired and they don &apos;t really know what the solutions are .
Aaron Motswani , the current health minister was in this show and I had the opportunity to meet him and he gave me his full commitment to try and make a change that is really necessary .
This is the Scottish Parliament .
That &apos;s why I became a mission for Scotland and AIDS .
And I showed them my experience and tried , again , to inspire awareness .
And another time in Edinburgh with the African children &apos;s choir that I just admire .
And these kids , many of them are orphaned because their family was affected by HIV .
Here I &apos;m sitting in New York with Michelle Cidba is the director of New AIDS .
It &apos;s a great honor for me that Michelle invited me a few months ago to be the director of New AIDS .
And in this way I held my show and expanded my degree of influence .
The message that New AIDS is now sending to the world is that we want to see the virtual elimination of the infection from mother to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
This can happen .
And here I am with a pregnant woman who has positive HIV and we smile , both of us smiling , because we &apos;re very confident because we know that this young woman gets treated so that her life will take care of the baby she &apos;s going to have a child .
And her baby will get PMTCT that means that this baby can be born clean from the virus .
Now this is a prevention and right at the beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to begin to look at intervention in the HIV epidemic .
Now , I want to end by telling you a little story about a dive .
This is a dive she goes with me wherever I go .
I tell her story to everybody because she represents one of millions of AIDS orphans .
The mother of a nightmare had the HIV virus , she died of disease caused by the virus .
The night had the virus , she was born with the virus .
And here she &apos;s seven years old weighing no more than a one-year-old baby .
And at this moment in her life she was fully suffering from AIDS , she had a pneumonia .
We met her in a hospital in Eastern Cape , spent a whole afternoon with her — a great girl .
The doctors and nurses were amazing .
They gave her very special food and cared for her most .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital because we shot her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So of course , this was a very exciting encounter and left us very charged with this beautiful experience of one girl , you know , this story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Abilia again .
And I get my hypotheses — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hypotheses on my hands .
They &apos;re counting , because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
That &apos;s the change that &apos;s happened .
Isn &apos;t that amazing ?
( Applause ) These Applause ) They are really doctors and nurses of the hospital who were concerned about diving .
And I realize that you appreciate the change .
So I want to tell you that every one of you in the audience if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to get good food and good health care and you believe that the development goals of the thousand specifically five and six should be completely committed by all governments in the world especially in Southern Africa , please stand on your feet .
I think it &apos;s pretty accurate that it &apos;s almost everybody in this room .
Thank you very much .

Fifty years ago in the former Soviet Union , a group of scientists led to a large bone marrow through a bloody rural area .
With him , they hoped to capture people &apos;s brains everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
The rocket was huge in size .
And his regret was a silver pellet with two transmitters in it .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russians wrote at the same time : &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to create a new universe that &apos;s called Sputnik .
In the early days , countries like Sco Digma and Columbus were lucky in exposing the land world .
Now we &apos;re very lucky in exposing space .
And it will be the role of the future people to jealousy in our happiness . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching segments from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary , almost complete .
He describes the story of Sputnik , and what happened to America as a result of it .
For days after launch , Sputnik was a curious and wonderful thing .
A man-made moon that ordinary citizens can see , it inspired an awe and pride that humans would eventually live into space .
But only three days later , the day that the Red Monday neighborhood , the media and politicians told us , and we believed them , Sputnik was evidence that our enemies had surpassed us in science and technology , and now they are able to surround us with hydrogen outbreaks , while using their Sputnik castle as an interland castle .
The champagne is chaos .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three tentacles that went to America — equals its power , for historians , for Pearl Harbor or 11.9 .
He woke up the rocket gap .
He inflated the arms race .
He started the race to space .
Within a year , Congress has funded huge weapons , and our number of nuclear weapons has grown from 1,200 to 20,000 .
And the response to Sputnik has traded beyond growing weapons .
For example , some of you will remember this day , June 1958 , the national security exercise , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went down underground .
Or the Gallup survey that showed that seven out of 10 Americans believed that nuclear war would spread , and that at least 50 percent of our population would die .
But Sputnik also made wonderful changes .
For example , some of the residents of this room have learned in school about a scholarship after Sputnik .
Support the engineering professions , math and science — education generally — has grown rapidly .
Vincent Serff claims that Sputnik led directly to Earth and the Internet , and of course , NASA .
My documentary film shows how a free society can rape in panic because who know how to use the medium of communication .
But it also shows us how we can turn what initially looks like a bad situation , into something that was generally very good for America .
&quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will be released soon to the hackers .
To conclude , I &apos;d like to thank one of my investors : a TED artist for a long time , Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .

Thank you , Chris .
Today , Ms. Bolly noticed in Connecticut where my soul lives and announced that I was &quot; regret , &quot; &quot; which means when it comes to expression and grammar I don &apos;t even think about it because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; regret . &quot; So when my professor asked a question , and my answer is written in the context of urban proposition , and when I &apos;m &quot; regret , &quot; &quot; So when my father says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what my mind is .
So when my son says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s good with you ? &quot; &quot; I just said , &quot; &quot; I just stole with these people but I &apos;m finished ! &quot; &quot; And sometimes in class I might stop the slide that sounds intellectually to ask , &quot; &quot; Yo ! Why are these books ever about my people ? &quot; Yes , I decided to address all three languages as an equal because I &apos;m &quot; &quot; Rosetta , &quot; &quot; but who controls the Bregrets ?
Because the English language is interior literacy as an endless change now you might think it &apos;s ignorance to speak broken English , but I &apos;m here to tell you that even Americans &quot; &quot; furniture &quot; sound silly to English , so when my professor comes to the neighborhood and says , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; I stop it and say , &quot; &quot; LA , you don &apos;t mean , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the right way to say goodbye , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t even say goodbye .
The word &quot; &quot; crazy &quot; never came before the present is simply an English principle . &quot; &quot; If I had the voice capacity I would sing every head of a mountain , every suburb , and every neighborhood because the only God of language is the one recorded in the creation of this word that means &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; is good . &quot; &quot; So I may not always come to you with a great speech , but don &apos;t perceive me by language , because I &apos;m speaking three languages .
And then switches so that I won &apos;t be bored afterwards sometimes I fight two languages while I use third in class and when I mix them mistakenly , I &apos;m a crazy strategy like ... I &apos;m cooking in the bathroom I know I should borrow your language because mine was a stolen , but you can &apos;t anticipate me to speak your own history while my broken words are spoken by somebody who just fed up of the history of my mentor .
I speak English broken so that the deep incisions can remind us that our current situation is not a mystery I am so tired of the negative images that affect my people then unless you saw him a bank survivor stop calling my hair so bad that I &apos;m tired of the unreasonable racist diversity so don &apos;t call it good unless your hair is known as a charity , like our people , how can you view it as a homeless language , so it is not be .
It &apos;s not about promoting ignorance that &apos;s a linguistic celebration , so I put &quot; speak three languages &quot; &quot; on my previous line of acceptance , I can divert your consumer marketplace is all I want them to know and when they call me interview I &apos;ll be more happy to show that I can say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s good ? &quot; &quot; And of course ... &quot; Hello , &quot; because I &apos;m &quot; Rosetta . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

Good morning . So magic is a great way to stay in front of the reality curve , to allow us today what science will become a reality tomorrow .
As a cyber magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us the sense of how we experience future technologies .
You &apos;ve all heard of the Glass Project for Google .
It &apos;s a new technology . You look through them and the world that you see is enriched in data : names of places , sculptures , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers sharing to your side on the street .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
And when you look through them , you get a glimpse to the brain of a cyber magician .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a game card . Every card will fit .
Here . And let me mark it so that we can recognize it when we see it again .
All right . Simon Bolt .
Let &apos;s bring it back to the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s start .
( Music ) System : The system is ready . Take a picture .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a piece of cards are made up of four different sets : heart , clubs , diamond , and cost .
The cards are the ancient ones in the symbols , and they got many different interpretations .
Now , some say four definitions , the four seasons .
These are spring , summer , fall and ... System : My favorite season is winter . Marco : Yes , also on me .
winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when heat becomes cold , water for snow , and then everything goes away .
There are 13 cards in each series . ( Music ) System : Every card represents a phase in 13 moonshot cycles .
Marco : So here it &apos;s a depression , and here &apos;s a tide , and in the middle it &apos;s the moon .
System : The Moon is one of the most dominant features of the magic .
Marco : There are two colors in a piece of cards .
There &apos;s the red color and the black color , which symbolizes the eternal change from day to night .
System : Marco , I didn &apos;t know you could do it . ( Laughter ) Marco : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in the deck , like there are 52 weeks a year ?
( Music ) System : If you like all the symbols in a piece of cards , the result is 365 .
Marco : Oh , 365 , the number of days a year , the number of days between birthday .
Vote a wish . ( Drums ) A system : Don &apos;t find out , or it won &apos;t adapt .
Marco : Well , actually , it was my sixth birthday where I got my first piece of cards , and since that day , I &apos;ve traveled around the world doing magic for children and girls , men and women , husbands and ideas , and even queens and queens . ( Applause ) System : And who is that ? Marco : Ah , pink . Look .
Wake up .
Jocker : Whoa . Marco : Are you ready for a party ?
Jocker : Ready ! Marco : Let &apos;s see what you have .
Jocker : I show my pogo stick . Marco : Ah , caution .
Jocker : Whoa , ooh , ooh , ooh ! ( Music ) Marco : But today , I do a different kind of audience .
I do it for you .
System : A cash card identifies . Marco : Well , sometimes people ask me , how would you be a magician ? Is it a job of nine to five ?
Of course not ! You have to train 24 / 7 .
I don &apos;t mean literally 24 hours , seven days a week .
Twenty-seven is a little bit of an enterprise , but it requires training . Now , people will say , yes , cosms , it must be the work of some bad trap . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
Well , that &apos;s what I say , no .
In fact , in German it &apos;s interesting . ( Laughter ) Magic is not that powerful . I have to warn you , if you ever play with someone who distributes cards in such a way , don &apos;t bet on money .
( Music ) System : Why not ? It &apos;s a great hand .
The chances of getting it are 4,165 to one .
Marco : Yeah , but my hand is better . We won the odds .
System : I think you &apos;ve got your birthday wish . Marco : And it leaves me with the latest and most important card : the ticket with this very important symbol .
And nothing like anything we just saw , virtual or not .
Marco Digital : That &apos;s certainly the real thing .
Marco : Bye Bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years , and I &apos;ve gone to TED I .
And the third is a little bit less clear .
Did they all agree ? No , not really .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
I have so much money . I can keep playing forever .
I grew up in the poorest country in India , Behar . I remember when I was six years old , I came home one day and found a cart filled with delicious candy on the doorstep .
I and my brothers were buried in a cart and then my father came home .
He was filled with outrage , and I still remember how we cried when the cart with the candy that half of them had already eaten , taken away from us .
I later realized why my father was so upset .
These tensions were a contractor bribe trying to raise my father to give him a government contract .
My father was responsible for building roads in Bahar and he took a robust position against corruption , despite harassment and threats .
He was lonely in Mahabo , because Bahar was also the most corrupt country in India , where government officials would enrich themselves , instead of serving the poor who didn &apos;t have the tools to express their mental illnesses if their children didn &apos;t have food or school .
I experienced it in a very concrete way when I went to remote villages to study poverty .
And when I went from village to village , I remember one day , when I was hungry and exhausted , and I was soon collapsed , sitting in the hot heat slowing beneath the tree , just then , one of the poor residents in that village invited me into his hut and he rarely fed me .
It wasn &apos;t until later that I realized that what he gave me was the food for all his family .
This farm of extreme generosity has been challenged to see my purpose in life and changed it .
I made a determined decision to give back .
Later , I joined the World Bank , who asked to fight poverty like this by moving aid from rich countries to poor countries .
My first job was in Uganda , where I focused on negotiating with the Uganda Ministry of Finance on reforms so that they would be entitled to our loans .
But after we gave them the loans , I remember a journey in Uganda where I found schools that had just been built without textbooks or teachers , new clinics without drugs , and the poor again without expression and without aid .
I mean , it was like Bahar .
Bahar represents the challenge of development : poverty frustrating and surrounded by corruption .
All over the world , 1.3 billion people live on less than 1.25 dollars a day , and the work I &apos;ve done in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems and implemented since 1944 , when the winners in World War II , the 500 founding fathers , and if one founder of one , have gathered in New Hampshire , the United States , to set up institutions in Brton and Ds , including the World Bank .
In the traditional approach to development there were three ingredients : First , transferring resources from rich countries in northern poor countries in the south , accompanied with prescriptions for reforms .
The second , the development institutions that made these resources were not really transparent , with small transparency for what they funded or the results they achieved .
And third , the involvement in developing countries was in a short framework of government elites with small contact with the citizens , which is actually the final goal of development aid .
Today , each of these components is starting to change because of dramatic changes in the global environment .
Open knowledge , open aid , open government , which together , represents three key changes that change the nature of development and that gives hope about the problems I &apos;ve seen in Uganda and Bahar .
The first key change is open knowledge .
The developing countries today don &apos;t just have to accept solutions that are replaced by the United States , Europe or the World Bank .
They get their inspiration , their hope , their knowledge and their practical experience , grocery and successful economies from the South .
They want to know how China has lifted 500 million people out of poverty within 30 years , how the Oportland dates program of Mexico has improved education and the diet of millions of children .
This is the new open-knowledge ecosystem , not just a journey from north to south , but from south to the South , even from south to north , like with the Opunt dadgers program of Mexico that inspires New York City today .
And while transferring such messages from north to south is opening , so are the development institutions that transcend these transfers .
And that &apos;s the second transformation : open aid .
Recently , the World Bank has opened its data to public use in liberating 8,000 economic and social indicators of 200 countries , collected over 50 years , and this has launched a worldwide competition for crowdsourcing innovative applications through this data .
Today , development institutions are also exposed to public criticism on the projects they fund .
Let &apos;s take GeoMing . In this map of Kenya , the red dots show where all the funded schools are contributing , and the higher the diversity of green is , the more children there are not going to school .
So this simple exhibition reveals that donors haven &apos;t funded any school in areas where there are most kids left out of school , which brings up new questions . Is development aid actually there to target those who need our help most ?
Similarly the World Bank has now mapped 30,000 projects in 143 countries , and donors are using this shared platform to map all their projects .
This is a big leap forward in terms of transparency and accountability on aid .
That leads me to the third transformation , and I think , the most significant change in development : openness of government . Governments today are developing as citizens are prosecuted to play their voice and accountability .
From the Arab Spring to the movement of Hazara in India , through mobile phones and social networks , not only to demand accountability on political issues but also to demand responsibility for development .
Like , do governments provide services to citizens ?
So for example , some governments in Africa and East Europe reveal their budget to the public .
But as you know , there &apos;s a big difference between public budget and budget that is accessible and understandable .
It &apos;s a public budget . ( Laughter ) As you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to the ordinary citizen who &apos;s trying to understand how government is taking advantage of its resources .
To deal with this problem , governments use new tools to make the budget more visual and so more obvious for the public .
In this map from Moldova , the green color shows the quarters with low spending on schools but with good educational results . The red color shows the opposite .
Such tools help make entire documents not understood , to something visual and obvious to the general public , and what &apos;s exciting is that with openness , there are new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and be in touch with government .
So , in the Philippines today , students and parents can give real-time feedback on site , CheckysChool.org , or through SMS , whether the teachers and textbooks are in school , the same problems that I &apos;ve noticed in Uganda and Bahar .
And the government is poor . So for example , when a report on the site was that 800 students were at risk because the repairs in the school were shaped by corruption , the Ministry of Education in the Philippines took a quick action .
And what &apos;s exciting about the whole story is that this innovation is now spreading from south to south , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and even beyond .
In Dar Al Salaam , Tanzania , even a poor community was able to use these tools to express its aspirations .
This is what Tandale map looked like in August 2011 , but within a few weeks , the students were able to use mobile phones and open-source platforms to fundamentally map the entire community infrastructure .
And what &apos;s very exciting is that citizens were then able to feedback the dots of clinics or water supply that didn &apos;t work — concentrated in red bubbles , which provide a graphic view of the collective voice of the poor .
Today , even Bahar is changing for the better and evolving under a commitment leadership that makes government transparent , accessible and as opposed to the poor .
But , in many parts of the world , governments don &apos;t want to open or serve the poor , and it &apos;s a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are the only warriors like my father and many others , and the key frontier of development work is to help those who are fighting alone , to put hands together and can overcome the difficulties .
So for example , today in Ghana , brave reformers from the public service , parliament and government , have created a coalition for transparent contracts in oil , which is a reformant reformant in Parliament to study dubious contracts .
These examples provide new hope , new possibilities for the kind of problems I &apos;ve seen in Uganda or the problems my father was dealing with in Bahar .
Two years ago , on April 8 , 2010 , I called my father .
It was very late at night , and at 80 , Dad was in the middle of a 70-page representation against corruption in a road coil project .
Even though he wasn &apos;t a lawyer , he represented himself the case in a court the next day . He won the lawyer but later that evening , he died .
He fought to the end , with the enthusiasm that went up and increased , because to fight corruption and poverty , not only government officials should be straight , but citizens should come together to make their voices heard .
These became the two end markers of his book of life , and the journey he did between them reflected the changing landscape of development .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are exploring these new directions — a significant change compared to my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
We need fundamentally to bring the lottery over development so that knowledge will flow in different directions , which will inspire the businesses , and that &apos;s how aid will become transparent , to the extent that the government will become criticized and efficient , so that governments will open and citizens will engage in it and get reform encouragement in the government .
We need to accelerate those changes .
If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bahar , Uganda and beyond .
We &apos;ll find that textbooks and teachers will find in school for the children .
We &apos;ll find that those kids too , will be a real chance to break their way out of the poverty cycle .
Thank you . ( Applause )
So imagine that a plane was going to crash and within 250 children and babies , if you knew how to prevent it , would you do that ?
Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under the age of five crashing every day .
That &apos;s the number of kids who can &apos;t get to their fifth birthday .
Sixty-six million children can &apos;t get to their fifth birthday .
Most of these deaths are preventable , and it doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me weak .
Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the two great killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases is not what new technological innovations are .
This is one of the oldest inventions in the world : soap package .
A handshake of hands with soap , a leg that we all take for granted , can reduce stages in half , can reduce infections in the respiratory system .
Hands erosion in soap can affect the reduction of flu , nuclear , SARS , and recently in cases of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the most important interventions is a handshake in soap .
A handshake of hands in soap keeps kids in school .
It prevents babies dying .
Hands erosion in soap is one of the most effective ways to save children &apos;s lives .
It can save over 600,000 children every year .
It &apos;s worth stopping 10 jambo planes filled with babies and children crashing every day .
I think you &apos;ll agree with me that this is a relatively useful public health intervention .
So now take a moment .
I think you need to know the person sitting next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just press each other ?
Please shake hands .
Okay , meet each other .
They look very beautiful .
Okay .
So what if I told you that the person you took hands just a moment ago actually didn &apos;t shake his hands when he came out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so beautiful now , right ?
You will agree with me that it &apos;s relatively disgusting .
Well , the truth is that statistics show that four out of five people don &apos;t run their hands when they come out of the toilet , around the world .
And in the same way , we don &apos;t do that when we have great toilets , running water , and soap in reach , that &apos;s the same in countries where child deaths are really high .
What &apos;s the problem ? No soap ?
The truth is , there is soap in reach .
In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent in Kenya , you will find soap .
Even in countries where the least likely soap is , like Ethiopia , we &apos;re standing on 50 percent .
Why is that ?
Why don &apos;t people wash their hands ?
Why Minck , the young man I met in India , does not wash his hands ?
Well , in Inc &apos;s family , you use soap to run , you use soap to wash , you use soap to wash instruments .
His parents sometimes think it &apos;s an expensive commodity , so they keep it in the closet .
They keep it away from it so they don &apos;t waste it .
On average , in a family of Inc , they use soap to wash hands one day in the best case , and sometimes even one per week .
What are the results of this ?
Children are infected with disease where they &apos;re supposed to be loved and protected , in their home .
Think where you &apos;ve learned to wash your hands .
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn to wash hands in school ?
I think behavior scientists will tell you it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you developed early on .
However , we all copy what everybody does and social norms sometimes are something that affects how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this soap to protect their family .
Many women in India will tell you that they &apos;re learning everything about hygiene , disease , this soap rocket from the Libukoy brand .
Aicon brands like this have the responsibility to do well in places where they sell their products .
This belief , and the size of Unilever , which enables us to continue talking about washing hands with soap and hygiene with these mothers .
Big , brittle businesses can change and maximize the social norms and make change in those habits is so central .
Think about it : marketers spend all their time passing us from a brand to a brand .
And in fact , they know how to make science and work for convincing messages .
Just for a moment , imagine when they combine all their power behind a strong message like a handbag with a soap .
The driver of profits changes health outcomes in this world .
But this happens for hundreds of the Lifest buoy brand launched in 1894 in Victorian England to fight cholera .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the Minister of Health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera epidemic in Ghana right now .
One hundred and eight years later , the solution is the same solution : is to ensure they have access to this protein , and they use it , because that &apos;s the number one way to stop the cholera epidemic from spreading .
I think this drive for profit is particularly powerful , sometimes more powerful than the charity organization or the most determined government .
The government does what it can , especially in cases of epidemics like cholera , or Ebola right now , but with priorities competing .
The budget isn &apos;t always there .
And when you think about it , you think about what it takes to make a droplet of hands a daily habit , it requires extensive funding to encode this habit .
In short , these are the fighting for public health actually depend on soap societies to keep pushing hands with soap .
We have friends like USAID , the Global Public Public Collaboration for Sabbon , the London School of Engineering and tropical drugs , Plan , WaterhAid all believe in a unique profit partnership .
The public sector profit , because we can help them reach their goals .
A profit for the private sector , because we &apos;re building new generations of future hand-washing .
And most importantly , a gap for fragility .
On October 15th , we &apos;re going to celebrate the international handshake day .
School , communities , we partnered with the public sector and partnered with the private sector — yes , on this day even our competitors , joined us to celebrate the most important public health intervention in the world .
What it takes , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is to come up with a lot of creative thinking about support leaders .
If you take our Help Child Campaign , we &apos;ve made great films that bring the message that washes hands with soap to the simple citizen in the way that it can connect .
We had over 30 million views .
Most of these discussions still exist online .
I urge you to take five minutes and watch these movies .
I come from Mali , one of the poorest countries in the world .
I grew up in a family where every conversation at dinner was about social justice .
I went to the leading school in Europe for public health .
I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with a degree in health and the only one who did a PhD on a handbag with soap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Ninety-nine years ago , I decided , with a successful career in public health in emergence , that I could make the biggest change in selling and market the best product in public health : soap .
We now run the world &apos;s largest hand-washing program at all the standards about public health .
We &apos;ve reached a factory of 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambition to go to billion by 2020 .
For the last four years , big businesses in a double-digit number , while child mortality has declined in all places where soap use has increased .
Maybe it &apos;s not pleasant for people to hear but growth in business and saving lives somehow have been compared in the same sentence — but that growth in business is allowing us to continue doing more .
Without it , and without talking about it , we can &apos;t achieve the change we need .
Last week , my team and I spent visiting mothers who experienced the same thing : a baby die that was just born .
I &apos;m a mother . I can &apos;t imagine a more powerful and painful thing .
This mother is from Myanmar .
She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you get a second chance .
Her son , Mario , he built the other one .
She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks old , and we know that most of the children who die from one month to the first month of their lives , and we know that if we bring soap to every child and if we use soap before we touch the babies , we can reduce and change in terms of those numbers .
And this is what inspires me , inspires me to continue this task , to know that I can hunt her in what it takes for her to do the beautiful work in the world : to cultivate her baby .
And the next time you think about a gift to a young mother and her family , don &apos;t look very far : buy her soap .
The most wonderful invention in public health .
I hope you &apos;ll join us and make your handbag part of your life and some of our everyday lives and help kids like Mother to get to the fifth birthday .
Thank you .

These are the things that the genocide victims in Bosnia have been carried with in the last time .
And it &apos;s certainly the biggest grave that &apos;s ever been exposed .
Over the course of the four years of conflict that devastated Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , about 30,000 people , especially citizens , disappeared , and the premise was that they were murdered , and 100,000 others were killed during battle .
The International Criminal Court issued several lawyers about crime against humanity and genocide .
If genocide was killed .
He &apos;s also the destruction of the killing property , of their cultural heritage , and finally , the extinction of every male that ever existed .
The genocide is not just killing ; it &apos;s the denial of identity .
There are always traces — there &apos;s no perfect crime .
There are always remains of those who have been extinct that their resilience is greater than their fragile body resistance and their fuzzy blood in our selective memory .
It &apos;s not allowed to let one body stay bored or unidentified .
Once they were collected , these items , that the victims were carried with them on their way to their execution get a rigorous cleaning , to examine , to Kitalva and to store .
Thousands of items are packaged in nylon bags to build just like these in CSA series .
Occasionally invite the survivors to try and identify these objects inevitably , but the unseen view is extremely difficult , and it &apos;s an inefficient and painful process .
Once zip experts , doctors and clinicians ended up with these details , they become the myths of this story .
Many of them are destroyed , believe it or not , or just put on shelves , far from the eye and far from the heart .
I want more than to raise awareness .
The photography is about to inspire empathy , and the acknowledgment of these items ensures empathy .
Once all of the youth are identified , there will only be the fancy carcasses in these communities and everyday objects .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;d like to show you something that I &apos;m working on .
There are some things I learned when I did my 30-day challenges today .
It was part of the challenge I made to take a picture every day of the month .
I &apos;ve never been so adventurous .
It &apos;s terrible .
In fact , they &apos;re really fun .
( Applause )
Hello , today I &apos;m going to share with you some jobs I &apos;m doing today .
Because we &apos;re still learning the works , we &apos;re mostly operating in the field of intuition and mystery , right now .
I &apos;m going to try to describe some of the experiences that we aspire to in each of these works .
The first job is called Improvial Monoches .
A visitor goes into the room and sees these balloons that are in a messy position on the wall .
In seconds , as if the warriors felt in the presence of the refrigerator , and they were supposedly wobbling and doing fine with my mouths .
( Laughter ) This is a two-step sketch .
One is in a completely chaotic state and the other is in complete order .
We were interested in looking at how a small change is small enough to move from one state to another .
It also reminded us of two very different traditions in the painting .
One is the 15th century kitchen plate , and the second of about 100 years ago , the abstract works of a collection .
Now I &apos;m going to show you a video .
To give you an idea of the measurements . The biggest plate is about two feet tall .
It &apos;s kind of like this . And the smallest one is A4 .
The critic goes into space , and they go to red .
After a while , if the critic continues to stay in space , the warriors become a kind of resilience to the visitor presence and come back to be synonymous and independent , until they &apos;re again feeling comfortable or locomotion in the room , and then they &apos;re going to move to red again .
( Laughter ) It looks like the critic is that awakens the sense of order in the guards , but it can also be the opposite , which is , the guidelines are stuck in their prosthetic behaviors and they &apos;re impressed by criticizing the function of control .
This leads me to a little work , a little bit more quiet called hand-holding .
The viewer sees a sheet of paper glued on the far end of the wall , but when you zoom in , you see that it &apos;s a blank sheet of A4 , or like that , held on two little sides of two little hands that look like they were rubbing a lot of investment and a lot of talent from a little piece of wood .
The viewer also sees that all this gear is moving a little bit , like these hands are trying to hold the paper in a stable state for a long time , and they &apos;re not so successful at it .
Instability is very similar to the unstable nature of imagery imaged by hand .
Now I &apos;m going to show you two follow-up videos .
One of them is a mobile camera and the other is a handshake .
And you immediately see how the unstable nature of the video suggests the presence of a viewer and a subjective perspective .
We now downloaded the camera and transferred it into the board itself .
Here &apos;s the video .
Imagine the second hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
But we , like , are trying to stimulate self-effectiveness , like there &apos;s a little man with his hands clutching behind this big paper sheet .
It represents as much the size of the effort invested in the viewer to show his face the paper as he held his hands .
Next job is lure .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about my altitude .
It has a circular body , two arms , and a very high head-shaped antenna , and its only goal is to attract attention .
When you go by somebody , they swing off the side , and they move their arms in increasing mirrors as the person gets closer .
So here &apos;s a test case .
You see the two movements in the intestine , and the object seems to be using its whole experience of expressing its beliefs , but the idea is .
Once it gets attention , it loses interest and searches for the next person to win its attention .
( Laughter ) This is the final shape of the physical body .
It looks like it creates a mass-production and came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
It &apos;s because we always work out of a very personal space , we love how the custom-driven design makes the object irresilient and gives us remoteness , at least in its head .
So for us it &apos;s a negative manufacturing that &apos;s trying to get us away from the things that really require our attention , but it can also be a character that needs help .
The next job is an object , which is also a kind of device for sound sound .
In the form of amphitheater , its size fits to contain an audience as it looks from the stage .
Where I &apos;m standing , each of you looks this size , and the audience fills all my visual field .
It &apos;s 96 little characters in the audience .
They &apos;re mechanically capable of applauding the free filter .
That means each of them can decide whether and when she wants to clap , how powerful and how long , how they want to be influenced by others around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
So when the viewer walks in front of the audience , there will be a response .
It can be a single hand or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and then again the audience will react .
It could be anything that &apos;s twice as weak as the people in the audience , or it could be a high return .
So we look at the audience as an independent body or an independent organism that also has a kind of musical ability , a kind of instrument .
The viewer can play by producing sound patterns or rather complex musical patterns , but it can &apos;t inspire the audience any particular reaction .
So it involves feelings of judgment , mercy and inconvenience .
It also has a trait of temptation , a kind of trap .
Here you can see that we &apos;re excited about the head splitting and creating two hands .
Here &apos;s a little animation , like the two sides of the brain collide each other to actually express the seconds and stress .
Here &apos;s the prototype .
We don &apos;t have patience to wait for 96 of them to flood us .
This is the last job . It &apos;s called Framernuners .
It &apos;s the product of the idea of a window .
This is a real window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made of three different depths of wood parts .
We used the same recipe of a window to build a framework that is divided by sources that depend on the room and can be seen on both sides .
This framework is populated with the collection of little characters .
They come in three sizes , to give a sense of perspective or land bytes on a plane .
Each of these characters can move back or forward within the trajectory and hide between two hidden paths .
In contrast to this very rigid framework , we wanted to give these characters a very hideous , kind of hippie character , as if a puppeteer took them and discouraged life .
We love the idea that these characters leapfrog into them like this , like they &apos;re kind of environmental , lack of fear , complacency and sunflowers in the nest , until they feel movement on the viewer and then they hide behind the nearest wall .
For us , this work represents its own internal contradiction .
These characters are like trapped inside this rigid framework , which is like a prison , but also a safe concentration , because it also allows them to be worthless and divorced into the outside world .
All of these characteristics of the real world I &apos;ve been talking about have been translated into a very specific technical form , and we &apos;re lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
They removed the two-wheels from our animations and created fluctuations that combined a steep-down movement of the head and the backward prefrontal locomotion .
This is a pretty small school .
And you can see it goes into my palm .
So think about what excitement we had when we saw this actually works in the studio .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
When I learned in college , I did a degree in government , which means I had to write a lot of jobs .
Well , when a normal student writes a job , it might distribute the work about the following way .
So , you know — ( Laughter ) You start usually slowly , but you can do enough in the first week so that even with a few more busy days later , all the work is done and things remain relaxed . ( Laughter )
And I really would like to do things like this .
It &apos;s supposed to be the plan .
I was ready to start by the program , but then , actually , it would come the work , and I did pretty much the next thing .
( Laughter ) And it would happen in every work I had to make .
But then my thesis work came , 90 pages old , a document that you should work on for a whole year .
And I knew for that kind of work , there was no way of working in my normal method .
It was too big a project .
So I designed everything , and I decided I would take the next method .
This is what the year was supposed to look like .
I &apos;m going to start with the sticks , and in the months I &apos;m going to give some gas , and then , towards the end , I &apos;m going to step up high , just like a little staircase .
How hard is it supposed to be , going up the staircase ?
Not a big story , right ?
But then , a funny clip happened .
Those first months ?
They just came and went , and I couldn &apos;t really do anything .
So I came up with a really cool , exciting program .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) But then , these two months of middle just passed by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and eventually I found myself here .
And then two months became them one month , which became two weeks .
And one day I woke up with three days to the Depression date , and since I hadn &apos;t written a word yet , I did the only thing I could do : I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours , appealing not to a white coat , but two white nights — human beings aren &apos;t supposed to attract two white nights — I crossed the campus in a handful of lightning , carved in slow motion and made the exact same time .
I thought that &apos;s where the story ended .
But a week later I got a call from college .
And they say to me , &quot; &quot; Did I come to Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis work . &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And then they say , &quot; This is the best job we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It didn &apos;t happen . ( Laughter )
It was a really bad job , but really bad . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy one moment , when you all thought to yourself , &quot; This guy &apos;s amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was a very bad job .
Anyway , today I &apos;m a guy writing blogs online .
I write the blog : Wait Bubot Whole .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
My behavior has always embarked on the non-procrastinators around me , and I wanted to explain to all the non-procrastinators in the world , what &apos;s going on inside the head of a procrastinator , and why we behave as we behave .
Well , I had a hypothesis , that the brains of procrastinators are actually different from other people &apos;s brains .
And to put the hypothesis into the test , I found an MRI lab that agreed that I would scan my brain and another person &apos;s brain , which is unproven , so I could compare them to each other .
And I brought them with me today , to show you .
I want you to test them for a moment fundamentally and see if you notice the difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained brain expert , it &apos;s not that simple , but I want you to try . Okay ?
So — here we see an undifferentiated brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) Well , there &apos;s a difference .
In both brains , there are rational decision-making rhythms , but in the mind of the eye there &apos;s also the immediate skepticism .
So , what does that mean for the eye ?
Well , that means everything is fine — until it happens .
&#91; It &apos;s exactly time to go to work . &#93; &#91; No , it &apos;s not ! &#93; The rational decision will make the rational decision to do something useful . But the monkey doesn &apos;t like this program . So he takes over the wheel , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , let &apos;s read the whole page on Wikipedia that &apos;s about Nancy Cragan and Tonia Hardig , because I just remembered it happened .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll get up and go to the refrigerator , see if something has been restored there in the last 10 minutes .
Then we go into a YouTube mix that starts with Richard Feynman &apos;s videos talking about magnets and ends a lot , much later when we watch interviews with Justin Bieber &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) All of this is going to take quite a while , so we &apos;re not really going to have a school to do some work .
&quot; Stop ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) So what &apos;s actually going on here ?
The immediate monkey doesn &apos;t look like someone you &apos;d like behind the wheel .
It lives at the very present moment .
He has no past memory , he &apos;s unaware of the future , and he cares only two things : easy and fun .
Now , in the animal world — it works beautifully .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life making easy and fun things , then you &apos;ve succeeded in life !
( Laughter ) And for the monkey , humans are just another animal species .
All you have to do is sleep well , eat well , pretend offspring , things that in the age that we live in tribes , really matched us .
But , in case you haven &apos;t noticed — we &apos;re not in our tribal age anymore .
We live in the advanced culture , and the monkey has no idea what that means .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re sitting in another person in the brain , this guy — making rational decisions , allowing us to do things that no other animal can do .
We can see the future in our minds .
We can see the big picture .
We can design long-term plans .
And we want to take all of these into account .
And he wants to make us do what makes sense to do right now .
Well , sometimes it really makes sense to do what &apos;s easy and fun , like when you eat dinner or you go to sleep or have a free time ago that you earned in happiness .
This is the area where we have an overlap .
Sometimes — they agree with each other .
But sometimes , it makes a lot more sense to do difficult and less pleasant things , to promote the Great image .
And this is where we have disagreement .
And for the sake , this disagreement tends to end in the same way every time , makes it spend a lot of time in this orange area , a light and fun place that &apos;s completely out of the logical circle .
I call this place the Apple Games gene .
( Laughter ) Now , the dark game garden is a place where all the procrastinators , with your right , are very familiar with .
This is where leisure activities are happening , at times when leisure activities are not supposed to happen .
The fun that you &apos;re experiencing in the dark game gene , it &apos;s not really fun , because you &apos;ve totally not earned it , and the air there is mostly guilt , horror , anxiety , self-jealousy — all the familiar , well-known , procrastinated emotions .
And the question is , in this situation , when the monkey is the concentration of leadership , how can the eye get itself all over here , to this blue area , a place that is much less nice , but where does the really important things happen ?
Well , it turns out that Darwin has a guardian angel , someone who &apos;s always been talking about and maintaining his hardest moments — someone called the panic monster .
( Laughter ) Now , the choir monster sleeps most of the time , but suddenly every time a last goal for doing work comes too close or there &apos;s a danger to be embarrassed in the public , a career agenda , or some other threatening outcome .
And most importantly , it &apos;s the only thing a monkey is afraid of .
Well , she became very relevant in my life , very recently , because TED people contacted me about six months ago and invited me to give a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Now , obviously I said yes .
It was always my dream , knowing I had given a TED Talk before .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But during all this excitement , the rational decision-making seems to think about something else .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Tell me , we understand what we &apos;ve got on ourselves right now ?
Do we get what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We have to sit down and start working on it now . And the monkey said , &quot; &quot; Totally agree with you , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth for a moment and focus on the intersection of the Indian subcontinent , about 200 feet above the surface , and then we &apos;ll release the mouse north for two and a half hours until we get to the north of the country , so we can have a better sense of India . &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
Six months became four , then two months and then a month , and the TED people decided to publish the list of speakers .
And I opened the site and there — my face came up looking back at me .
And guess who woke up then ?
( Laughter ) So the choir monster started losing press and a few seconds later , the whole system was chaos . ( Laughter )
And the monkey — you know , he &apos;s terrified of the choir monster — boom ! He leaped to the top of the tree .
And finally , finally , rational decisions can take focus and I can start working on the lecture .
Now , a choir monster story can explain all sorts of unexpected types of procrastinating behavior , like for example how someone like me can spend two whole weeks without even writing a opening sentence , and then in a miracle finding the self-discipline to stay awake for a whole night to write eight pages .
And all of this situation that I described to God , with the three characters — this is what happens in the head of an eye .
It &apos;s not a pleasant play , but ultimately , it works .
This is what I decided to write on a blog a few years ago .
And when I wrote , I was amazed by the comments .
I got thousands of email messages , from all sorts of people from all over the world , working in all sorts of things .
There were sisters , bankers , painters , engineers , and lots of Ph.D.
( Laughter ) And they all wrote the exact same thing : &quot; I &apos;m suffering / death from the exact same problem . &quot;
But what struck me was the contrast between the audio atmosphere of post and the respect of email reaction messages .
These people wrote out of a huge frustration and told about what the procrastinations were going on in their lives , about what this monkey was going on to them .
And I thought about it and I said to myself , if the system of inflection works as a line , then what &apos;s going on here ?
Why are all these people in such a dark place ?
So it turns out there are two types of procrastination .
All I &apos;ve been talking about today , all the examples I &apos;ve given , all of them had a date .
And when there &apos;s a target date , the effects of procrastinations exist in the short term , because the panel monster intervenes .
But there &apos;s another kind of procrastination that works in cases where there &apos;s no destination date .
So if you want a career that you drive yourself — something in the art realm , something entrepreneurial — there &apos;s no date I started these things , because nothing happens at the beginning , until you get up and decide to do the hard work of getting the momentum , of driving things .
There are all sorts of important things beyond your career that don &apos;t involve any destination processes , like seeing with your family , exercising or taking care of your health , cultivating your relationship or getting out of a connection that doesn &apos;t work .
Now , if the only mechanism of making these difficult things is a panel monster , then there &apos;s a problem , because in all of these situations , there &apos;s no target date , the panel monster doesn &apos;t appear .
It doesn &apos;t have to wake up , so the effects of procrastinating don &apos;t die . They just land to them forever .
And this is this kind of procrastination , in the long term that is less visible and less is the kind of short-term and funny kind , based on a destination date .
And they usually suffer silence and privacy .
And it can be the source of enormous amounts of misery and regrets over the long term .
And I thought to myself , that &apos;s why all the email messages people sent me , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re deaf now towards some project .
The long-term procrastination made them transparent , in their own lives .
The frustration is not because they couldn &apos;t fulfill their dreams , but because they couldn &apos;t even start chasing them .
So I read these email messages and I had a little epiphany — I don &apos;t think there are any non-procrastinators at all .
That &apos;s right — I think you &apos;re all procrastinators .
Now , you may not be in the Belgians , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you have a healthy relationship with destiny dates , but remember : the most dirty exercise of the monkey is when the destination dates are not there .
Now , I want to show you one last thing .
I call this a lifesaver .
There &apos;s one box here for every week in life 90 years old .
Not so many boxes in total , especially with the fact that we &apos;ve already used some of them .
So I think we all need to have a long , tracking perspective on this day .
We need to think about the things we procrastinate for , because each of us takes a procrastination about something in life .
We need to stay aware of the immediate satisfaction monkey .
That &apos;s our mission , of all of us .
And because there &apos;s not so many boxes there , it &apos;s a task we should probably start today .
Well , maybe not really today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sometime soon .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Everything is upside down to us , right ?
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
That &apos;s why the army attracts them .
It turned out to me that the environment is determining , and if the environment is right , each and every one of us has the ability to do these amazing things , and more importantly , others have this ability .
Why did you do that ? &quot; And everybody was the same answer : &quot; Because they would do it for me . &quot;
The problem with concepts like trust and collaboration , is that they are emotions and not instructions .
I can &apos;t just tell you , trust me .
So , where does this emotion come from ?
It wasn &apos;t personal .
They have benefits in them .
A bad system of survival .
These can be the tides and the depression in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
There &apos;s no control over these forces .
So I started the mouth .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you treat us as a herd ?
The reason we like to fly in Southwest Airlines is not necessarily because they employ better people .
It &apos;s because people there are not afraid of their leaders .
They want to give people an opportunity , education , discipline when you need to , develop their own confidence , give them opportunities to try and fail , so that they can get more of us and more than we want for ourselves .
Never .
That &apos;s the exact opposite .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s the fact that they &apos;ve violated the very definition of leadership .
They violated this ancient social contract .
We know that they let their people fall over their interest altar , or worse , really sacrificed their people so they could keep their interests .
That &apos;s the thing that &apos;s so hurting us , not the numbers .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save the numbers .
They had to save 10 million dollars , so like many companies these days , the executive member got together and discussed the fired issue .
All the workers , from the secretary to the CEO , had to go out for four weeks unpaid leave .
But the way Bob announced the plan was that it was so significant .
They saved 20 million dollars , and more importantly , as people might expect when people feel safe and protected by the leadership of the organization , the natural response is to trust and to cooperate .
Those who could afford to replace those who could less afford it .
People went out to five weeks of vacation , so someone else could only go out to three .
Leadership is a choice , not a degree .
Such a leader .
We call these people leaders because they &apos;re heading .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before everyone else .
We call them leaders because they will always choose to sacrifice themselves so that their people are safe and protected , and for their people to go out and hire , and when we do that , the natural response will be that our people will sacrifice for us .
They will give us blood , sweat and tears to predict the visions of a leader , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why did you do that ?
The most complex problems of our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we can dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is key to moving dreams into reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Technihr , a Jewish refugee who sat at the heart of the Andes Mountains .
And so I grew up , I was raised to see beyond any limitation .
Some of my education has helped my grandmother in remote indigenous communities .
I remember them in love , because they helped me understand life outside the city , living with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , like language or culture .
During those journeys , my grandmother used to quote a song of Kipling : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and search it .
Go and look beyond the mountains .
&quot; &quot; Something lost beyond the mountains .
&quot; Lost and wait for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the next few years , I started studying medicine .
One in 100 children in the world was born with some heart disease .
And there &apos;s part of the problem that I can solve — some of the problem that I &apos;ve dedicated my life to .
The problem begins during pregnancy .
The fetus should survive in the womb of his mother .
Its survival depends on the connection between the peripheral and temporal blood system .
At the moment of birth , this connection has to be blocked .
If it doesn &apos;t save , the baby will have a hole in the heart .
It &apos;s a situation caused by pandemics and genetic factors .
But now we know that oxygen shortage also leads to the problem .
As you can see on the chart , the prevalence of the hole in the heart is dramatically rising in high places .
Video : ( Baby crying ) When you see patients like this , they seem to be desperate in the air .
To close the hole , they used to do big heart surgeries .
One night , my friend Melta and I , we set up a camp in the Amazon area .
The only material that wasn &apos;t burned on fire was green Aborcado branches .
And then inspired us .
And we used the bucku branches as a pattern for our first invention .
It &apos;s meant to block the hole in the heart of babies .
Sil is a piece of metal overlap itself .
It may not seem impressive right now , but it was our first successful attempt to build a medical instruments that would solve the problem .
In the video , you can see a tiny piano defining the sound to the heart .
And then the coil blocks the hole .
After that moment of inspiration , it took a huge effort to develop a prototype .
Experiments in the lab and animals took us thousands of hours of work in the lab .
The sound , if it works , will save lives .
I came back from Germany to Bolivia , I thought that everywhere we go , we could affect the better .
Together with my wife and collaborators , Dr. Alexandra Heathrow , we started looking at patients .
After we successfully treated patients with the coil , we were really excited .
But we live in a place that &apos;s three and a half kilometers high .
And the patients there need a special device to solve their heart problems .
Most patients can &apos;t afford time treatment , and they die .
Our first coil only handled half the patients in Bolivia .
We started looking again .
We went back to the workshop .
After many attempts , and with the indigenous friends of my grandmother living in the mountains , we created a new device .
For centuries , indigenous women have told stories by representing complex examples in the Volly Ariga , and this unique ability has helped us with new development .
We used the traditional jurisdiction method to design a smart materials device that learns shapes .
This time , the knitting will allow us to make a device without seatbelts that &apos;s not wiped because it &apos;s made of one unit .
And it changes its own form for complex forms in a process that has evolved for centuries .
As you can see , the device is converted into the body through the blood vessels .
The doctors just need to put the piano in the hole .
Our device expands , self-assembles and closes the hole .
We have an amazing , easy walking system to use because it works on its own .
And you don &apos;t need open heart surgery .
( Applause ) As doctors , we fight diseases that take a long time to cure — if we manage to cure them .
This is the child we saw before , after he passed the treatment .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is located , the patient is 100 percent healthier .
From the beginning to the end , the entire process only takes 30 minutes .
It &apos;s very satisfying with the medical and human test .
We &apos;re proud of the people we &apos;ve treated are now part of our team — and thanks to the close connection between us and our patients .
Together , we have one idea : the best solution should be simple .
We lost fear of creating something new .
The road wasn &apos;t easy .
A lot of hurdles were running all the time .
But we got power from our patients .
Their resilience and courage inspired us .
Our goal is to make sure that there is no child who is not treated , not because of cost or access to treatment .
So we have to set up a foundation in a one-to-one model .
We can make a free device to make sure all children are treated .
We work in many countries today , but we need to be everywhere .
Everything started with an impossible idea that would continue to guide us : every child would get treated .
Thank you .

I grew up in Puppo , in a border between Leffio and Mapuelanja , in a small town called Mottama .
The water supply and electricity was unpredictable like the weather , and when I grew up there in those harsh conditions , at 17 years old , I used to spend some of my friends in the winter , and we would burn in the sun .
Limpo &apos;s sun is very hot in the winter .
So while we were flourishing , my good friend , next to me , said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , why doesn &apos;t nobody invent anything that can run on the skin and then shouldn &apos;t run ? &quot; &quot; I sat there and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God . I &apos;d buy this . &quot; &quot; I went home and did a little research , and I found some very shocking data .
More than 2.5 billion people in the world today have no good access to water and sanitation .
450 million of them live in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
In this environment , there are all sorts of diseases , where the teacher is called the Garden .
A grain is an infection of the eye because of a black-and-eye disk , a number of nuclear infections can blind you forever .
The disease makes eight million people blind every year , and the most shocking part of that is that in order to prevent nuclear pollution you just have to wash faces : no drugs , no pills , no injections .
So after seeing these shocking data , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Even if not for myself , because I don &apos;t have to get around , I have to at least try to do this to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my wonderful working horse , my mobile phone is wearing 6234 — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , and not a lot of Internet , except for the 20 Rand a half hours — I did a piece of paperwork , I did a classes on Google .
And it looked like the special sauce of Kentucky Freud Chicken , right ?
So I had a ready formula .
And now we have to make it practical .
Fast forward four years , after writing a 40-page business plan on the mobile phone , and also my patent on the mobile phone , I have the youngest patent in the country , and — &quot; &quot; Dream running ! &quot; &quot; — I can &apos;t add anything to that . ( Laughter ) I invented Drabling , which is called the world &apos;s first runaway trade .
You just put it on the skin , and you don &apos;t have to run .
( Laughter ) After trying to do it at high school with my limited resources then , I went to university , met with some people , I made it practical , and today we have a completely functional product , which is ready to go into the market . It &apos;s already available in the market .
We &apos;ve learned some lessons in the commercial area and how to offer Drave .
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in large quantities .
They buy products by demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a cigarette box , but a single cigarette every day , even if it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged Drabling in these novel sketches .
They just break them in half , and they trade .
And what &apos;s nice is , one bag is a replacement for a shower in five Rand .
After creating this model , we learned a lot more about using the product .
We also realized that rich kids from suburbia want Dravage . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average , every time they don &apos;t get it , and we also save two hours a day in children in rural areas , which are two hours more in school , two hours more homework , two hours more just being kids .
After we saw the global impact , we took this to the central value of our business plan , which is a cleaner and a convenience .
For the rich , Drave Beach is convenient and poor — saving lives .
After we put the product into work , we &apos;re actually willing to sell the product in a multinational organization to get into the retail market , and the only question I have today for the audience is , in the backways of leapfrogging , with the half-Rand per week , I invented for the world a method of how to not bathe .
What &apos;s driving you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
Another key thing I learned a lot about during this whole process , a year ago Google recognized me as one of the most brilliant young minds in the world .
Today I &apos;m also the best student in the world , the first African to get this aura , and what really amazes me is , I did all this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .

Five years ago I was in a sabbatical , and I went back to medical school where I learned .
I got real patients and I wore the white coat for the first 17 years , actually , since I became a management consultant .
There were two things that surprised me in the month that I stayed there .
The first was that the dominant trend in our discussions was around hospital budgets and killing costs , and the second one , and it really troubled me , was some of my colleagues , who I met , former medical school friends , who I met as some of the smartest people , the motivational members , the most motivated and passionate people I knew about , many of them became hunter-gatherers , fascinated , or killed themselves by the hospitals themselves .
So when we focus on cutting costs , I asked myself , do we forget the patients ?
Many countries you represent , and also the one that I come from , are struggling with health care costs .
It &apos;s a big component in the national budgets .
And many reforms are trying to stop the tumor in them .
In some countries , we have extensive nutrients of patients , surgery .
Other countries don &apos;t have coverage on new drugs , so they don &apos;t reach the patients .
In some countries , doctors and nurses are the culprits , to some extent , in the eyes of government .
After all , the expensive decisions in health care are accepted by doctors and nurses .
You &apos;re the ones who choose to do a expensive lab test , you &apos;re the ones who choose to analyze some old , fragile patient .
So having the freedom of doctor &apos;s action is a way to keep low costs .
And ultimately , there are doctors who will say today that they don &apos;t have full freedom to make decisions that their eyes match their patients .
So it &apos;s no wonder that some of my colleagues are already frustrated .
In Boston advisory group we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , it might not be the right way to manage healthcare .
So we went back and said , &quot; What is the thing we &apos;re trying to achieve ? &quot;
Ultimately , in the healthcare system , our goal to improve health for patients , and we have to do it with limited or affordable cost .
We call it value-based health care .
On the screen behind me you see what I mean by value : results that are considered in patients compared to the money we spend .
This is an incredibly described in a 2006 book by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Tesberg .
In this picture , you see the warmth , and around it the three beautiful daughters .
When we started our research at Boston advisory group , we decided not to deal with costs , but to look at the quality , and in the study , one of the things that fascinated us was the differences we saw .
If you compare hospitals in some country , you &apos;ll find some of them are really good , but you &apos;ll also find a lot of bad hospitals .
The differences were dramatic .
Eric , warm , suffered from prostate cancer , and we probably needed surgery .
Because it lives today in Europe , it can travel to Germany that has good reputation health services .
If he goes there and goes into the average hospital , his chances of losing his maintenance is about 50 percent , and he &apos;ll have to start wearing a cat again .
That &apos;s a coin chart . 50 percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
Instead , if you decide to go to the execution , to a clinic called Martine Clinic , the risk will only be one in 20 .
The choice is either dropping a coin , or a one-to-20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven times bigger difference .
When we look at many hospitals about many diseases , we find these huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know that . We don &apos;t have the data .
And often , the data doesn &apos;t exist at all .
Nobody knows .
So choice in a hospital is the lottery .
It doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There &apos;s hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there was a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons that came into their annual meeting , and they discussed the different audiences where they analyzed the hip chapter .
On the left-hand side of this slide you see a variety of pieces of metal , artificial joints used for people who needed a new hip chapter .
They perceived that they all use different analytics .
Everybody argued , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them knew for sure , and everyone was in India .
So they said , &quot; &quot; Probably we should measure the quality so that we know what and we can learn from the best . &quot; &quot; And they actually spent two years arguing , &quot; What is quality in the development of the hip chapter ? &quot;
&quot; We have to measure this thing , &quot; No , we have to measure that thing . &quot;
And eventually they ended up consent .
And once they agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
They soon found out that if you put a needle in the patient , before you put the metal pole in , it actually lasts a longer period of time , and most patients will never need repetitive analysis in the rest of their lives .
They published the data , and it really changed the face of medical care in the country .
Everybody saw it had a lot of taste .
Since then , they &apos;ve been publishing every year .
One year they publish their league chart : Who &apos;s the best ? Who &apos;s at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to get smarter , so it &apos;s a constant cycle of improvement .
For many years , the Swedish hip surgeon has achieved the best results in the world , at least for those who have measured performance , and the performance of many have not been measured .
To me , this principle is really exciting .
The doctors gather , they agree with each other what quality is , and start valuing performance , sharing the data , finding who is best and learning from it .
A constant improvement .
And that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
It &apos;s exciting in itself .
But if you go back and add the cost aspect of the equation , and you look at it , it turns out that those who focused on quality , their children were actually the lowest costs , even though that wasn &apos;t their goal in the first place .
So if we take the hip analysis story again , a few years ago there was a study where the United States and Sweden were conducted .
In a study , some patients needed regenerative surgery in seven years since the first surgery .
In the United States , that number was three times higher than Sweden .
I mean , a lot of different surgeries , and so much suffering from more to all the patients who have been analyzed in those seven years .
You also understand how saving it could be in society .
We did a study where we looked at the organization &apos;s organization &apos;s data for economic cooperation and development .
The ECD will occasionally test the quality of health care for the first time to get the state data in it .
In the United States , in many diseases , in fact , the quality is below the average of the ECD .
If the American healthcare system is going to focus more on quality measures , and increase quality , even just to the average level of the ECD , it will save the American people 500 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , the national health budget .
You might say these numbers are fantastic , and it makes sense , but is it possible ?
It would be a paradigm shift in health care , and I would argue that not only is it affordable , but it &apos;s committed to doing .
The transformative models are doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
In my work as a consultant , I meet maybe a hundred , or more than 100 doctors , nurses and other medical staff from the healthcare system every year .
And one thing that everybody has in common is that they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
Doctors , like most of you here in the audience , are very competitive .
They were always the best in the class .
We &apos;ve always been the best in the class .
And if someone can show them that the results of what they do with their patients are not better than others , they will do everything to improve .
But most of them have no idea .
But doctors characterize something else .
They &apos;re hard symbols for acknowledging their peers .
If one cardiologist is referring to another cardiologist , in a hospital competing , and they &apos;re discussing why the other hospital gets much better outcomes , they &apos;ll share information .
They will share information that will help achieve improvement .
So , by measuring and creating transparency , you create a cycle of sustainable improvement , and that &apos;s what this slide shows .
You might say it &apos;s a nice idea , but it &apos;s not just an idea .
It &apos;s happening in reality .
We create a global community , a wide global community , where we can appreciate and compare what we achieve .
Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter from Harvard Business School , and the Carolinska Institute in Sweden , the Boston advisory group set up something called Aichum .
It may sound like a hammer to you , but it &apos;s not a hammer , it &apos;s an acronym .
&quot; &quot; international partnership to assess health outcomes . &quot; &quot; international partnership to assess health outcomes .
We bring in senior doctors together with patients , and discussions , disease after disease , in issue what is really quality , what we need to measure , and work to make these global actors .
They worked — four working groups worked over the last year : cataracts , back pain , kidney heart disease , which is , for example , heart attacks , and prostate cancer .
The four groups will publish their data in November , this year .
This will be the first time we compare apples to apples , and not only in the same country , but between states .
Next year we plan to go through eight diseases , next year — 16 .
In three years , we plan to cover 40 percent of the cost of disease .
Control apple to apple . Who &apos;s better ?
Why ?
Five months ago , I ran a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : &quot; I want to run my big institution much more on a quality basis , on outcomes that matter to patients . &quot;
At some point , we sat in a workshop , along with doctors , nurses and other staff people , and we discussed blood videos with children .
The group answered the question , how do we value quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do now ?
We talked about how to treat these kids , what are the important improvements ?
And we also discussed costs in terms of these patients , can we treat more effectively ?
There was a great energy hall .
There were so many ideas , so enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department stood up .
Look around the group and said — first he picked up his hand , I forgot it — he picked up his hand , grabbed his fist , and he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
&quot; &quot; Thank you . Today we are finally discussing what this hospital is doing right . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in the health care system , not just financial value , but results that are important to patients , we will transform the staff of hospitals and elsewhere in the health care system not to the problem , but to an important part of the solution .
I believe that measuring value in the healthcare system will revolutionize , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient in the center , will smile in the grave .
Thank you .

I &apos;m really excited to share with you some findings that really surprised me about what makes companies succeed , which factors actually change the most to success start-ups .
I believe that the startup organization is one of the best forms to make the world a better place .
If you take a group of people with the right financial incentive and organize them to the startup , you release the human potential in a way that has never been possible before .
You make them achieve things that are unbelievable .
But if the startup organization is so great , why are so many of them failing ?
That &apos;s what I wanted to discover .
I &apos;ve expected to find out what actually matters most to the success of start-ups .
And I wanted to try to be systematic about this , avoid some of my instincts and maybe misconceptions that I have of so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
I wanted to know this because I started business since I was 12 years old when I was selling socks at the middle school bus stop , up to high school , when I was making solar power devices , college , when I was making speakers .
And when I got out of college , I started software companies .
And 20 years ago , I started Isaav , and in the last 20 years , we started over 100 companies , many successful companies , and many big failures .
We learned a lot of these failures .
So I tried to look across what factors most affect companies &apos; successes and failures .
So I looked at these five .
First , the idea .
I used to think the idea was everything .
I called my girlfriend Idev because of how I appreciate the &quot; &quot; Aha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you get the idea first .
But then over time , I started thinking that maybe the team , the performance , the adaptability , were even more significant than the idea .
I never thought I would quote the Theresa Mike Tayson at the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , until they get mad in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well .
So much about doing the team is being able to adapt to get authority inside by the client .
The customer is the real reality .
And so I thought the team might have been the most important thing .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does a society have a clear path to make a profit from the customers ?
It started coming up thinking about what might really matter the most to success .
So I looked at funding .
Sometimes companies get large amounts of funding .
Is that the most important thing ?
And then of course , the timing .
Is the idea too early and the world not ready for that ?
Is it early , which means , you &apos;re ahead and you have to educate the world ?
So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies .
And I was looking across every 100 IDLA companies , and 100 non-Idilov companies to try and get into something scientific about it .
So first of all , on these Ivac companies , the five good companies — Stirsch , Karsedic , Guatou , Tenzeiro , Tict.com — all of these became millennials &apos; plates .
And the five companies at the bottom — Z.com , Insider Piege , May Leyoff , Ph.D. , Ph.D. , Phillick — we &apos;ve all had great hopes for them , but they haven &apos;t succeeded .
So I tried to rank across all these characteristics how I felt that these companies were rating on each of these dimensions .
And then for companies that didn &apos;t of Idilov , I looked at wild successes , like Air Bye Ande Bye and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
And a few failures : Webvan , Koszo , Pats.com , Florida and Fundrester .
The companies at the bottom had serious funding , they even had a business model in some cases , but they didn &apos;t .
I tried to look at what factors were actually the most important for success and failure across these companies , and the results really surprised me .
The first thing was timing .
A timing was 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
A team and performance was on the other place , and the idea , the difference in the idea , the distinction of the idea , actually came to the third place .
Now , it &apos;s not entirely defined , it doesn &apos;t mean the idea isn &apos;t important , but it really surprised me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important idea .
Sometimes it changed more than when it was actually timed .
The last two , business and finance model , actually made sense to me .
The company went right at the top of the recession when people really needed more money , and it might help people overcome their resistance for hiring their home to strangers .
Same with Uber .
drivers were looking for more money ; it was very , very important .
Some of the early successes , Stirch , came when people needed pages on the Internet .
Guitzh.com , which we actually announced at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for economic efficient ways to get traffic .
We thought the idea was great , but actually , timing was probably more important .
And then some of our failures .
We started a company called Z.com , it was a entertainment company online .
It was too hard to watch online video content , you had to install cracks in your browser and do all of that , and the company finally spread the leg in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the cracks problem was solved with Edby Flash and the broadband review went 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly timated .
Great idea , but timing is unbelievable .
In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when they started .
The idea matters very much .
But timing matters even more .
And the best way to really value timing is to really understand if consumers are really prepared for what you have to offer them .
Thank you very much . You &apos;ve been a great audience .

I succeeded in school . The expectations of me were high , and in a great awe I walked into the student world of lectures , parties and stealing wires from the side of the road .
Inside me , I was very unhappy , insecure and scared — scared of people , from the future , from failure and from the hurricanes that I felt inside me .
I came out of a talk when it started , reminding myself , engaging with the bag , just as I did hundreds of times before , when I suddenly heard the little voice quietly , &quot; She leaves the room . &quot;
I looked around , and I didn &apos;t see anybody in the environment , but you couldn &apos;t get it wrong with diving and spaceship .
&quot; She opens the door . &quot;
That was the beginning . The voice came .
And it stays , days and then weeks , again and again , describes everything I do in the third body .
&quot; She &apos;s going to lecture . &quot;
He was neutral , emotionally abused and even after a while , I was friends and reassuring in a strange way , even though I noticed that his damaged exoskeleton sometimes falls down and sometimes it reflects an unexpressed feeling of me .
So , for example , if I was angry and I wanted to hide it , something I often did , being very skilled at hiding my real feelings , then the voice would sound frustrated .
From a subtle process of reconstruction , understanding that normal people don &apos;t hear sounds and the fact that I did hear , meant something was very wrong .
I spent a little bit of time telling my college doctor .
And actually , I needed desperate ear to sit down and help . I started telling him about my strange vocal accompanion .
For example , I was involved in a TV channel of students who transmitted new bottles in campus , and during a meeting with him that came together , I said , &quot; &quot; Sorry , but I have to go .
From that point of events were quickly discovered without having control over them .
The hospitality in the hospital , the first of many , then the diagnosis of schizophrenia , and then , the worst , the most toxic and inadequate feeling of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my chances .
But because I was encouraged to look at the voice not as an experience , but as a symptom , my feelings and my opposition to him was overcoming .
But essentially , all of this was a sign of taking an aggressive position towards my soul , a kind of mental civil war , and all of this caused a increase in the number of voices that gradually became more hostile and threatened .
You see the glass of water ?
In fact , there was a cruel cycle of fear , ignorance , mistrust and inunderstanding , and it was a war where I felt helpless and unable to reach peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , the decline was an outlier .
Now I had this full repertoire of crazy : scary voices , distorted visions , and the hallucinations are uncontrolled .
Today , looking back at the despair and the destruction of those years , it seems to me like someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
A broken man and a meal started this journey , but the person who grew out of it was a survivor that would eventually grow up to be the person I was intended to be .
A lot of people hurt me in my life , and everyone I remember , but a desperate male compared to the people who did help me .
I believe that Eleanor will overcome this .
Sometimes , a snow even in May , but at the end of the summer it always comes . &quot; &quot; 14 minutes don &apos;t enough to fully recognize the workers of good and generous people who fought with me and for me and I have been waiting to get my face in the back of that single , moral place .
First it was very difficult to believe it , not very little because the sounds were so hostile and threatened , and so in that aspect , the first vital step was to learn to figure out the metaphorical meaning of what I had before published as truth , simple as ambiguous .
So for example , voices that threatened to attack my home , I learned to publish as an expression of the sense of fear and my insecurity in the world , rather than a real threat .
At first , I would believe them .
For example , I remember staying awake at night next to my parents &apos; room to protect them because of what I thought he was a real threat from the voices .
Like I said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t deal with me .
I have a plastic fork , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I was really strategic .
So , equipped with this knowledge , I finally managed to reconnect my crushed self , when every piece of it was represented by a different voice , I gradually got rid of all my drugs , and I went back to the psychiatry , but this time from the other direction .
Today I am very proud to be part of Introvis , an organization of international movement to hear voices , an initiative born from Professor Maryus Rome and Dr. Sandra , who , regardless of hearing sounds as a survival strategy , in response to unexpected circumstances , not as a normal symptoms of schizophrenia that need to suffer , but as a meaningful experience .
Such a society is not only possible , but it &apos;s already on the way to emerge .
In Praza to Chucose , once social change begins , you can &apos;t get back .
You can &apos;t get a man who feels pride .
You can &apos;t oppress people who aren &apos;t afraid anymore .
In the last 20 years , the movement to hear has deployed support networks to hear voices in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote self-confidence , solidarity and empowering people who suffer from mental distress , to create language and new therapy that will give hope , that bee lies the unstoppable belief in the power of the person .
As Peter Levin once said , the human animal is a special entity that has been focused on the innate capacity to heal and the ability of the instrument to harness this innate capacity .
In this aspect , for the members of the community , there is no respect or greater privilege than pushing forward the healing process for someone , to be witness , to reach out , to share someone &apos;s suffering cough , to cultivate hope for their recovery .
We &apos;re unique . We don &apos;t have a substitute .
What &apos;s in our vicinity is not oppressed , cooked or taken .
Light never turned off .
As one wonderful doctor once told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people told you about you .
Tell me about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photographs .
But is this really a photograph ?
Because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t photograph with a camera .
And yet , my interest in photography started when I got my first digital camera at 15 .
It mixed with my previous passion for drawing , but it was a little different , because using camera , the process was in design .
And when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you click the trigger .
So for me it felt like photography was more about being in the right time in the right place .
I felt like everyone could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process begins when you click the trigger .
Pictures like this : construction taking place along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And yet , it keeps a level of realistic .
Or images like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of keeping a level of realistic .
And when I say realistic , I mean a topographic reality .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually photograph , but I always want it to look like you could take a picture of it somehow as a picture .
Pictures where you need a moment to think to understand the trick .
So it &apos;s more about perception of the idea than perceiving a moment in reality .
But what is the trick that makes it look real ?
Is it something in detail or colors ?
Is it something in light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes perspective is the illusion .
But ultimately , it gets to how to interpret the world and how you can make it on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what &apos;s real , it &apos;s what we think really realistic looks like .
So I think the foundation is pretty simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different parts of reality and connect them to create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three completely imaginary bodies , something that we can all understand when we live in a three-dimensional world .
But when you combine them in a way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , as if it can exist .
But at the same time , we know it &apos;s not .
So we control our brain , because our brains just don &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
And I see the same process with a combination of images .
It &apos;s just really a combination of different realities .
So the things that make the picture look real , I think that &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in life .
But in combination with images , it &apos;s really important to consider , because otherwise it just seems wrong somehow .
So I &apos;d like to say there are three simple rules to fill in order to achieve a real result .
As you can see , these pictures are not really special .
But integrated , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that integrated images have to be the same perspective .
Secondly , integrated images should be the same lighting conditions .
And these two images fill the two conditions — taken from the same height and the same lighting conditions .
The third one is to do this in my home , you can see where every picture begins and ends by the dilemma .
Doing it impossible to say how the image was assembled .
So by coordinating color , contrast and clarity in the boundaries between the different images , adding photographic objects like a field depth , yellow colors and noise , we erase the boundaries between the images and make it look like one image , despite the fact that one image can contain essentially hundreds of layers .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) You might think this is just a picture of a landscape and the lower part is a editing .
But this picture is completely composed of images from different places .
I personally think it &apos;s actually easier to create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas you have in your mind .
But it takes a lot of planning .
And to get this idea in the winter , I knew I had a few months to design it , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was taken on a fishing journey .
The beaches are from somewhere else .
The underwater part was taken in a stone pit .
And yes , I even turned the house in the head of the island to red to make it look more Swedish .
So to get a realistic outcome , I think it comes to design .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
And then it &apos;s to unite the different images .
And this is where every picture is very designed .
And if you do a good job in taking pictures , the outcome can be really beautiful and pretty realistic .
So all the tools are available , and the only thing that constrains us is our imagination .
Thank you .

&#91; In April 3 , we &apos;ve seen the largest data leap in history . &#93; &#91; Panama Panama Papers revealed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; that have hidden enormous amounts of money in accounting outside the country . &#93; &#91; What does all this mean ? &#93; &#91; We named Robert Falmer Falmer from Witness to explain . &#93; This week , there was a whole shadow of stories that came from the leak of 11 million documents from a state-based campaign called Florida .
The release of these documents from chimpanzee puts up the screen on a tiny piece of the secret money world outside the country .
We get a glimpse of how customers and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosques Fonka and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we want a anonymous company , can you arrange us one ? &quot; &quot; So actually you see email , you see the exchange of messages , you see the mechanism of how it works , how it works .
Now , this has already started to make pretty immediate effects .
The Iceland government passed away .
We also have news that the United States of the dictator Syria dictator in the rest of El Ed also has accounts outside the country .
There were the charges of two billion dollars &apos; worth of money leading to the president of Russia and Dimer Putin through his nearest childhood friend , who happens to be a leopard .
And there will be a lot of rich people there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of documents .
Now , it sounds like an elevator from a spy mall or a John Green chart .
It looks very remote from you , from me , from ordinary people .
Why should we be interested in this ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful people are able to keep their money out of the country and not pay taxes they need , it means that there is less money for positive public services like health , education , roads .
And it affects all of us .
Now , to my organization Galville Witness , this exposure was extraordinary .
We have the global media and political leaders talking about how people can use secrets outside the country to hide and compare their assets — something we &apos;ve talked about and shared for a decade .
Now , I think a lot of people find this whole world confusing and disturbing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this kind of world out of the country works .
I like to think of it a little bit like a Russian doll .
So you can have a company within another company , within another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who &apos;s behind these structures .
It can be really hard for law enforcement or tax authorities , for journalists , for civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there was less than a coverage of this issue in the United States .
And that might be because some of the bullying people in the United States just didn &apos;t show up in this exposure , in this scandal .
Now , it &apos;s not because there are no American rich people who bring their assets out of the country .
It &apos;s simply because of the way that assets outside the country work , Mosques Foncka has less American customers .
I think if we saw a leap from Ey Kamen or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see a lot more cases and examples that connect back to Americans .
In fact , in a number of American countries you need less information , you need to provide less information to create a society than you need to get a library card .
This kind of secrecy allowed employees of school districts to parenting school children .
It enabled consumers to be vulnerable investors .
It &apos;s the kind of behavior that affects all of us .
Now , in the Witness Gallery , we wanted to see what it actually looks like in reality .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we sent a researcher in Mosova to 13 law firms in Manhattan .
Our investigator predicted as an African minister who wants to pass suspected amounts to the United States to buy a house , yacht , a jet plane .
Now , what was really surprising was that all of these lawyers except one of us provided our research suggests how to deliver these suspect drugs .
These were initial meetings , and none of these lawyers took us to a client and of course money didn &apos;t change hands , but it really showed the problem with the system .
It &apos;s also important not only to think of it as individuals .
It &apos;s not just about certain lawyers talking to our investigations and provided suggestions .
It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who was caught in the scandal .
It &apos;s about how the system works , which encourages corruption , avoiding tax , poverty and instability .
And to deal with that , we need to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make this kind of behavior harder .
But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are beginning to change .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards transparency when it comes to ownership of companies .
This issue was on the political agenda of the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is going to create major regimes at the national level of who really owns and control companies across Europe .
One of the things that &apos;s sad is that , in fact , the United States is behind .
There &apos;s a partisan legislation shown at the House and the Senate , but it &apos;s not as advanced as we would like to see .
So we really would like to see the Panama leaks , an enormous increase in the world of money outside the country , are used as a way of opening up in the United States and around the world .
For us at the Witness Gallery , it &apos;s a moment of change .
We need ordinary people to get upset about how people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Saudi is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and commitment to change the law to open this kind of secrecy .
Together , we can finally put a secrecy that currently enables tax avoidance , corruption and building money to thrive .
Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
It &apos;s been reported recently that WikiLex , your typical cousin , published — in recent years more documents than all the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
Could it be ?
Julian Assange : Yes , could it be ?
It &apos;s worrying — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is failing so much that a small group of activists can publish more of this kind of information than all the rest of the world &apos;s press combined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people publish the documents ?
And how do you ensure their privacy ?
JA : These are — as much as we know — classic whistleblowers and we have some ways to get the information to us .
So we only use the latest encryption to get information across the network and hide traces we train it in legal values like Sweden and Belgia to regulate legal protection .
We get information in mail , ordinary mail , encrypted or not , testing it like a regular new organization , making it — something that is sometimes quite difficult to do , when we talk about huge databases of information — publishing it in the public and then protecting against the legal and the inevitable political attacks .
CA : So you &apos;re trying to ensure that documents are talent , but in fact you almost never know the same source .
JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . We &apos;re very rarely known ever , and if we discover at some point , then we destroy this information as early as possible .
( Phone diamonds ) Damn .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA that asks what the code for TED companies is . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take the example , actually .
This is something you leaked a few years ago .
If we can get the document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you &apos;ve leaked and what happened ?
JA : So this is a Carol report .
It was a secret intelligence report invited by the government of Kenya after elected in 2004 .
Before 2004 , Kenya was dominated by Daniel Aarp Moi for about 18 years .
He was a hip dictator of Kenya .
And when Kibucky got control — using a coalition of forces trying to clean up Kenya from corruption — they invited this report , they spent about two million pounds on it and a candle report .
And then the government looked at it and used it as a political leverage against Nii , which was the richest man — and still is the richest man — in Kenya .
This is the Holy Grail of the Kenyan press .
So I went there in 2007 , and we were able to put a hand on this just before the election — the national election , on December 28 .
When we published the report , we did it three days after the new president , Kibucky , decided to connect with the man he was going to go further , Daniel Aarp Moi , so this report became a voice around President Kibi &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , in short — rumors the report leaked into Kenya , not from official media , but nonstraightforward , and you think , it changed the outcome of the election actually .
JA : Yeah . He became the headline in the Guardian newspaper and then printed all the neighboring countries in Kenya , in the press in Tanzania and in South Africa .
And so it came from the outside .
And that , after a few days , made the Kenyan press feel confident about his childhood .
And he showed 20 nights in a sequence on Kenyan TV , made a 10-percent increase in voting , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the outcome of the election .
CA : Wow , so your leap fundamentally changed the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : Here — we &apos;re going to show just a little clip from an aerial attack in Baghdad .
The film itself is longer . But here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — strong material , I have to warn you .
Rude : ... just heck , once you get on them you open fire .
I see your factor , oh , I &apos;ve got about four four-wheel vehicles , ah , over ...
You have confirmation . Okay . Jurassic .
Tell me when you hit them . Let &apos;s shoot .
Build everyone .
Come on , fire !
( Cheers ) Keep firing . Keep firing . ( Cheers ) Keep firing .
A hotel ... a Bomshaster , six , Bomshaster , seven .
We need to move , now !
All right , we &apos;ve just caught all eight .
Yes , we see two birds , and we still shoot .
I got them . I have them .
One-six , two-six , we &apos;re in motion .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What happens ?
Damn , Kill . All right , ha . I hit them .
CA : So , what was the effect of this ?
JA : The impact on the people who worked on this was hard .
We eventually sent two people to the clitoris to keep exploring this story .
So this is just the first of three attacks that happened in this scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in this attack , right , including two Royce workers ?
JA : Yeah , two Ruters workers , two young children were injured .
18 to 26 people were killed in total .
CA : And the publication of this has caused a lot to rise .
What was the key ingredient that actually got insurgency , you think ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I guess people can see the inequalities of power .
You &apos;ve got people who go calciously down the street , and then a Apache helicopter sitting a kilometer away from a gay boat developed 30 millimeters on everyone — looking for every excuse to do that — and killing people trying to save a performance .
And there are two engaging journalists who obviously are not rebelled because it &apos;s their full-time job .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s this intelligence man from the United States , Bradley Manning , who was arrested . And the claim is that he echoed in Chat that he leaked the video to you , along with 280,000 visitors classified from the US Embassy .
I mean , did he do that ?
JA : Well , we felt that we got these lightning .
It was accused , five days ago , achieving 150,000 lightning and advertising of 50 .
Now , we published earlier this year from Barack from the US Embassy in Rikyk , but there &apos;s not necessarily a relationship between them .
I mean , I was a familiar visitor in this embassy .
CA : I mean , if you got thousands of diplomatic lightning from the US Embassy ...
JA : We would advertise them . ( CA : Would you ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these are the kinds of things that discover what the real situation is , say , Arab governments . The real impact on human rights in these governments .
If you look at unclassified lightning , that &apos;s the kind of material you &apos;ll find there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little bit broader about this .
I mean , in general , what is your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage a leap of secret information ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a question about what kind of information it &apos;s important for the world , what kind of information that can get reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So the information that organizations spend economic effort contradicting , it &apos;s a really good sign that when the data comes out , there &apos;s hope that it will benefit something , because the organizations that know it best , that know it from all sides , invest effort in order to hide it .
And that &apos;s what we actually found . And these are the press worms .
CA : But is there any risks in this , or the individuals where it &apos;s about or indeed the whole society where the leap can have unintended consequences ?
JA : We didn &apos;t see it from any thing we published .
I mean , we have damage immunity policy .
We have a way to deal with information that is self-diverse — personal information detects within it .
But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your medical records , it &apos;s a legitimate secret , but we deal with the whistleblower that they volunteer and they really have a kind of good motivation .
CA : So they &apos;re good motivators .
And what do you say , for example , you know , to someone &apos;s parents — who built a servant in the U.S. army , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve posted something that someone had an incentive to come up with .
It shows the US soldier laughing at people dying .
It gives the impression — gave the impression to millions of people around the world that the U.S. aliens are inhuman .
In fact , they don &apos;t . My son isn &apos;t . How do you dare ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
JA : Yeah , we get a lot of this kind of reaction .
But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t have to see the video , they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their minds . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who pay for all of this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to shine light to what you see as sort of dark secrets in societies and governments .
Light is good .
But don &apos;t you see irony in the fact that in order to shine that light , you yourself , you have to create subsidies around your sources ?
JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLex Pords yet .
We don &apos;t have sources deployed around other sources .
If they go out , it &apos;s going to be a complicated situation for us , but we probably work in such a way that people feel moral obligation to continue our task , not to push it .
CA : I &apos;d like to know actually , just on the basis of what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious about the opinion in the TED audience .
You know , there might be a number of views about William and Julian .
You know , hero — the People &apos;s hero — brings this important light .
Make dangerous trouble .
Who has the hero figure ?
Who has the figure doing trouble ?
JA : Oh , yeah . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a soft audience , Julian , a soft audience .
We have to embrace more , let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something you haven &apos;t leaked yet , but I think you &apos;ll do it for TED .
I mean it &apos;s a fascinating story that has just happened , right ?
What is it ?
JA : So this is a sample of what we do about every day .
So last year — November last year — there was a series of wooden bombs in Albania like a Bahar explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we got reports — sort of an engineering analysis on what happened — which is , in fact , yeast , from some constitution , these are not oil companies competing , actually smuggled trucks and burst them .
And there was involved in some of the Albania government in that , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing about it , so for us it &apos;s a very difficult document .
We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who was writing it and who knew what it was about .
So we were skeptical that maybe it &apos;s a competitive oil company that &apos;s just trying to use this .
So in these circumstances , we took it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , feels right , but we can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , who wants to go up on the source traces — ( Laughter ) and she says , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to know who the source is . &quot; &quot; So we told them , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What exactly are you talking about ?
Can you show that you have a legal authority about this document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us a screen shot with the name of a friend in the identical details of Microsoft Word .
Yeah .
( Applause ) But it happened quite a few times .
This is one of our methods of identifying — to signal matter , to make these guys write letters .
CA : Yeah . Did you have internal information from BP ?
JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , right now , we &apos;re busy raising major contributions and engineering effort .
So our publishing rate in the last few months has become minimum as we reengineer our systems for the most extraordinary public interest that we have .
This is a problem .
I mean , like all the start-up organization that &apos;s growing , we &apos;re pretty stunned by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting huge amounts of extracurricular revelations that have a very high curve rate , but we don &apos;t have enough people to actually process all this information .
CA : So this is the central bottleneck , particularly volunteer journalists and / or the funding of a salary for journalists ?
JA : Yeah , right , and people you can trust .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization for which it &apos;s hard to grow fast because of the kind of material that we &apos;re dealing with , so we need to rebuild so that we have people to deal with a very high national security material , and then also coherent security cases .
CA : So help us personally understand you and how you got to deal with it .
And I think I read that the child went to 37 different schools .
Could it be true ?
JA : Well , my parents were in the film business and then they were in a mechanical flight , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say it &apos;s a recipe for making paranoia .
JA : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you also — I mean , you were the hacker from a young age and confronted the authorities early on .
JA : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young activist journalist at an early age .
I wrote a journal , put me on a date in Galileo when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with the hacker .
I mean , there &apos;s a species — there &apos;s a method that can be used for all sorts of things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s mostly operated by Russian mafia to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
So this expression isn &apos;t — it &apos;s not as nice as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing somebody &apos;s bank account , but what about your central values ?
Can you give us a sense of them and maybe a event in your life that helped you set them up ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure of an event .
But the key values : Well , generous people , capable don &apos;t form victims , they take victims .
And this is something from my father and something from generous people and other abilities that have touched my life .
CA : Well , generous people don &apos;t form victims , they take victims ?
JA : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a fighter person , so the whole thing of cultivating isn &apos;t really strong for me , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to cultivate victims , which is to monitor crime performers .
And so this is something that was present in my character for a long time .
So tell us very quickly in the last minute , the story : What happened in Iceland ?
You actually published something there , you settled with a bank , and then the news service there got a contraception that was banned on the publication of the story .
Instead , they published your side .
It made you very familiar in Iceland . What happened next ?
JA : Yeah , that was a huge case , you know .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
It has been affected the most difficult way in any country in the world .
Her banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we released this report last July last year .
And the National TV got a publishing arrest five minutes before it came up in the air , like out of a movie , a publishing arrangement came down on the news table , and the Karajan was like , &quot; It never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well we just showed the site in place , all the time , to fill it , and we became very famous in Iceland , we went to Iceland and and talked about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that this shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , with some Icelandic political and other international court experts , we created a new kind of legislation package for Iceland to make it safe for free press , with the most powerful journalist protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for speech freedom .
Iceland is a northern country so , like Norway , it can connect with the system .
And just one month ago , it was passed in the Icelandic Parliament here .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
When you think about the future then , do you think it &apos;s likely to be the Big Brother running much more , more secret control , or are we protecting the Big Brother , or the game is open in any direction ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure which direction it will go .
I mean , there are huge pressures to create harmony in the legislation of speech and legislation about transparency around the world — within the European market , between China and the United States .
Which way would it go ? It &apos;s hard to predict .
So it &apos;s an interesting time to be in , because with a small effort , we might move it in one direction or the other .
CA : Well , I seem to reflect the audience &apos;s opinion to humor , Julian , careful and straight .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel lucky to come from a country that &apos;s usually considered , the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven , women in Iceland who died .
And they didn &apos;t go to work that day whether there were career women or there were homework .
They marched to Rackeyk Center — 90 percent of women participated — and peace and solidarity demanded equality .
Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when there are no women at work .
( Applause ) Five years later , Icelandians received the courage to be the first country in the world who elected democratically , a woman to president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , that president and Gates , as we know her in the private neighborhood , went out to the terrace in her house , if a unit , with her daughter next to her when she won .
( Applause ) This woman was an amazing role model for me and for everyone who grew up at that time , including boys .
She never told , how did a little boy turn to her after having served a few puppets in her role and said , &quot; &quot; Can boys be presidents ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A role model is important , but also having such a powerful role model that I &apos;m so grateful for his existence , when I was encouraged to run into president , my first reaction was , &quot; Who am I going to want to president ? &quot;
Who am I going to be president ? &quot; &quot; Turns out women are less likely to be able to run for president of men .
A study that was done in the United States in 2011 shows that 62 percent of men were thought to serve candidates and only 45 percent of women .
This is a 16 percent gap , and this is the same gap that existed in the last decade .
And this is really a shame , because I &apos;m convinced that the world really needs women leadership and leadership based on principles in general .
So my decision to run away at the end of the day from the fact that I felt that I had to do my part , even if I don &apos;t have political experience , to stand up and try to be part of creating a world that would make sense and sustainable for our children , a world where we really allow to build and our buildings to be whatever they want .
And it was my journey .
And he was amazing .
The journey started with 20 potential meetings .
Takes down to nine candidates , and eventually reduced four running . Three men and I .
( Applause ) But this is not the top of the drama .
You think you have a drama in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can assure you , ours was our own drama in Iceland .
So , our president announced for 20 years at the beginning that he wasn &apos;t going to run what probably led to so many people who were considering running .
And then he changed his mind when our Prime Minister passed away after the famous Panama Panama Panama Papers known for a dress who refused him and his family .
And there was a fellow protest in Iceland , so the president thought the people needed a reliable leader .
A few days later , his wife &apos;s relationships and her family ownership companies also found out in Panama &apos;s orbits , and he removed his mission from the race .
Before retired , he said he did it because now there are two candidates that he felt , could fill his place in office .
So on May 9th , 45 days before the election day it didn &apos;t seem very careful to me .
I didn &apos;t even go into the graphs in the paper .
The polls placed me on one percent and it was still the highest than any woman who had access .
So it would be in bed a little bit to say , I had to work really hard to get to sit at the table of the big ones , and access to television , because the television network decided that only candidates with 2.5 percent and up in surveys would share the first TV .
I discovered in the school of the first TV conflict that I also shared with three other men , and I found in a direct broadcast that I reached exactly 2.5 percent in the first day of conflict .
( Applause ) So , challenges .
The challenges I faced first and first on this journey were with communication , power and money .
Let &apos;s start with communication .
Some say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I can &apos;t say I agree .
To get air time in the media was harder for me .
In fact , the leading candidate appeared in the broadcast media 87 times in the months before election , while I was performing 31 times .
And I &apos;m not saying the media is doing it consciously .
I think it &apos;s mostly unconscious bias , because in communication , just like anywhere else , we have conscious and unconscious bias , and we have to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it .
When I finally got access to television , the first question I asked was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to retire ? &quot; &quot; And that was a tough question .
But of course , with one to 2.5 percent in surveys , maybe that &apos;s understandable .
I was the only one of four candidates that didn &apos;t get an interview on the front page of the paper .
I sometimes remained outside the questions that asked the rest of the candidates and outside the poll of the election .
So I was dealing with this , but I said this , as an Icelandic Ministry .
I got a little bit if I had any comments on my hair and my pants suit .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So they &apos;re all honored .
But there &apos;s another experience , which is very important .
I ran as an independent standing , without a political party or another force supporting me .
This lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably hurt our campaign capabilities , but it also allowed us to innovate and create different politics .
We ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the rule of choices to the rest of the candidates as a result .
It might be why I won at least a screen time , because I wanted to show respect to the rest of the candidates .
When access to media has been so hard , we ran our media .
I made life-improvements on Facebook where I answered it rather than questions of voters in every subject .
We published all the questions I asked and answers I answered on Facebook because we believe transparency is a very important thing if you want to create trust .
And when you want to get to young voters , it &apos;s challenging , I started using Santapchat .
I asked young guys to teach me how to use it , and I used all the filters there during the last period of the campaign .
And I had to use a lot of humor and humility , because I was really bad at it .
But we increased the number of followers in the young people .
So you can run different campaigns as well .
But unfortunately , you can &apos;t talk about politics without mentioning money .
And I think that &apos;s the way , but that &apos;s the truth , we had less financial resources than the other candidates .
Some of it comes from the fact that I had a hard time asking for financial support .
And maybe I had the desire to do more with less .
Some would say it &apos;s very feminine on my side .
But even with a third exposure to communication and a third financial resources , and just an entrepreneurial team , but an amazing team , we were able to surprise everyone in the evening of the election , when the first numbers started coming .
I surprise myself , as you can see in the picture .
( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I was head head with the leading candidate .
( Applause ) Too early , because I couldn &apos;t keep it , but I got to second place , and we did a long way from one percent , with close to one third of the votes , and we won the surveys with unprecedented range , with more than 10 percent of what the last survey was observed .
Some say that &apos;s why I &apos;m the real conductor of the election , and there are many who encouraged me to run again .
But what really fills me with pride is knowing that I had sex with a higher percentage of the young voices , and a lot of people encouraging my daughter to run in 2040 .
( Applause ) She &apos;s 13 years old and never appeared on television before .
And on election day , I watched it again and again on the screen , and she was smart , and self-confident , she was honest , and she supported her mother .
This was probably the peak point of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
These are girls of a duty garden on a trip , who found my poster in a bus stop , and found a passport to kiss it .
Audience : Ooh .
This picture is a doubt triumph for me .
What we see , we can be .
So the hell about fears and challenges .
( Applause ) It &apos;s important that women are dealing with , and it &apos;s time for more women to face key positions , whether it &apos;s for a CEO job , or whether it &apos;s for president .
I &apos;ve even been able to impress your newspaper The New Yorker to get a new degree &quot; &quot; Empoy Live of Testament . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) This may be the most respected degree I &apos;ve ever received , and the reason is that women often get punished when they use what I call , emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become good when we do just that .
( Applause ) And we need more of it .
We celebrated as if we won the night of the election , because that &apos;s exactly how we felt .
So you don &apos;t really have to get the job .
You just have to run to it , and you , your family , your friends , and everyone who works with you , if you do it well , open beyond everything you &apos;ve experienced before .
So we enjoyed , and I learned a lot on this journey , probably more lessons than those I shared here while we had today .
But be sure , it was hard work .
I lost many hours of sleep in those months .
It takes mental resilience and persistence not to retire , but I learned something , that I knew even before that day of the one percent , and that is that we can only be good when we really are authentic and attentive to ourselves and work in the core with it .
As my best sister sometimes says , you can cheat your intuition , but your intuition will never catch you .
I also think that it &apos;s very important , and all of you know this , that in every journey you will find is the team that you take with you .
It &apos;s that there are people around you who share your values and your vision , but different in all other skills .
This is the formula for success for me , and I blessed with an amazing husband , who &apos;s here with me today , in a dead family — ( Applause ) and with wonderful friends and we put together as entrepreneurs in the political country , and we laughed at something that everybody said was impossible .
In fact , the leading marketing man told me before I made a decision that if I get seven percent , it would be great .
I held his angle of vision , because he was probably right , and he said it based on years of experience .
But on the one day I decided to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s important to mention that , because I lost a lot of hours of sleep and worked hard , and so did the people I had .
We can never go to the end if we forget to care for ourselves .
And two things that I think are very important in this context , to surround yourself with people and practices that feed you , and in the same way and perhaps more importantly , to be brave to get rid of people and practices that suck from you energized , including the wonderful and responsive bloggers .
I lost a lot of support from others when I implemented it , and I made a decision to keep pushing as others were separating rhythm , and it allowed me to partly keep energies during the entire journey .
And when I lost energy for a moment — and every time it happened , it wasn &apos;t simple — I always went back to the reason I decided to run , and my choice to run in my way .
I called it the 4G campaign , the GG symbolizes the words in Icelandic .
And the first one is called &quot; &quot; Gagan . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , stand up to your service , and make office leadership at the center of my action and everyone in the campaign .
The second word is &quot; &quot; Glementi &quot; &quot; or happiness .
I decided to enjoy the way .
There were many insights to take from the journey , no matter whether the distance was achieved or not .
And I tried as best I could inspire others to do that too .
The third is &quot; &quot; Gagnswani . &quot; &quot; I was open to every question .
I didn &apos;t keep secrets , and everything was exposed to Facebook and websites .
Because I think if you choose your president , you have a right to get answers .
And last but not least , I don &apos;t have to explain that in this room we ran on the principle of feminine power .
( Applause ) I &apos;m really happy that I had the courage to run , risk loss , but successfully win so many planes .
I can &apos;t say it was easy but I can say , and I think my whole team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not releasing you yet . These are Tomsdor : What a great audience PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying .
That probably everybody in the room is ready to go to Iceland and point to you .
But we probably don &apos;t want to vote there , but one thing we can take from Iceland and and we &apos;ve always been inspired .
I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 1975 when all Icelandic women walked outside , and it was a significant point in liberating women &apos;s movement .
Consider it first . I would love to reinvent the picture and just remind us it was like a whole country stopped a kingdom .
And what you may not know is that American media did not report this , that the Icelandic women were walking again on Monday , right ?
HT : That &apos;s right . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
HT : Yeah , then 41 years after the original strike , we &apos;re probably the best place to be a woman , but our work hasn &apos;t finished .
So on Monday morning at 14 : 38 , women in Iceland left the job , because then they got their daily drunk .
( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men have participated in high numbers than before , because it &apos;s time to close the wage gap .
PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask these people to commit now why she &apos;s going to do next , but means you have a big volunteer army was and decide to run again .
Thank you .
HT : Thank you all .
( Applause )
Why should I pay them equal pay for the same job ?
The second serious epidemic that causes this problem is the disseminated construction of violence , which is increasingly overcoming in the world .
When I was a Georgia teacher , one in every 1,000 Americans was in prison .
Today , 7.3 people from every 1,000 are in prison .
If you do the math , California costs 307 million dollars to send a single person to a red .
One is trustworthiness .
This is a horrible suffering of all the women who live in these countries .
And it was done by her family , so they become murderers when the girl Myota Cleon on the family .
In Atlanta , the world &apos;s deepest airport operates , and the mass passes from the southern hemisphere .
A white leather girl will put in a few times more , and on the average boss in Atlanta , and now in the United States , can earn about 35,000 dollars per capita .
Sex trafficking in Atlanta , Georgia is larger than all drug trafficking .
And this leads to one of the most severe problems , which is that we have more and more women being put into sex slavery in all countries in the world .
About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and no longer prosecuted in which women use less sex , but the owners of the brothels , the servers and the male customers , and — ( Applause ) — the consumer prostitution .
In the United States , we take exactly the opposite position .
For every male who was arrested in a criminal sex garden , there were 25 women in the United States of America .
Canada , Ireland , Sweden I already mentioned , France and other countries are now moving to the Swedish model .
We have two big institutions that we all have : our military and our great universities system .
Now you look at the military some sexual assaults happening .
The last report that I got was signed 26,000 sexual assaults that happened in the military — 26,000 .
You have to change the law .
They &apos;re not prosecuted to trial .
These are the things that are happening in our society .
So we &apos;ve done a certain way , partly , because I &apos;ve been the president and so on — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years there hasn &apos;t been any progress , and the difference has remained 23-24 percent over the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what happens .
This is what &apos;s happening in our country .
Another problem with the United States is that we are the most anti-war nation on the planet .
We &apos;ve been involved in wars with 25 separate countries since World War II .
We had recruitment that fought on the ground .
Or mutant forces that dropped bombs on people .
We have fought against 25 different countries or more , since World War II .
There &apos;s another fundamental factor that I don &apos;t need to mention , which is that in general , men don &apos;t put a spark .
( Applause ) That &apos;s right .
So what is the fundamental thing we need to do today ?
I didn &apos;t even get into details about this .
&quot; What am I going to be ? &quot; I &apos;m not going to code for the sound of your war .
I will not give my soul and not my bones to your end of the war .
I &apos;m not going to code for this golf sound .
I know the rhythm .
It &apos;s lifelong .
I personally know the skin you &apos;re crying .
He would live once , hunt , steal , stretch .
I &apos;m not going to code for your masterpiece war .
I won &apos;t jump , I &apos;ll rotate , or I &apos;ll break for you .
I won &apos;t hate for you or even hate you .
I won &apos;t kill you .
And you certainly don &apos;t die for you .
I &apos;m not going to beat the dead in murder or suicide .
I &apos;m not going to encourage you or dance to bombs because they &apos;re all dancing .
Everybody can get it wrong .
Life is a right , not a mutual or a random one .
I won &apos;t forget where I came from .
I &apos;ll make my drum .
I &apos;ll collect my relatives , and our reserve will be a dance .
Our hum will be our drum .
You won &apos;t play me .
I won &apos;t give my name or my rhythm to your rhythm .
I &apos;m a dancer and an opposition and a dance and a persistence and a dance .
These heart attacks are stronger than warming .
Your war drum is no longer powerful than this breath . Ha .
What does TEDsters sound like ? Let me hear you make some noise .
( Applause ) A bunch of activists .
You &apos;re confused , you want to be a pacifist .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong for a long time .
Very , very much .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
I mean , I said I was preparing .
What that means is I &apos;ve made my clothes . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve made options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming and walking before .
Poetry does it .
She makes you . She makes you intentional .
So I &apos;m going to read a song that &apos;s picked right now .
But I need you to just sit down for about 10 minutes and hold a woman who &apos;s not here now .
Hold it now with you .
You don &apos;t have to say her name , you can just hold her .
Do you hold it ?
This is &quot; &quot; file break . &quot; &quot; All of the sacred history has been banned .
Books that didn &apos;t write predicts the future , predicted the past .
But my head opens around what seems limitless , the violent Caribbean of the human .
Who would that be ?
What male will kill a new day ?
The death of our boys landed .
We cherish labels .
We &apos;re struggling with women , complicated .
The dogs are crying every day .
Republicans become , ignore prophets .
Girls of war and trust are overwhelmed .
All colors flourish , none of us are solid .
Don &apos;t look for a shadow behind me . I carry it inside .
I live in cycles of light and darkness .
The pace is half silent .
I see now , I &apos;ve never been one or the other .
Solly , health , soft violence .
I think now that I &apos;ve never been pure .
A form ago I was a storm , blind , painted — I still am .
The person sliced in the blindness , glue .
I &apos;ve never been pure .
A girl who was destroyed before she was drunk .
Language cannot understand me .
I &apos;m an exponential experience .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses 15 maybe 20 of her family members .
Another woman might have six .
One woman loses her head .
Another woman is looking for the rubble . One woman eats crap .
One woman shot in her face . One woman shot her husband .
One woman calls herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives borders .
One woman no longer believes that love will find her .
One woman never believed .
Where did the refugee hearts go ?
Creates , humiliated , are in a place where they don &apos;t belong , don &apos;t want to be touched .
You face scarcity .
We &apos;re encrypting anybody or we &apos;re not going to mean at all .
My spinal cord is bent with a spiral .
A danger wanted from people and to them .
A cool bombs were left behind .
It &apos;s actually landmines .
Stop rises fire .
You harvest a infected tobacco .
Sharvest bombs .
Sharvest baby teeth .
Sharvest palm , smoke .
Taking up , smoke .
Choice , smoke .
Joshua , smoke .
Gabola , smoke .
His name .
Don &apos;t worry about what has exploded .
If you have to , fear what didn &apos;t blow up .
Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was a student here in Oxford in the &apos; 70s , the future of the world was lousy .
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global hunger was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was about to shorten our lives .
The acid rain fell on the forests .
The desert went one or two miles every year .
The oil was going to run out and nuclear winter was supposed to eradicate all of us .
None of these things happened . ( Laughter ) And amazingly , if you look at what happened in my lifetime period , the average income per capita of the average person in real terms , adjusted for inflation , triple .
Life expectancy grew by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality has gone down by two thirds .
The food production per capita grows in a third .
And all of this while the population has doubled .
How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not .
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that thrives more as its population grows ?
The size of the mountain in this graph represents the size of the population , and the size of the graph describes GDP per capita .
I think in order to answer this question , you have to understand how humans share their mind and allow ideas to fit together and come back and meet and indeed , to mate .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas do sex .
I want you to imagine how we came from producing these objects to make these objects .
These are both real objects .
One is a axe from half a million years ago of the kind done by Homo erectus .
The other one is clearly a computer mouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and the shape amazingly .
I tried to figure out who &apos;s bigger and that &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit in a human hand .
They &apos;re both kinds of technology . Eventually , the imagination among them is not that interesting .
It just tells us that both of them were designed to fit in a human hand .
The differences are what interests me , because the left creates about the same permanent detail for almost a million years — from a million and a half years ago to half a million years ago .
Homo erectus did the same tool for 30,000 generations .
Of course there were some changes , but tools were slowly changing more exclusions in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
And there &apos;s another difference , which is that the object on the left is made of one material .
The object on the right is made out of a mix of materials , silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a mix of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of laser , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;re all using this technology together .
And this is this combination , this sharing technology that I &apos;m interested in , because I think this is the secret to understand what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body is also a combination of ideas , the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
They combined .
How does evolution do collaborative things , accumulate ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
In a sexual species , if you get two different mutations in creatures , one green and one red one , then one has to be better than the other .
One is extinct and the other survives .
But if you have a species of species , then it &apos;s possible to unify the two different mutations .
So what Sex does is it allows the individual to get the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not limited to its ancestry .
So what is the process that has the same impact in cultural development as sex has on biological development ?
And I believe the answer is exchange , the leg of replacing one thing in another .
It &apos;s a unique human characteristic .
No other animal does that .
You can teach them in the lab to do a little bit of exchange , and indeed there &apos;s interaction between other animals , but replacement of one object in another never happens .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No one has ever seen a dog making a very protective replacement of an object with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s possible to have a culture without exchange .
You can have , an asexual culture .
Chimpanzees , pine whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
They teach each other traditions transmitted in inherited inheritance from offspring .
In this case , chimpanzees teach each other how to crack nuts with stones .
But the difference is that these cultures never occur , don &apos;t grow , never accumulate , don &apos;t become collaborative . And the reason is that there &apos;s no sex , there &apos;s no exchange of ideas .
Chimpanzees have a different culture in different band .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange increase the standard of life ?
Well , the answer comes from David Ricardo in 1817 .
And here &apos;s the stone age version of his story , although he told him in the sense of trade between states .
A person takes four hours to make a parking and three hours to make a grain .
A goat needs one hour to make a nerd and two to make a grain .
So it &apos;s a better concentration than humans in both parks and in axes .
He doesn &apos;t need a person .
He can do his axes and his spears .
Well no , because if you think about it , if a goat makes two spears and a person makes two axes , and they make a trading , then each of them will save a time .
And the more they do it , the better it will do , because the more they do it , the better a person is going to get better at doing grains , and the goat will become better at making spears .
So the profits from trade are just going to be enlightened .
And this is one of the beautiful things about commerce , it creates the momentum to specialization , which in turn creates the momentum for more trade and so on .
Adam and goat were both saving an hour of time .
It &apos;s prosperity , the savings at the time required to satisfy your needs .
Ask yourself how long you had to work to provide yourself an hour of reading light tonight to read a book .
If you had to start from scratch , say go to the village .
You find sheep , you kill it , you find the fat from it .
You process it , you make a candle and so on .
How long is it going to take you ? Not a little time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you earn the average wage in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
somewhere in 1950 , you had to work eight seconds in the average wage to get the same amount of light .
And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity you &apos;ve achieved , since 1950 , because it &apos;s seven and a half seconds you could do something else with them , or you could buy a goods or other service .
And somewhere in 1880 , it was 15 minutes required to earn the same amount of light from the average wage .
In 1800 , you had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
In other words , the average person in the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
Let &apos;s go back to this picture of the German and the mouse , and ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Who did them and for who ? &quot; &quot; Grazen Hen was done by someone for him .
He was independent .
We call it poverty these days .
But the object on the right was done for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Dozens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
Because you have to include the man who grew the coffee , cooked for the man on the oil pad , which was a drill for oil , who was going to be a plastics processor , etc .
They all worked for me , making a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how society works .
That &apos;s what we achieved as a species .
Once , if you were rich , you had people who worked for you literally .
So you &apos;ve become rich , you &apos;ve done them .
The 14th Louis had a lot of people who worked for him .
They did his silly costumes for him , like this . ( Laughter ) And they did his silly crashes or whatever .
He had 498 people making his dinner every night .
But a modern tourist spinning Armon Versey and looking at the image of the 14th Louis , he also has 498 people making dinner for him .
They &apos;re in Bittzu , coffee houses and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you in an hour &apos;s warning with a great meal that &apos;s higher quality , probably , the 14th-century ear .
And that &apos;s what we did , because we all work for each other .
We can recline on expertise and trade to increase the standard of life on each other .
Now , there are animals working for each other .
Ants are a classic example , workers work for queens and workshops for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
There &apos;s not one work for the other between colonies .
And the reason for that is that there &apos;s a labor distribution by reproduction .
I mean , they specialize with breeding .
The queen does everything .
In our species , we don &apos;t like to do it .
It &apos;s the only thing we insist on doing ourselves , reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the queen .
( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
And how long does it last ? And what does it mean ?
Well , I think , probably the oldest version of this is probably the sexual distribution of work .
But I don &apos;t have any evidence for that .
It just looked like the first thing we did was to hand the woman for the man and the man for the woman .
In all hunting companies — foragers today have a labor distribution of food search between , in general , male hunters for foragers .
It &apos;s not always that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between dedicated roles between men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s stealing with each side .
The woman knows that in the case of the jellyfish here — that you can dig roots and share with the men in return to meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to the protein is dig some other roots and replace them with flesh .
And she doesn &apos;t have to go hunting and try and kill a pig .
And the man knows that you don &apos;t need to dig in to get roots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a pig , he &apos;s big enough to share a little bit .
And so both sides raise each other &apos;s lifespan through the sexual distribution of work .
When did that happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do it .
They were a very collaborative species .
They were a very smart species .
Their brain , on average , towards the end , was bigger than mine and yours in this room today .
They were creative . They buried the dead they were .
They had a language , apparently , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene from the same kind of thing that was discovered here in Oxford .
And it seemed like they had language skills .
They were brilliant people , I &apos;m not a catalyst in Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence that they had sexual distribution of work .
There is no evidence of women &apos;s infinite behavior .
It seemed like the women were collaborative hunters with the men .
And the other thing that there &apos;s no evidence for is a trail between the groups , because the objects that find in Neanderthal devils , the tools they did , are always made out of local materials .
For example , in Couaz there &apos;s a website that you can find local Neanderthal tools .
They &apos;re always made of local milk stone .
In the same valley , there are modern human remains from the same date , 30,000 thousand years ago , and some of them are local milk stones , but beyond that , many of them are made of volcanic stones from a very far place .
And when humans started moving objects like this , it was evidence that they did a difference between groups .
Trade is 10 times older than agriculture .
People forget this . People think trade is a modern thing .
A exchange between groups has been happening over a hundred thousand years .
And the earliest evidence for this came about 80 to 120,000 years ago in Africa , so you can see volcanic glass and language and other things go from long distances in Ethiopia .
You can also see condoms — as was discovered here by a team from Oxford — moving 125 miles into the Mediterranean continent in Algerian .
And that &apos;s vision that people started to change groups .
And that led to specialization .
How do you know that movement to a large distance indicates trade and not about immigration ?
Well , you &apos;re looking at modern collections like Aboriginal Aboriginal , designed for stone gardens in a place called Mount I. , which was used as a quarry that owned a Calaxdon tribe .
They traded them with their neighbors for things like battles of manta rays , and the result was that stone gardens came to vast parts of Australia .
So long distance motion of tools is a sign of trade , not for immigration .
What happens when you cut people out of trade , from being able to replace and specialize ?
And the answer is that not only do you slow down the technological progress , you can turn it back .
An example of this is Tasmania .
When the height of the sea went up and Tasmania became the island 10,000 years ago , the people on it , didn &apos;t just experience slower progress than the people on the continent , they were actually trying to travel .
They gave up the ability to make tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of 4,000 people was just not big enough to preserve the necessary specialty skills to keep the technology they had .
It &apos;s like the people in this room would be sent to desert island .
How many of the things in our pockets could we keep making after 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen in Tyre Duke Pogo — similar island , similar people .
The reason is because Tyre Didal Pugo is separated from South America in a much narrower product , and there have been trade relations over this product for 10,000 years .
The markers were isolated .
Go back to this picture again and ask yourself , not only who did it and who ? But who knew how to do it ?
In the case of the stone axe , the person who created it knew how to do it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
No one . Never mind , no one .
There &apos;s no one on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean that &apos;s pretty serious .
Computer mice president doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to manage society .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because it doesn &apos;t know how to drill oil in order to extract oil to make plastic and so on .
We all know small parts but none of us know the whole .
I &apos;m a quote from a famous article by Leonard Reed , an economist in the &apos; 50s , called &quot; &quot; I , pencil , &quot; &quot; where he wrote about how pencil is present , and how nobody knows how to make a pencil at all , because the people who make it don &apos;t know how to sell graffiti , and they don &apos;t know how to process trees and things like that .
And what we &apos;ve done in human society , with trade and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
In language we can only communicate ideas that we understand each other .
But with technology , we actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
We moved beyond the ability of the human brain to extraordinary learning .
And by the way , this is one of the reasons why I &apos;m not interested in discussing I.Q. , and whether some groups have an IQ higher than others .
It &apos;s totally not belonging .
What matters to society is how well people communicate their ideas , and how good they are in collaboration , not how sophisticated they are .
So we created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just nodes online .
We are the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the exchange of ideas , the meeting and the classification of ideas between them , that causes the advancement of technology , the growth , more and more .
However , bad things happen .
And in the future , as we go forward , we , of course , will try terrible things .
There will be wars , there will be economic crises . There will be natural disasters .
terrible things will happen this century , I &apos;m absolutely certain .
But I &apos;m also sure , because of the connections that people make , and the ability of ideas to meet and mate as never happened , I &apos;m also sure technology will advance , and therefore the standard of life will rise .
Because through the cloud , through shared resources through the bottom-up world that we created , where not only the elevator , but everyone can hold their ideas and make them meet and mate , we certainly accelerate the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

Good afternoon .
My name is Oldus .
I &apos;m a photography artist from Russia .
I started my way six years ago with ironic self-portraits that showed so many stereotypes about nations , gender , and social issues — &#91; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m Russia , I &apos;m selling drugs , guns , porn and children ! &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Woodka — water . I love vodka ! &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) — using photographs as a tool to send messages , &#91; &quot; &quot; &#93; Still , I &apos;m done .
I &apos;m focusing on balance from meaningful messages , aesthetics , beauty , composition , some irony , and stuff .
Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , called desperate romance .
They &apos;re my objects , or drawings from the Permian Eve in England in the mid-19th century .
I took the painting and I gave a new meaning , an obstacle that talks about the issues that surround me in Russia , captured people who are not models but have an interesting story .
This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but in the middle , he hides his dance classes and shares a mask of violence , tries to fit in with the rest of the classroom as a gateway soldier has no personality .
But this kid has goals and dreams but it hides them to be socially acceptable , because being different is not easy , especially in Russia .
The next project interpretation is metaphor .
And this is Nikola , a security guard in one of the guys at St. Petersburg .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; when he quotes the light from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
He hides his sensitivity and his romantic side because in Russia , among men , it &apos;s not a voice to be romantic , but it &apos;s a voice to be surrounded by women and to look like aggressive fuel .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I take a painting and give it a new and new meaning .
Sometimes , I &apos;ll compare facial lines and play with words : irony , iron man , a brave man .
( Laughter ) Through objects , I bring social issues that surround me in Russia into the conversation .
Interestingly interesting facts about marriage in Russia , that most 18,19 girls are already prepared and dreamed of marry .
We learn from girls , successful marriage means successful life , so most girls kind of fight to find a good husband .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 .
For the Russian company , I &apos;m an elderly and hopeless company to ever marry .
That &apos;s why you see me with a Mexican war mask , in a dark dress , all desperate in my garden .
But remember , irony is the key , and it &apos;s actually to encourage girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and to change the stereotypes .
Be brave , be ironic — it helps .
Be funny and magic .

My name is a colleague .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I came up with this idea of doing something with museums and art in my bossy that &apos;s actually here , and it allowed me to do that .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on demo .
There are many stories about why we did it .
I think my personal story is simply explained in this slide , and it &apos;s an approach .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education — I don &apos;t complain — but I didn &apos;t have access to many of these museums and these artworks .
So when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started studying a lot .
And while working at Google , I &apos;m trying to use this passion and make it more accessible together with technology .
So we set up a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably go into the demo and then tell you some of the interesting things that we &apos;ve had since the launch .
So , quite simply : you can go into GoogleArt.com , Project.com.
You &apos;re looking at all these museums here .
You have the opisical , you have the mum . The harmmingage , the remix , Hyan Gogh .
I &apos;m going to actually show one of my favorites , the Metropolitan in New York .
There are two ways to go — very simple .
Triplets and bang , you &apos;re in the museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
You &apos;re wandering through space , you &apos;re having fun .
Do you want to navigate in a museum ?
Open the map , and in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the hallway .
Keep going . Enjoy .
Check out .
( Applause ) Thank you . I didn &apos;t get to the best part .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m standing in front of one of my favorite paintings , Peter Brugal Butt &apos;s shortcomings .
I see this pulse sign .
If the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
Now this is one of the images .
So that &apos;s all the other data .
For those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on it — but I &apos;m going to close it now .
And this is one of the images we took in what we call the Gappixel technology .
So this picture , for example , has soon , I think , about 10 billion pixels .
And I have a lot of people asking me , &quot; What do you get in 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try to show what you really get in 10 billion pixels .
You can just zoom in .
You see fun things happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is precious .
But then you really want to deepen .
So I started playing with it , and I found something happening here .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; Wait a minute , it sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; I walked in , and I started noticing that actually these kids beat something .
I did some research , I talked to some of my contacts at Matt , and I found that actually it &apos;s a game called Sacole , where Time Avaz is on Thursday before the snack of the snowflake .
And it turns out he was very popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep into it , you can actually get to the pioneers .
And just give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out , so you really see what you get .
Here we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best will come right away — so in a second .
So now let &apos;s quickly jump to Mama , again in New York .
So here &apos;s another one of my favorites , a star coil . Now the example I showed you was about finding detail .
But what if you want to see blue pull ?
And what if you wanted to see how Evan Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
You zoom in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go into one of my favorite areas in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to go into the cracks .
It &apos;s a star coil , I think , never looks like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my second favorite feature .
There are many other things here , but I don &apos;t have time .
That &apos;s the really cool part . It &apos;s called collections .
Every one of you , every one — no matter whether you &apos;re rich , or poor , if you have a poster house — no matter .
You can go in and create a private museum online — create a private collection of all these images .
Simply , you go in — and I created this called the shock force — you can just zoom in to images .
This is the ambassador , which is in the National Gallery .
You can put comments to images , and send to friends and really start a conversation about what you feel when you go through these masterpieces .
So I think , to conclude , for me , the main thing that all these amazing things don &apos;t really come from Google .
They don &apos;t , I think , come from even the museums .
I probably don &apos;t have to say that .
It really comes from the artists .
And it was an experience that filled me with humility here .
I mean , I hope that in the digital medium there &apos;s been justice for their creations and representing them online .
And the biggest question I &apos;m asked these days is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of walking to the museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to add to the experience .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I tell stories .
This is what I do in my life — storyteller , Romanian writer , and today I &apos;d like to tell you some stories about the art of storytelling and also about a legendary creature called Jenny .
But before I get to that , please let me share with you the Russians of my life &apos;s story .
I will do it in the help of words , of course , but also the help of an engineering form , the circle , and so , during my talk , you will encounter some circles .
I was born in Strasburg , France for Turkey parents .
Shortly after that , my parents were separated , and I moved to my mother &apos;s knee .
In the next few years , I grew up as a single girl to a single mother .
In the early &apos; 70s , Bankara , it was a slightly unusual play .
Our neighborhood was full of big family , where fathers were the head of the family , and so I grew up shaking my mother as a fatty in a patriarchal environment .
In fact , in my adolescence , I looked at two types of female .
On the one hand , my mother , a Turkey woman who is educated , secular , modern and Western .
And on the other hand , my grandmother , who treated me and was more spiritual , less educated and certainly less rational .
It was a woman , who read in the background at the bottom of the coffee cup to see the future and melt lead to mysterious forms to defend against the evil eye .
Many people have visited my grandmother , people with difficult instances of buying on their face or having their hands .
Every time my grandmother would take a number of words in Arabic , take a red apple and post it in veins as the number of limitations she wanted to remove .
And then — one by one , she would surround these spines with black ink .
A week later , the patient would go back to a surveillance test .
So , I &apos;m aware that it &apos;s worth not saying things like this in the audience of scholars and scientists , and the truth is , between all these people who have visited my grandmother because of a vicious situation , I &apos;ve never seen anybody coming out of it unsatisfied or uncured .
I asked her how to do it . Was it the prayer force ?
In response , &quot; &quot; Yes , prayer is effective , but in addition , the preservation of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; Which I learned , among other things , one very important lesson : that if you want to destroy something in life , whether it &apos;s a wounded , or a flaw or a human psyche , all you have to do is put it in a thick wall .
What &apos;s inside will dry .
So , we all exist within a kind of social and cultural circle .
That &apos;s how we all are .
We &apos;re born into a family , a nation and a certain dimension .
And even if we don &apos;t have any relationship with the world that &apos;s beyond the world that we take for granted , then we risk being exhausted from the inside .
Our ability to imagine may shrink . Our hearts may wonder , and our humanity may be in front of if there &apos;s too much time inside our cultural brakes .
Our friends , our neighbors , colleagues , family — all the people inside our inner circle are similar to us , that means that we are surrounded by our own reflection .
And another thing that women like my grandmother do in a thread is to cover mirrors in a little bit or complain on the walls when a man is crushed out .
This is an ancient Eastern tradition based on the wisdom that it &apos;s not healthy for humans to spend too much time staring at the reflection of itself .
Ironically , &#91; Live &#93; Organized communities with single perceptions is one of the largest dangers in the global world today .
And this happens everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostalists and believers , rich and poor , East and West as one .
We tend to aggregate groups based on imagination , and then determine stereotypes about other groups of people .
I think one way to transcend these cultural ghettos is through storytelling .
Stories cannot crack boundaries , but they can dig holes in our mental walls .
And through these holes , we can see a faint light of the other , and sometimes even love what we see .
I started writing a story at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a Turkish friend and asked me if I wanted to write a personal journal .
In retrospect , I think she was a little worried about my slides .
I used to tell without finishing stories at home , which was good , except the fact that I used to tell it to my imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
I was an introverted kid to the point where I was talking to my painting colors and apologizing to objects when I came across them , and so my mother thought it was a good thing for me to express my experiences today and feelings .
What disappeared from her is the fact that I thought my life was very boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was write about myself .
Instead , I started writing about other people and things that never happened .
And so , I &apos;ve had this long passion for writing a story .
So at the moment of the beginning , storytelling for me was less an autobiographical expression and more an insignificant journey , to other people &apos;s lives , to other possibilities .
And please , go with me . I &apos;ll draw a circle and go back to the point .
Now , another thing happened at the exact same time .
My mother became a diplomatic .
And so , from my grandmother &apos;s neighborhood , the tiny , tapless beliefs , from the middle class , I suddenly went to an international school that I visited , when I was the only one .
Here it was the first encounter for me with what I call &quot; &quot; representative strangers . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children all over the nation , and yet , this diversity didn &apos;t necessarily lead to a quantitative , cosmopolitical and equitable democracy .
Instead , it &apos;s an aerial dream where every child is perceived , not as a single individual of its kind , but a representation of something bigger .
We were like the U.N. miniatura , which was fun , except when something negative happened to nation or religion .
The child who represented these countries was put to snow , had a bad ratio and finally laughing .
And I &apos;m supposed to know that , because at the time that I signed up to school , military emitters were done by my country , a 200-year-old female almost murdered the episode , and her lap got zero points in the arsenal competition .
( Laughter ) I was born from many lessons and dreamed of becoming a seafarer at the time .
At the same time I was also first tasting the stereotype taste .
The other kids asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Express Express , &quot; &quot; which I didn &apos;t see . They would study how many cigarettes I smoke a day , because they thought all of the editors were heavy smokers , and they wondered what age I would have to cover my hair .
I came to realize that these were the three stereotypes that are focused on my country , politics , cigarettes and hunger .
After Spain we moved to Jordan , Germany and again to Encra .
Wherever I went , I felt my imagination was the only suitcase I could carry with me .
Stories helped me feel the way , the continuity and the consistency , those are the three C that would otherwise be missing to me .
In the mid- &apos; 20s , I moved to Istanbul , the city that I admired .
I lived in a closed , diverse neighborhood where I wrote some of my books .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake happened in 1999 .
When I escaped the building at 3 a.m. , I saw something that drove me in my place .
There was a grocery store there — an old man and a forger who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t talk to the margins .
Sitting next to the side of a transistor with a black , long , long boat moving down her life .
I saw this man opening a cigarette in the hands shaking and offering her one , and this is the image of the earthquake Rider as I see it today — a conservative nominee and a transistor in a smoking pot on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and destruction today between humans evaporate , and we all become one even if only two hours .
But I always believed that stories have a similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not suggesting that the story has the power of an earthquake , and in this room , when we read a good book , we take the little , warm apartment behind , and go into the night alone and start to recognize people we &apos;ve never met and maybe even been biased as their own .
Immediately after that , I went to study women &apos;s college in Boston and then in Michigan .
I &apos;ve experienced a change that isn &apos;t necessarily geographic change like it was a linguistic change .
I started writing a English story .
I &apos;m not an immigrant , a refugee or a pill . They asked me why I was doing this , but the replacement between languages gave me the possibility of recreating myself .
I like to write in a thread , which I think is very foolish and very emotional , and I like to write in English , which for me is very mathematical and related to the brain .
And therefore , I feel that I &apos;m connected to any language differently .
For me , as well as millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
When you learn a new language at the age of late , what happens is you &apos;re in a constant and permanent sense of frustration .
As adults , we want to say more , you know , tell a better joke , say better things , but we find ourselves saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
And this gap is very threatening .
But if we extract courage not to be afraid of it , it also has something horrifying about it .
And that &apos;s what I found in Boston — that frustration was very devastating .
At this point , my grandmother , who kept me all the way of my life in a increasingly growing concern , started adding her daily prayers to wait because I would marry urgency so that I could build one and always .
And because God likes it , I did get married .
( Laughter ) But instead of building , I moved to Arizona .
And because my husband in Istanbul , I started on permanent travel between Arizona and Istanbul , the two places on Earth that cannot be different from each other .
I think part of me has been forever , physically and spiritual .
The stories were shooting me , keeping my part and my memories together , like there was an existential glue .
However , although I love very many stories , recently , I also started to think that they &apos;re losing maximum if and when the story gets caught more than a story .
And this is a topic I &apos;d like to think about together with you .
When my first novel in English came out in America , I heard an interesting comment from a literary critic .
&quot; I loved the book , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; But I would love you to write it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at the book . It has so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters , but there &apos;s only one Turkey figure and it &apos;s a man . &quot; If so , the story takes place in a university campus in Boston , and therefore , for me it was normal to have more international characters in it in relation to complex characters , but I realized what my refrigerator was trying to find .
And I also realized that I would continue to disappoint him .
He expected to find a photograph of my identity .
He expected to find a woman in the book because I found myself that way .
We talk often about how stories can change the world , but we have to look at how the world of identification is affecting how stories are distributed , read and controlled .
Many friends feel the pressure , but friends who are not Western feel it even more .
If you &apos;re an author of the Muslim world , like me , you &apos;re expected to write the stories of Muslim and voluntary women , the sad stories of immoral women .
You &apos;re expected to write stories that are informative , special and typical and leave the experience and the evangelical for the Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child at the Madrid is happening in the literature world today .
Sufers are not perceived as creative people in their own right , but as representatives of the cultures that come from , some friends from China , some of the Turkey , some Nigeria .
We all expect to have something very different , if not weird .
The author and the journeyman , James Boldwin , gave an interview in 1984 where he kept asking about his homosexuality again .
When the interviewer tried to categorize it as a gay writer , Boldin quit and said , &quot; &quot; But you don &apos;t see ? There &apos;s nothing in it that no other person has , and there &apos;s nothing in every other person who has no inside me . &quot; &quot; When the rights politicians try to tag us in the fish , the possible danger is to freedom of our imagination .
There &apos;s a circulated category called multicultural literature where all the members outside the Western world are all spinning together .
I &apos;ll never forget my first reading , at Harvard , about 10 years ago .
We were three authors , one of the Philippines , one from Turkey and one of Indonesia — like a start of a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason they brought us together is not because we were partners in an artistic style or a literary taste .
It was just because of our passions .
Many cultural authors are expected to tell their true stories , and not necessarily the imaginary .
The fact is informed as an invention .
In this way , it &apos;s not only that the authors themselves , but even their findings are perceived as representations of something larger .
But I should immediately add that this trend to see the story more than a story does not just come from the West .
It comes from everywhere .
And I experienced this firsthand when I was on trial in 2005 due to words that said figures in the scisssors .
I mean , I meant writing a constructed novel and writing about a German family and an editorial through a woman &apos;s eyes .
The little story became a big deal when I was on trial .
Some criticized me , others criticized me about writing about the archaeological conflict .
But there were cases that I wanted to remind the two sides that this was a debate .
It was just a story .
And when I say &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to underestimate my work .
I want to love and celebrate the story for what it is , not as a means of achieving purpose .
Surors deserve to be political positions , and there are very good political affairs in the market , but the language of the story is not a language of ectonic politics .
Chov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to the problem and the right way to formulate the question are two completely separated things .
And only the second of the two is the responsibility of the artist . &quot; &quot; The identity politicians separate us . The story connects .
One is interested in absolute rules .
The other one , the differences are right .
One draws boundaries .
The other one recognizes the absence of the border .
The identity politicians are made out of solid rectangles .
Story is water that is affected .
At the time of Jomani , there were nomadic storytellers called &quot; Made , &quot; &quot; they used to go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story to the audience of the residents , sometimes improvising .
With adding more figure to the story , the sympathy changes the voice , mimic the same character .
Everyone was invited to come and listen , you know , ordinary people , even the Sultan , Muslims and who are not Muslim .
The stories were crossing through all borders , like &quot; &quot; Joshua stories , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
Today , stories continue to rise above borders .
When Palestinian politicians talk , they don &apos;t usually listen to each other , but , Palestinian readers still read Romans of Jewish friends , and so on the other , connect and discover empathy to the telling character .
On the literature to carry us beyond .
If it can &apos;t take us there , it &apos;s not a good literature .
Books saved the introverted and shy child , which I used to be .
But at the same time , I &apos;m aware of the danger of their blind love .
When the author and the mystic , Romi , met his spiritual colleague , Amos Theresez , one of the things that the last one did was turn Romi &apos;s books into water and look at the morphed letters .
The monkeys say , &quot; &quot; The knowledge that doesn &apos;t take you beyond dangerous yourself is even more ignorant . &quot; &quot; The problem in the cultural ghettos that we have today is not inknowledge . We know a lot about each other , or at least we think , but knowledge that doesn &apos;t take us beyond ourselves , makes us optimistic , distant and distant .
There &apos;s a metaphor I love : living like a celebration .
As you know , one foot of the lagoon is rooted in place , static in place .
And at the same time , the other leg draws a big circle , moves without the bar .
And so is my story .
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul with powerful Turkish roots , but another part of it migrates in the world , connects to different cultures .
In this sense , I like to think about my stories both as catalysts and as universally , stories that are &quot; &quot; away , &quot; &quot; but also everywhere .
Those of you who used to be in Istanbul and probably saw Armon Tokafi , which was a seminal place of the Gomani Sultans , for over 400 years .
In the palace , right outside the residential zone of the most favorite meetings , there &apos;s an area called the Johnny meeting place .
An area between buildings .
I &apos;m fascinated with this idea .
We &apos;re usually suspicious about these areas that fall between categories .
We see them part of the supernatural area , just like the Jenny , made of a smooth fire and symbolizes the element .
But my point is , perhaps , that deep region is what writers and artists need more than anything .
When I write a story , I cultivate the elusive and the ability to change .
I like not to know what &apos;s going to happen in 10 pages .
I love when my characters surprise me .
There &apos;s a possibility that I &apos;ll write about a Muslim woman in one story , and it might be a happy story , and in the next book , I can write about Professor Guinea and Homo in Norway .
As long as it comes from our heart , we can write about everything .
Odar Lord once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &quot; &quot; I think , therefore I am . &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s a great shift in mindset .
And yet , why is it that in the course of creative writing today , the first thing we teach students is to write about what they know .
Maybe it &apos;s not the right way to start .
Deminary literature is not necessarily a writing about what we know and what we know or about our identity .
We need to teach young people , and so do we extend our hearts and write about what we feel .
We need to go out of our cultural wheat and visit the trust to him and the one after him .
Ultimately , stories move like skyscrapers , draw circles inside circles .
They connect all humanity , regardless of the politics of identities , and that &apos;s the good news .
And I &apos;d like to end with an ancient finite song . &quot; &quot; Come , let &apos;s go , make a difference ; let &apos;s make our lives simplified ; let &apos;s make love and love ; the ground will give up to anyone . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m Jane McGuingel . I &apos;m a game designer .
We do achieve more in game worlds .
So , up to this point , all the gamers at Worldchanging Warcraft together have invested 5.93 million years in solving the virtual problems of zones .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
We develop into a more collaborative species and in me .
And as a result , social bonds are actually more powerful .
Five million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
His work is brilliant . He &apos;s looking at why .
But it &apos;s not , in any way , an optimal situation .
We need to make the real world more like play .
Before we had great joysticks , we had honey joints .
People were suffering . People were getting it .
It &apos;s really exciting .
According to the Rodortus , then King decided to play one final cube game .
We want to imagine a pair of wins , and then give people the tools to achieve the European winning .
We created this game in 2007 .
It &apos;s a story and an amazing journey that you can participate in .
We have a graphic chart . We have to rise levels in properties like local insight , knowledge networking , survival , vision and resourcefulness .
A dirty work team and I came to a small town in Colorado , called Craig .
It &apos;s small — just a few square kilometers ; it &apos;s in the Rocky Mountains .
The spoken work was sheep farmer .
My role in the program — for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — is quite simple .
I &apos;m an expert , and I work with people who really do the spoken work .
I &apos;m just supposed to try and keep up and report yes about what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day of their lives .
Working in the program this time ... sheep spelling . Great .
We went to Craig and got into the hotel and the next day I realize that Cyrus is going to be in the middle of this work .
Now , usually , I never do foregone research .
But , this is a sensitive subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to show everything we do in a great way , and we certainly want to do it by making a lot of respect to live .
So I called HUMANE SOCITY and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to run some phone calls , can you explain to me how this works ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s pretty simple . &quot; &quot; They use Google — in fact , a rubber body , like this is just a little bit smaller .
It was actually around the cards package I got yesterday , but it &apos;s because of what I know .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the procedure exactly ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You put the body into the tail , intrinsically .
And then another gorilla is suspended to the bag of darkness , intrinsically .
The blood flow slows down to slow down , and a week later the spoken parts fall .
&quot; Great ! I got it ! &quot;
Okay , I call the animal youth Association , to make sure that — and they associate that .
I also called PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it , but they confirm it .
Okay , so that &apos;s actually the way you have to do it .
So the next day I come out .
I get a horse and we go out and get the feces and we take them to a clinic that we built , and we start doing live interface management .
Melini is Albert &apos;s wife .
Albert is the focus of the speaker .
Melini lifts the wonders — two hands — one hand holds the right legs , and the left legs .
The toss comes up on the page , it opens it .
Okay , great .
Albert comes in , I join Albert , the team around us .
I always look at the process done once , before I try it .
As a specialist , you know , this is how you do .
Albert Royn to pull out of the pocket , you know , black gomery but what comes out of the place is a knife .
And I &apos;m like , knife is really unGuimee , you know .
And he was like this , opened it in a way that caught the sun that just came up above the Rocky Hillary , and it was very — it was — it was very impressive .
And within two seconds of the value , Albert held a knife between the bandwidth of the tail , right next to the power of the toss , and very quickly , the tail was no longer there , and suddenly found in the bucket that I held .
A second later with a big thumb and a finite finger , he held the dark bag , strongly .
And he pulled it in his direction , like this , and he took the knife and he put it on the edge .
Now you think you know what &apos;s going to come , Michael — but you &apos;re not .
Okay , he cuts it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the bag of darkness , pulls it up , and then his head sits down , blogs my field of sight , but what I hear is a kind of sucking sound , and noise that sounds like a Scottish cloth that &apos;s tucked up glue and I &apos;m not kidding .
Can we play the video ?
No — I &apos;m kidding — we &apos;re not — ( Laughter ) I thought it would be the best to speak grammatically .
So , I did something I never did in photographs of the program , never before .
I say , &quot; &quot; Stop time . Stop . &quot; &quot; You probably know the program , we take a picture of it in one scene , we don &apos;t take a shot .
No writing , no script , no nonsense .
We don &apos;t get out , we don &apos;t rehearse , we take a picture of what &apos;s going on !
And I say , &quot; &quot; Stop . It &apos;s crazy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , you know ...
( Laughter ) It &apos;s crazy .
We can &apos;t do that . And Albert says , like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I say , like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened right now , but there are testes in this bucket and it &apos;s not the way we do it . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the way we do it . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even give him an opportunity to explain , I say , UNOME , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying it &apos;s the way .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make them spin and bleed — we &apos;re five-continents , human beings .
We penetrate twice a day in the Discovery channel — we can &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box , and he pulls a bag with little rubber rubber .
Melini cheats another toss , puts it on the page , the gorilla goes on the tail , her body goes on the bag of dark .
The toss goes down to the floor , the toss takes two steps and falls , lifts , shakes a little bit , takes another two steps , again falls .
And I &apos;m like , it &apos;s not a good sign for this battery at all .
It lifts , goes to the corner , shaking , and it &apos;s lying on the floor , in a clear distress to the eye .
And I look at the toss and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
When will it rise again ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Day . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Day ! How long does it take for the angels to fall ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Week . &quot;
Meanwhile , the toss passed the triumph , you know , bouncing around us , the bleeding stopped .
And he &apos;s , you know , making some grass , spinning .
And in that second , I was just amazed how wrong I was , in that second .
And I remembered how completely wrong I am , vast chapters of the time .
( Laughter ) And in particular , I remembered how unfortunate I was that day because now I have to do what Albert did , and there are about 100 patches in the post , and all of a sudden this process starts to form a German porn movie , and I &apos;m like , Mermama Tesla , puts it on the page , opens it up .
Albert is reaching me the knife .
I go in , the tail goes down .
I go in , grab the bag of dark , the tip goes down .
Albert guides me , &quot; &quot; Make it up to the top . &quot; &quot; I do that .
&quot; Make more urgent up . &quot;
I do that .
The dark ones are discovered , they look like thumbs , which are reaching towards you , and he says , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to attract them .
We &apos;ll just pull them out . &quot; &quot; And I hear him , I hear all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how — how did I get here ?
How — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
( Laughter ) This is one of those moments where the brain is turned off by itself and all of a sudden , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rocky Mountains , and all I can think of is the definition of tragedy by Aristotle .
You know , Aristotle said that tragedy is the moment when the hero is present , face to face , to its real identity .
( Laughter ) And I say , like , &quot; &quot; What is this glamorous metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m — I can &apos;t get this thinking out of my head , I can &apos;t put this picture up — I think , so I did what I had to do .
I purchased them and climbed them by my mouth .
I took them like this , and I pulled my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on the chin .
( Laughter ) Now I — I can &apos;t get away from the metaphor .
Okay , I &apos;m still poetic , in Aristotle , and I think — a place has emerged two concepts to my head that I haven &apos;t heard them since the classical school professor put them in there .
And they &apos;re &quot; &quot; Anonymous &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; prayer &quot; &quot; .
&quot; Anonymous &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; privilege &quot; &quot; .
Anonymous is the Greek word for discovery .
Literally , the transition from ignorance to education is Anonymous .
What our network does is what dirty jobs are .
And I &apos;m influenced by Announricians every day .
Great .
The second word , &quot; &quot; privilege , &quot; &quot; is the moment in the great Greek tragedies , you know — iripydides and sopacas — the moment that Edipus has his moment when he suddenly reveals that he &apos;s lying with her and doing children with her is his mother . Okay .
It &apos;s a primate or a primate .
And this metaphor in my head — I have Announcer and Prífuna on the Sentar .
( Laughter ) I have to tell you , it &apos;s a really great trick .
When you start looking for &quot; &quot; Priya &quot; &quot; you find it everywhere .
I mean , Bruce Williams in the movie &quot; &quot; The Sleep Hall , &quot; &quot; right ?
I spend all of the movie trying to help the little boy see dead people , and then , boom — hey , I &apos;m myself dead — Priya .
You know ?
It &apos;s destroyed when the audience sees it in the right way .
Nio , in the movie &quot; &quot; Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
Oh , I live in a computer program — that &apos;s odd .
These discoveries bring to insights , and I &apos;ve had these , over 200 dirty jobs , I &apos;ve got them all the time , but that &apos;s where I got something on my head in a way that I just wasn &apos;t ready for .
And as I stand there , I look at the absurd unemployment that I just picked it up — but it looks OK .
And when I looked at the poor other thing that I was working on in the right way and I was just amazed and thought if I was wrong with it — if I was wrong with it — and if I was wrong often , literally , what other prioritized perceptions could I respond to ?
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist , but I have a friend who is .
And I talked to him .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey , Mike .
I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in things like this or not , but you noticed that you &apos;ve taken every country and country in the United States ?
You worked in a library , you worked in a fishing , you worked in steel , you worked in any big industry .
You &apos;ve worked in your neighbor with all these guys whose politicians are desperate to call them every four years , right ? I still see Hillary shoot with churches and skiing on Santa , near the workers in the steel industry .
I mean , these are the people I work with everyday .
And if you have something to say about their opinions , inclusively , maybe it &apos;s time to think about it .
Because you know , human beings ... four years . You know , it goes through my head , extended on Santi , thoughts jump over here and here .
And after that day , the &quot; &quot; dirty jobs &quot; &quot; program didn &apos;t change much , in terms of what the program itself was , but it changed about , personally .
And now , when I talk about the program , I &apos;m not just telling the story you &apos;ve heard and 190 like him .
I &apos;m telling the story , but I &apos;m starting to talk about some of the other things that I &apos;ve just missed , some of the other conventions about work that I &apos;ve just assumed are sacred , and they &apos;re not .
People with dirty jobs are happier than you thought .
As a group , they are the most happy people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; seeking the working probability tag &quot; &quot; and all of these nonsense of happy employees .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are easy people working in unorchestrated jobs .
The workers who collect animals that are going down on the roads , burning for themselves , I swear . You &apos;ve done it with them .
They have this amazing symmetry in their life .
And I see it over and over again .
So I started thinking , what would happen if we read a challenge about some of these sacred lights ?
Go with your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for 36 hours .
Go with your passion — what could be wrong with this ?
Maybe the worst advice I &apos;ve ever received .
( Laughter ) You know , go with your dreams and spread your leg , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard when I was growing up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do in my life , but I was told that if I went with my passion , it would all come together .
I can give you 30 examples , here and now — Bob Comboss , the pig tower in Las Vegas that collects the rest of the food from our prisons and feed them to his pigs .
Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in what we don &apos;t eat , its pigs grow at twice the rate of age , and it &apos;s what it is , it &apos;s a rich pig tower , and it &apos;s good for the environment , and it &apos;s spending its days in this amazing service and it smells like hell , but the sky will consume it .
It &apos;s a beautiful living .
You ask him , go with your passion here ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;ll laugh at you .
This person &apos;s worth — recently offered him something like 60 million dollars for his farm and he refused , outside Las Vegas .
He didn &apos;t go with his passion .
He took a step back and looked where everybody was going and then went the other way ... you know .
And I hear this story over and over again .
Matt Prand is a whale in New York City , Connecticut , who just took one day and found that the garbage from his fruit was worth more than their milk , if he could exploit it to create biodegradable organic arrows .
Now , he sells them into the Walmart stores .
Go with his passion — the person ... Come on .
So I got interested in passion . I started looking efficiently at effectiveness , as Tim talked before — there &apos;s a very big distinction here .
I started looking at teamwork and decision work , and in fact all the dedicated traditions from the successful successful machines are dependent on the racial art in direct rooms around the world right now .
All of this — everything turned around .
Security ... first safety .
This is — I go back to OSHA and PETA and HUMANE SOCITY . What if OSHA got it wrong ?
I mean , it &apos;s epixies , what I &apos;m going to say , but what if it really is a third safety ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean seriously .
What I &apos;m going to say is that I appreciate my safety in these crazy jobs just as much as the people I work with , but the ones that really do , they &apos;re not the ones that talk about first safety .
They know that there are other things that are going on — the business of doing the previous work , the business of succeeding .
And I &apos;ll never forget — there in the Ring Sea — I was in a crabs ship with the most deadly climbers , which I worked with in the first season .
We were about 150 kilometers off the coast of Russia , giant sea waves , 15 feet high , green water washing the wheel room , right ?
The most dangerous environment I &apos;ve ever seen , and I &apos;m with some guy , associating the barrels to the deck .
So , I &apos;m 12 meters above the deck , which is like looking down on the shoe , you know , and it does this in the middle of the ocean .
It &apos;s dangerous without words .
I run down , I go into the Department of Defense and I say , at a certain level of skepticism , &quot; Rabbi Bell , OSHA . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? — OK .
( Laughter ) But at that moment , what he said later is no longer said in the 48 countries of the United States .
You can &apos;t repeat it in any factory hall or a construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; My son — he &apos;s my age , by the way , and he calls me my son , I love this — he says , &quot; &quot; My son , I &apos;m a cancer survivor .
My responsibility is not to bring you home in life .
In my responsibility to get you home rich . ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , it &apos;s about you .
And to go on that day , previous safety .
I was , like , so , the idea that we &apos;re generating in a false way — kind of a sense of antennae when all we &apos;re doing is talking about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as if it &apos;s ours , and the opposite .
Anyway , a lot of things .
I can talk along the many small diagnoses that we did and the infinite list of ways I was wrong with .
But , in the end , it &apos;s like this .
I &apos;ve come up with a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it with you two minutes and 30 seconds left .
It goes like this — we announced a war on work , as a society , all of us .
This is civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , actually .
We didn &apos;t intend to do that , and we didn &apos;t play with the mustache in some sort of orbital way , but we did it .
And we fought at four fronts at least , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we show people working on TV , it &apos;s worthy of laughter .
If there &apos;s a rabbi , it weighs 150 pounds and it has a stroke in its stomach , thanks .
You see it all the time .
This is what rabbits look like , right ?
We make them heroes , or we make them confident .
That &apos;s what television does .
We use dirty jobs not to do that , and that &apos;s why I do the job , and I &apos;m not cheating .
But , we announced war on Madison Street .
I mean , so many ads coming out of there — in a message , what are we really going to say ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little bit less , if you didn &apos;t have to work that hard , if you could go back home a little bit earlier , if you could go to pension a little bit earlier , if you could pass a ticket at the end of the reserve a little bit earlier , all there , again .
Washington — I can &apos;t even start talking about the transactions and policy that have an impact on reality in the bottom line of parenting jobs , because I really don &apos;t know .
I just know it &apos;s a frontier in this war .
And right here , guys , Silicon Valley , I mean , how many people have an iPhone on them now ?
How many people have their Blackberry ?
We &apos;re networked , we &apos;re connected .
I would not suggest for a moment that something bad came out of the technological revolution .
Come on , not for this audience .
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a total time waste .
And nobody celebrates imitation in a way that dirty work knows you have to be done .
Your iPhone , without those people who make the same interface , the same circuit , the same board , over and over again .
All of this — that &apos;s what makes it possible , equally — like the genius coming in .
So we have a new toolbox , you know .
Our tools today don &apos;t look like ethics and craters .
They look like the things we walk around with .
And then the general effect of all of this is the download of a lot of jobs .
And I realized — too late — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do another 200 of them , but we &apos;ll do as much as we can .
And the most important thing is to know and really meet face to face with the fact that I was wrong with a lot of things , not just the angels on the chin .
I was wrong with a lot of things .
So we think — when I say we , I mean , I mean , the right thing to do is to talk about a PR operation for work , physical work , skilled work .
Somebody has to be out there talking about the common benefits .
I &apos;m talking about the things of grandfather , the things that many of us grew up on , but along the way , you know , we lost a little bit .
( President ) Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a big deal .
For this war , which I guess exists , there are injury like any other war .
The first impact is infrastructure . The decline in prescription to professional schools is the second .
Every year , less electric , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer margins , less margins , less warriors , less heat puffs .
The infrastructure jobs — everybody &apos;s talking about their creation are these guys . Those who were in the driving , over and over again .
Meanwhile , we have two trillion dollars , at least , according to the American Association of engineers , that we need to spend to influence , even a little bit , in infrastructure that are currently representing almost fail .
If I were to play any role , and I &apos;m not going to do that , I would simply say the jobs we hope to find and the jobs we hope to create will not stay if they &apos;re not jobs that people want .
And I know that this conference goal is to celebrate things that are close to us and expensive to us , but I also know that clean and dirty are not the opposite .
They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like novelty and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like Pritua and Anonymous , like this poor toss , which I hope is no longer shaking , and like their time .
It was fun to talk to you now to come back to work , okay ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unleash a billion big ideas that are currently in us .
And my little idea to do that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a room full of women like A. It &apos;s a room .
Of dark women sleep .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Two and a half years ago , I had passed away from happening .
I hit my head at the table , and I broke my lawn bone , I have five seams on my right eye .
And I started a journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
And during that time , I learned , I met with doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way for a more productive life , more inspiring , happier life is to sleep enough .
( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
We &apos;re going to smoke our way to the top , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , men from lack of sleep have become the male symbol .
I recently founded dinner with a guy who volunteered that had only four hours of sleep in the previous night .
And I felt like I wanted to tell him — but I didn &apos;t say — I wanted to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you were five years old , this meal was much more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s now a kind of competitive sleep deprivation .
Mostly here in Washington , if you try to set a breakfast meeting , and you say , &quot; &quot; What do you say about eight ? &quot; They &apos;ll often tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight in the morning it &apos;s late to me , but it &apos;s okay , I can put a tennis game and do some conversations and conference and meet you in eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means they &apos;re so busy and productive decisions , but the truth is that they &apos;re not , because they &apos;re in politics , at the moment .
So high IQ .
It doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is the ability to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
And we had too many glaciers affected our rituals .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Hamen Breddies were the brothers and sisters to the right , they were still with us .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy being connected 24 / 7 , maybe a nurse was in the glacier , because she would wake up from seven and a half hours to eight hours and she would be able to see the big picture .
So when we face the most fragile of the world right now , what is good for us at a personal level , what will bring more happiness , grateful , and effective in our lives and will be best for our career , is also what is best for the world .
So I urge you to close your eyes and discover the big ideas within us , turn off the motors and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
As Chris said , I study the human brain — the functions and structure of the human brain .
I want you to think for a minute what that means .
We have an organ that &apos;s 1.2 kilos of gee that you can hold on the palm of your hand , and it can capture the space of space between planets .
It can conceive of the infinity and it can think of itself as an infinity thinker .
This critical thing is called self-awareness , I think this is the Holy Grail of all neuroscience , and maybe one day , hopefully , we can understand how this happens .
So how do you study this mysterious organ ?
We have about 100 billion nerve cells , little strands of protocell , interact with each other , and this activity creates a huge range of capabilities that we call human consciousness .
How does this happen ?
Well , there are many ways to study the functions of the human brain .
One approach , which is used a lot , is to look at people who have been affected in small areas of the brain , and there have been genetic changes in very small areas of the brain .
What happens then is not a complete imperative of all of your brain capabilities , the abolition of your mental ability .
What happens is a targeted loss of function when all the other functions remain correctly , and that gives us some confidence to assume that this region of the brain is somehow responsible for this function .
And then you can adjust a function to the structure , and figure out what the brain links do to produce this function .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
Let me give you some amazing examples of this .
In fact , I &apos;ll give you three examples , each of six minutes , during this talk .
The first example is a remarkable syndrome called Kaparas syndrome .
If you look at this picture here , here are the temporal lobes , the protective lobes , the primal art , the art that make up the brain .
And here is , hidden in the temporal lobes as you can see here , a structure called the fusiform gyrus .
And this is what scientists call the brain &apos;s face because when it &apos;s damaged , you can &apos;t recognize people &apos;s faces .
You can still recognize them by their voice and say , oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , but you can &apos;t look at the face and identify who it is .
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
You know it &apos;s you , because it &apos;s running when you &apos;re a victim , and you know what it shows , but you can &apos;t really recognize yourself .
All right . This syndrome is known as a result of brain damage to the specialized cat .
But there &apos;s a more rare syndrome , so rare that few doctors know it , even neurologists .
And it &apos;s called the Capgras illusion , and it expresses normal patients in any other way that have brain damage , coming out of a coma , normal from every aspect , but look at their mother and say , &quot; &quot; This woman looks like my mother , but no , she &apos;s predicting .
She &apos;s another woman pretending she &apos;s my mother . &quot; &quot; Why is that happening ?
Notice , this person is diving and intelligent from every aspect , but when he sees his mother , the illusion appears and claims it &apos;s not his mother .
The most common interpretation of this , which you &apos;ll find in all the psychiatric books , is the Freudian interpretation , which is this guy , and you can interpret the same for women , by the way , but we &apos;re going to talk about men right now .
When he was a baby , a very small baby , he had a strong sexual appeal to his mother .
This is what &apos;s called Freud &apos;s Edipus complex .
I &apos;m not saying I believe that , but that &apos;s what Freud said .
And when you grow up , the cortex evolves , and you learn to contain the sexual impulses towards your mother .
Fortunately , you &apos;re not sexually stimulated every time you see your mother .
And what happens is , after brain damage laid in the skin , these hidden sexual impulses go out , go up to the surface , and all of a sudden , you start to be sexually stimulated by your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s my mother , how do I live sexually ?
She &apos;s probably not my mother , she &apos;s predicting . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the only logical interpretation for the damaged brain .
The Freudian interpretation never seemed reasonable to me .
It &apos;s kind of ingenious , like most pro-friendly interpretations — ( Laughter ) but it didn &apos;t make sense because I saw that illusion , which was a patient in relation to his pole . ( Laughter )
He said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , she looks like a pee , but she doesn &apos;t , it &apos;s just another dog . &quot;
You &apos;re going to see using the Freudian interpretation right now .
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the hidden infrastructure in all humans , or something else absurd .
So what &apos;s really going on here ?
So to explain this strange syndrome , we &apos;ll look at the structure and function of the visual system in the brain .
Normally , images come through the eyes , and move to the visual regions of the brain .
There are actually 30 regions in the cortical areas that are only targeted to vision , and after all the processing , the information comes to a small structure , the fusiform gyrus , which catches faces .
There are neurons that are susceptible to faces .
You can call it the inside of the brain , right ?
I talked about it before .
When the area is flawed , you can &apos;t see faces , right ?
But from this region , the data goes into a structure called amygdala , inside the limbic system , the emotional center of the brain , and this structure , called amygdala , decides the emotional importance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it a spouse ?
Or is it something trivial , like a piece of next , or a piece of chalk , or — I don &apos;t want to vote on it — or a shoe , or something like that , right ?
Something that can be completely ignored .
And if the amygdala lives , it &apos;s a sign that &apos;s important , and then the message goes through the autonomous nervous system .
The heart starts to dim faster .
You start sweating to disperse the heat that the body is going to take out of the muscle acts .
And that &apos;s good , because we can put two electrodes on the wrist and measure the changes in the skin &apos;s electrical strip , as a result of the sweat .
So I can check , when you look at something , are you excited or living or not , OK ?
I &apos;ll come back to that in a minute .
So according to my theory , when this guy looks at the object , every object , and the image goes to the visual regions and works at the fusiform gyrus , and he sees that it &apos;s a beautiful plant , or a table , or his mother , say , OK ?
And then the data goes into the amygdala , and then the autonomous nervous system .
But in this guy , the link between the nervous system and the amygdala , the emotional center of the brain , is paralyzed in the crash .
And because the fusiform gyrus will install , the guy will still recognize his mother , and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , that looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the link to the emotional center does not exist , he says , &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s my mother , how do I not feel warm in my heart ? &quot; Or horror , right ? It depends on which mother .
( Laughter ) And then he says , &quot; &quot; How do I explain the absolute absence of emotions ?
It can &apos;t be my mother .
This is somebody else who &apos;s face-to-face . &quot; &quot; How can you look at this ?
I can take every one of you and listen to you in front of a screen , and look at your skin &apos;s electrical hip , when you see images on the screen , which is to see how harmful you are when you see something , if it &apos;s a table or symmetry , you &apos;re obviously not harmful .
If it &apos;s a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a girl , you &apos;re sweating , right ?
And believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother if you &apos;re normal people , you start sweating .
You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on with this guy ?
They show him images on a screen and test his sweat .
Cats and tables and so forth , nothing , as usual , but also when you show him a picture of his mother is not harmful at all .
There &apos;s no emotional response to his mother , because the link between the visual regions and the sensory areas of the brain is cut .
His vision is normal , because his visual center will install his emotions normal , he laughs , he &apos;s crying , but the link between sight and emotions is cut and therefore he believes that his mother is a predictor .
This is a great example of what we do , we take a bizarre , bizarre psychological syndrome that can be understood and assumed that the pro-voice approach is wrong , and you can get to a more accurate explanation with the anatomy of the brain .
By the way , if that guy goes to another room , and his mother &apos;s calling him from the nearby room , he lifts the tube and says , &quot; &quot; Hey , Mom , where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no illusion through the phone .
Then she comes to him , and he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
You look like my mother . &quot; &quot; Okay ?
The reason is that there &apos;s a separate path that correlates between hearing areas in the brain to feelings and it doesn &apos;t hurt the accident .
So on the phone he recognizes his mother without a problem .
And then face to face , he claims it &apos;s predicting .
All right , so how is this complex system built in the brain ?
Is that nature ? The genes ? The environment ?
We &apos;re looking at this question with another syndrome called the Pantom organ .
You &apos;ve probably heard of the Pantom organ phenomenon .
When you give someone a hand or a leg , because of an infection , or someone loses a hand or a leg in the war , the Iraq War , for example , which has become very problematic recently , they still continue to feel in the existence of the missing hand , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called a Pantom hand or a Pantom foot .
In fact , you can get a Pantom in every organ in your body .
Believe it or not , even internal organs .
I had a patient who had a womb deforestation surgery , and she had a womb phantom , including the pain of the Panatomic cycle at the right time in the menstrual cycle .
And in fact , one student asked me if she was also getting pre-trauma syndrome ?
( Laughter ) A very important issue for science , which we haven &apos;t yet been studying .
Anyway , the next question is , what can we learn about the Pantom organs from experiments ?
One of the things we &apos;ve discovered is that about half the patients with Pantom organs say they can move the phantom .
Put a brother on his shoulder , pick up the phone , wave to peace .
These are all very strong feelings .
The patient wasn &apos;t moved .
He knows his hand is not there , but nonetheless , the feeling is very powerful for the patient .
But in the other half of patients , it doesn &apos;t happen .
The Pantom organ , they say , &quot; &quot; But Doctor , the Pantom organ is paralyzed .
It &apos;s shrinking and spaghetti and it hurts terrible .
If I could just move it around , maybe the pain would be released . &quot; &quot; Why would the Pantom organ be paralyzed ?
It sounds like oxymoron .
But looking at their documents , we found that for all of these with paralyzed Pantom organs , the original organ was also paralyzed by damaging nerves .
The nerves that drive your hand were cut by a motorcycle accident , or something like that .
So the patient had really a painful hand that was in the canal for a few months or a year , and then trying wrong to stop the pain , the surgeon took his hand off , and then he got a Pantom hand with the exact same pain , right ?
And this is a very serious clinical problem .
People get depressed .
Some of them are suicide eventually .
So how do we treat this syndrome ?
Why do they get a paralyzed Pantom organ ?
So it turns out they had a real hand before the phantom , and their neural system was cut , and the real hand became paralyzed , and there was a few months before the amputee , and then the pain continues after the amputee to the phantom .
Why is this happening ?
When the hand still existed , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands next to the front of the brain and says , &quot; &quot; Zoe ! &quot; &quot; But his eyes see it &apos;s not moving . Zoe ! Not moving . Zoe ! Not moving . Zoe ! Not moving .
And the brain learns it and determines it , and it &apos;s called Learning paralysis , OK ?
The brain learns , with the association of gold , that when it sends a command to move your hand , it feels like a paralyzed hand .
And then , as the hand moves , this learned paralysis is transferred to the body image and transferred by the phantom . Okay ?
So how do you help patients like this ?
How do you get the brain to forget the paralysis that &apos;s learned so that it will stop feeling the unbearable pain of the phantom hand ?
So we said , what if we send the command to the phantom , and we give it visual feedback as if the hand did move ?
Maybe it will release the pantom pain , the contract .
How do you do that ? Well , with virtual reality .
But it costs millions .
So I found a solution that costs three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funders .
( Laughter ) What you do is you create a mirror box .
Carton and by showing you , and you put the Pantom — the first patient Derek came .
His hand was taken 10 years ago .
He had a call of the knee nerve that was paralyzed and after a year was cut .
He had a Pantom hand with severe pain and he couldn &apos;t prevent .
Hands of Pantom is paralyzed .
He came and gave him a box and a mirror inside , as a mirror box .
And he put his arm in the mighty left phantom on the left side of the mirror , and his healthy hand on the right side , in the same seasonal position , and looked at the mirror , and what does he experience ?
He looked at the Pantom hand come alive , because he looks at the grain of the healthy hand in the mirror , and as the Panatomic hand came alive .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I asked , &quot; &quot; moving the real fingertips , watching the mirror . &quot; &quot; Of course he would get the visual experience that the phantom moves .
It &apos;s obvious . But the amazing thing is the patient shouted enthusiastically : &quot; &quot; God , my phantom moves ! &quot; &quot; And the pain forgot . Remember , the first patient — ( Applause ) Thank you . My first patient came and looked in the mirror , and I asked , &quot; &quot; Look at your phantom . &quot; &quot; He started to skip and he said , &quot; I see my phantom , &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t know .
It &apos;s just a mirror bubble , but it &apos;s still a convincing sensory experience .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Gold the healthy hand and the phantom . &quot; &quot; You know I can &apos;t move the phantom , it hurts . &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Gold the healthy hand . &quot; &quot; And he immediately said , &quot; I don &apos;t believe ! My phantom is moving ! &quot;
&quot; And the pain was lighted . &quot;
And then I asked , &quot; &quot; Huge eyes . &quot; &quot; He made his eyes .
&quot; Gold your healthy hand . &quot;
&quot; Plank — hand is frozen again . &quot;
&quot; Okay , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
He was as happy as a kid in a metal shop .
So I said , okay , this proves my theory of &quot; &quot; Learning paralysis &quot; &quot; and the crucial role of seeing it , but I won &apos;t get a Nobel Prize for being able to get someone to drive a Pantom organ .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) If you think about it , it &apos;s a completely useless talent . ( Laughter )
But then I thought that there might be other types of paralysis like a stroke or a folded dystonia — there could be a learned component that could be overcome by using a simple device like a reader .
So I said to Drake — I mean , he can &apos;t walk around with his head all the time to make it easy — I said , &quot; &quot; Take the look home and train a few weeks .
Maybe after training , you could let the mirror go , remove the learned paralysis and start moving the paralyzed hand , and so make it easier . &quot; &quot; He agreed and took the mirror to his house .
After all , it &apos;s just two dollars . After two weeks he &apos;s calling me , and he says , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you won &apos;t believe ! &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone ! &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I asked . I thought maybe the mirror box disappeared .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; The Pantom I &apos;ve had in the last 10 years .
Just disappeared . &quot; &quot; I started to fear , I said to myself , God , I changed the body image of the guy , what about the research ethics on human experiments and all that ?
So I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does that disturb you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; All of a sudden , in the last three days I had no Pantom hand , so I didn &apos;t have any pain in my elbow , in my frozen hand , and unfortunately , all the pain disappeared .
The problem is I still have Pantom fingers coming out of my shoulder , and the box doesn &apos;t get there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Can you change it and put it on my forehead so I can get rid of the Pantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
Now , why did this happen ?
The brain is experiencing a significant sensory conflict .
On the one hand , he gets visual information that the connectome came back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no corresponding response from the muscles saying no hand , right ?
And then there are motor commands that say there &apos;s a hand , and because of that conflict , the brain says , &quot; &quot; Damn &apos;t there an atom , no hand , right ?
Sort of denial — ignore the signals .
And when the hand disappears , the bonus is that the pain disappears because there may be no body pain floating through the air .
So this is the bonus .
This technique was based on dozens of patients by other groups in Helinky and might be effective as treatment for anatomic pain , and people also tried it to rebuild a brain file .
Usually you think of stroke as damage to the neural fibers , and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
But there &apos;s probably a component in the paralysis of a stroke that is paralysis learned , and maybe you can overcome it with mirrors .
This is also in clinical trials , and it helps to get patients .
Okay , let me move a walk and go to the third part of the talk , and it &apos;s about another fascinating phenomenon called Synesthesia .
It was discovered by Francis Galton in the 19th century .
Charles Darwin &apos;s cousin .
He noticed that some of the population , which in general are perfectly healthy , has the next strange phenomenon every time they see a number , has color .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight vegetables , nine indigo and so on .
Notice that these people are completely normal in other ways .
Sometimes different sounds immerse color .
Dazz is blue , here &apos;s green jam , another sound might be yellow . Okay ?
Why is this happening ?
Galton called it synesthesia , mixing senses .
We have the senses differentiated .
These people mix their senses .
Why is this happening ?
There are two interesting aspects of this problem .
First , this feature is family , so Galton said it has a inherited , genetic basis .
Secondly — and this brings me back to the main issue of the talk — creative — synesthesia that &apos;s eight times more common in artists , poets , writers and other creative people than in the rest of the population .
Why would that be ?
I &apos;ll answer that question .
We &apos;ve never answered her before .
Okay , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
So there are many theories .
One theory is they &apos;re just nuts .
It &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so you can forget about it .
Another theory they &apos;re dangerous , right ?
There may be something about this because the phenomenon is more common in the Gulf region than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) The third theory — let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in Santasia ?
So we found that the colors and numbers are very low in the brain , the fusiform gyrus .
So we said there &apos;s a random wiring between the color regions and the numbers in the brain .
So every time you see a number , you see the color corresponding to it , and therefore there is synesthesia .
Why is this happening ?
Why would there be that wiring in some people ?
Remember I said it was my family ?
That &apos;s the clue .
And that is that there &apos;s some exceptional gene , mutation in the gene that causes this extracellular wiring .
All of us , it turns out , are born when everything comes back to everything .
Every brain region is connected to every other region , and these connections are moving through a chromosome to create the typical modular structure of the adult brain .
So if the gene that &apos;s responsible for this flow mutates , then you get a mouthful defect between the areas that are close in the brain .
And if it &apos;s between the color regions and the numbers , you get a number one synesthesization .
And if it &apos;s between the sound zones and the colors , you get a color synesthesia .
That &apos;s understandable .
Now , what if this gene is expressed in all the brain , so everything is wired to everything ?
Well , think about what &apos;s common to artists , writers and poets , their ability to do metaphorical thinking , to connect concepts that are seemingly unrelated like &quot; &quot; This is the Middle East and Julia is the sun . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Julia is the sun . &quot; &quot; That means it &apos;s a burning fire ball ?
schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s another story , right ?
Healthy people say it &apos;s as warm as the sun , radiation , or as nurturing as the sun .
You immediately find the connections .
So if we assume that the increased wiring is in different parts of the brain , then it will create a increased tendency for metaphorical and creative thinking in people with synesthesia .
And so synesthesia is eight times more common in poets , artists and writers .
This is a very brain view of synesthesia .
The last demonstration — can we do another minute ?
( Applause ) Okay . I &apos;ll show you all have synesthesia , but you &apos;re in denial .
Here &apos;s a alien alphabet . Just like our alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C .
Different shapes for different sounds . Okay ?
And here you have a alien alphabet .
One of them is Kiki and one is a puppet .
Who is that ?
How many think it &apos;s Kiki and it &apos;s a puppet ? Raise your hands .
Well , one or two has mutations .
( Laughter ) How many think it &apos;s a puppet and it &apos;s Kiki ?
Ninety-nine percent .
None of you have alien , so how did you know ?
It &apos;s because you use synthetic abstract thinking . I mean , you say the monolithic shape , and the ear of these oddle-ki hair cells , mimic the visual oily shape .
And that &apos;s very important , because it means that the brain creates something fundamental — it looks like a silly illusion , but the particles of light in the eye form form form form form , and the hair cells in the ear form an autoimmune pattern , and the brain can pull out the common denominator .
It &apos;s a basic form of abstract thinking , and we now know that this is happening in a brain copyright cat because when it hits , this ability loss of stomach and puppet , and also the metaphoric ability .
If you ask a person like this what it means to &quot; &quot; not all the gold bombs is , &quot; &quot; he will say , &quot; &quot; If it goes on and explodes , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
You have to consider it . &quot; &quot; Okay ? I mean , they completely miss the metamorphic meaning .
So this region is eight times larger in humans than it is in green mammals .
Something very interesting happens in this cat , and it &apos;s the intersection between hearing , vision and the mosquito , and it &apos;s become huge in humans .
I think there &apos;s the basis for many unique human abilities like abstract thinking , metaphors and creativity .
All of these questions that philosophers study thousands of years , we scientists can begin to explore by imagining a plant , asking right questions for patients .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry about that ...
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
Fourteen years ago , I first came across this simple material , a fishing net , which has been used for centuries the same thing .
Today , I use it to create permanent forms , negotiations , sensuality on the scale of buildings in cities around the world .
I was an improbable candidate to do this .
I &apos;ve never learned sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after college I tried to get into seven art schools and rejected by all seven .
I kept being an artist , and I painted about 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright scholar to India .
With a promise to get exhibitions of images , I sent my colors and ended up in the forum .
The show show show came — my colors didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
The fishing village was known in his sculptures .
So I tried bronze stations .
But to make big shapes was too heavy and too expensive .
I went on a trip on the beach , and I looked at the fishermen collecting their networks to stack the sand .
I saw it every day , but on that day I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a new way to create a volume form without heavy and solid materials .
My first doubt sculpture was done in collaboration with these fishermen .
This is a self-portrait called &quot; &quot; broad hip . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) We put them on pages for photography .
I discovered that their soft surface revealed every hostility in forms that change all the time .
I was mesmerized .
I kept studying art traditions and collaborating with artisins , then expressing with tissue manufacturers .
I loved the fine details that they gave to my work , but I wanted to make them bigger — to become an object that looks at it for something that you could go lost in .
When I went back to India to work with these fishermen , we created a network of a million and a half connections that were tied by hand — installed for a short time in the Madrid .
Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the Uranian Manuel Solomers who redesigned the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
He asked if I could build it as a permanent representation for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do it and keep my art .
Surprisingly , engineered , permanent — all of these as opposed to singularity , subtle and fuzzy .
For two years , I was looking for a fiber that could survive in the ultraviolet rays , saltwater , pollution , and at the same time that would last long enough to move freely in the wind .
We needed something that would hold the grid out in the middle of the traffic circle .
So we showed this steel ring at 20 tons .
We had to engineer it to move in the parking lot in average pool and survive in the spirit of hurricane .
But there was no engineering program to build a model of something so ventilating and moving .
I found a very careful aeronautical engineer designed interpreters of the eaten yachts in the American Gulf called Peter Hill .
He helped me deal with the double challenge of precise form and delicate movement .
I couldn &apos;t build it in the way that I knew , because manual ties wouldn &apos;t stand in hurricane .
So I developed a relationship with a factory to create fisheries , studied the variables of their machines , and I found a way to make a competition with them .
There was no language to translate this ancient , unique manual labor into something that the machines could produce .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we lifted the Rembroidery Network on 450-square feet .
It was hard to believe that what I imagined was built now , permanent and lost nothing in doing .
( Applause ) This intersection was boring and anonymous .
Now she had a sense of place .
I went underneath her for the first time .
When I saw the choreography of the wind unfolded , I felt protected and at the same time , connected to borderless skies .
My life was about to change .
I want to create these desert landscapes of sculptures in places in cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share with you two new directions in my work .
The historic city house in Philadelphia : his square , I felt , needed a material to sculpture that was easier than anything .
So we tried tiny water particles to make a dry fog that gets shape from the wind , and in experiment we found that it can be shaped by people that can move inside without getting wet .
I use this sculpture material to mark the orbit of subway trains over the ground in real time — like X-ray that reveals the circulation of the city .
The next challenge , the International of the Americas in Denver asked if I could represent the 35 nations of their Western and connective hemisphere in the sculpture .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to start , but I said yes .
I read about the earthquake recently in Chile and the tsunami that made waves across the entire Pacific .
She moved the tectonic plates , accelerated the rotational speed and briefly the daytime .
So I called NOAA , and I asked if they could share their data on the tsunami , and I translated it into it .
And number one : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of micro seconds in which the existence broke .
I couldn &apos;t build it with a steel ring , in the way I knew .
Her shape was too complicated now .
So I replaced the steel armor with soft fabric , and still 15 times stronger than steel .
The sculpture could now be completely soft , which made it so easy that it could be connected to existing buildings — to actually be part of the fabric of the city .
There was no software that could design these complex shapes and build their model with gravity .
So we had to create it .
So I got a phone from New York that asked if I could match these ideas to Times Square or the High Line .
This new soft building system allows me to design and build these sculptures at a scale of skyscrapers .
They don &apos;t have any funding yet , but I &apos;m dreaming now to bring them to cities around the world to where they need the most .
Fourteen years ago , I was looking for beauty in traditional things , in the form of traditional arts .
Now I combine them with hytaic and engineering materials to create sensory forms , negotiating on the scale of buildings .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a phone from a friend in Phoenix .
A lawyer in the office who was never interested in art , never visited the local art museum , carrying anyone she could from the building and took them out to lie under the sculpture .
They were there in the business suits , lying in the grass , seeing the changing patterns of the wind next to people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the revelation of wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way you have to read this slide is to see your age on the horizontal axis .
After sexual adolescence , we drop out of the map .
She &apos;s six months old .
( Applause )
So when I was a kid ...
That was my team .
( Laughter ) I was really bad at sports .
I didn &apos;t like playing it , I didn &apos;t like watching it .
So that &apos;s what I did . I went to fish .
And for all of my adolescence , I &apos;ve been emphasized on the coast of Connecticut , and these are the creatures I &apos;ve seen on a regular basis .
But after I grew up and went to college , and I came home in the early &apos; 90s , that &apos;s what I found .
My team has shrunk .
It was literally like my team was destroyed .
And when I sort of looked at this , from a very personal perspective as a fisherman , I started to sort of figure out , well , what did the rest of the world think about it ?
The first place I looked at was fish markets .
And when I went to fish cliffs , despite where I was — whether I was in North Carolina , or Paris , or London , or whatever — I kept seeing these four creatures repeating themselves , over and over again — in menus , on the ice — shrimp , tuna , salmon , code .
And I thought this was very strange , and when I looked at this , I wondered , did someone else notice this kind of market shrunk ?
And as a boy , when I looked at this , I realized people didn &apos;t look at it as their team .
ordinary people , the way they looked at seafood was like this .
It &apos;s not a normal human trait to reduce the natural world into a few individual elements .
We did this before , 10,000 years ago , when we got out of the cave .
If you look at the fire ignorance from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see proteins , you &apos;ll see , you know , wolves , you &apos;ll see all sorts of different creatures .
But if you look at the telescope for that era — you know , 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
It &apos;s also true for birds .
You &apos;re looking at menus in restaurants in New York City 150 years ago , 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see a regret , beehive , dozens of ducks , dozens of geese .
But look forward to a generation of modern animal farming , and you &apos;ll see four : Indian chicken , ducks , chicken and geese .
So it makes sense that we went in this direction .
But how did we go that way ?
Well ...
First of all , it &apos;s a very new problem .
This is how we &apos;ve been discussing the oceans for the last 50 years .
The Second World War was a huge incentive to act ourselves in fighting fish .
All the technology that we &apos;ve included in World War II — sonar , light polymers — all of these things have been turned towards fish .
And so we see a massive construction in the fisheries , square over time , from the end of World War II to the present time .
And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 90 million tons of water every year .
This is the equivalent of the weight of people in China taking from the ocean every year .
And it &apos;s not a case that I use China as an example because China is now the largest fish nation in the world .
Well , it &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is the amazing increase in farming and fish farming , which is now , just in the last two years , has begun to increase the amount of wild fish that we produce .
So if you put the fish in the sea and those growing in farms together , you get equal to two China that form from the ocean every year .
And again , this is not a case that I used in China as an example , because China , in addition to being the largest fish trap , is also the largest fish farmer .
So let &apos;s look at the four choices we &apos;re doing now .
The first — the largest seafood consumed in a big difference in America and most of the West , is shrimp .
A shrimp in nature — as a wild product — is a terrible product .
2.5 , five , seven and a half pounds of fish in nature are normally killed to bring half a pound of shrimp to the market .
They &apos;re also very energetically inefficient at coming to the market .
In a recent study produced at Delhi University , it turns out that shrimp selection is one of the most harmful ways of fish in terms of carbon that you can find .
So you can grow them in farms , and people grow them in farms , and they grow them a lot in this area .
The problem is ...
The place where you grow shrimp is in these wild environments — in mangrove forests .
Now look at these wonderful roots coming down .
These are the things that hold the ground , protect the beaches , create habitats for all kinds of young fish , young shrimp , all kinds of things that matter to the environment .
Well , that &apos;s what happens to many of the coastal forests .
We &apos;ve lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves for the last 30 or 40 years .
This rate of destruction has been slowed down , but we &apos;re still in a major mangrove shortage .
The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a phenomenon that Mark Benjamin movie creator called &quot; &quot; Trying Nemo . &quot; &quot; The phenomenon is very relevant to everything you &apos;ve ever seen on tropical variation .
Because what &apos;s happening now , we have shrimp dragonflies that live shrimp , grab a huge amount of marginal animals , the marginalized animals in them and become food for shrimp .
And sometimes , a lot of these tools — manned by slaves — grab what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; garbage fish , &quot; &quot; fish we &apos;d like to see on the reef , grind them and turn them into food for shrimp — and literally habitat systems eat themselves and shoot shrimp .
The second most abundant seafood in America , and also across the West , is tuna .
So Tona is the ultimate global fish .
The huge management areas need to be tested to make tuna run well .
Our management area , called the Azi fisheries Management Organization , is called ICAT , the International Commission for preserving Atlantic tuna .
The great Netrast Carl Sina once called him , &quot; The International Magazine to catch the whole tuna . &quot;
Of course , we &apos;ve seen extraordinary improvements in ICAT over the last few years , there &apos;s a great place to improve , but still to say that tuna is a global fish , and to manage it , we have to manage the world .
Well , we can also try to grow tuna but tuna is an incredibly bad animal for agriculture .
A lot of people don &apos;t know that , but Tona is hot blood .
They can heat their bodies at 20 degrees above environmental temperature , they can swim at over 70 kilometers an hour .
So it kind of eliminates all the benefits of fish growth , right ?
A fish that grows in the farm is — or a fish with a cold blood , or it doesn &apos;t move very much .
It &apos;s a great thing to grow proteins .
But if you have this wild wild creature swimming in 70 miles an hour and warm its blood — not a good candidate for agriculture .
The next creature — the most abundant seafood in America and the West — is salmon .
Now salmon also has its flash , but it doesn &apos;t necessarily happen through fishing .
This is my home in Connecticut State .
Connecticut was the house of a lot of natural salmon .
But if you look at a map of Connecticut , every point on the map is sugar .
There are over 3,000 sugars in Connecticut State .
I often say that &apos;s why people in Connecticut are so nervous — ( Laughter ) If someone could just release the Cheetai of Connecticut , I feel that we could have a much better world .
But I came up with this particular comment at a conference of national parks once , and this guy from South Carolina pointed at me , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t have to be so hard with your Connecticut , because ours in North Carolina has 35,000 farmers . &quot; &quot; So this is a national pandemic , it &apos;s a international pandemic .
And there are dams everywhere , and these are exactly the things that stop salmon in nature from getting to their gut sites .
So as a result , we turned to aquaculture , and salmon is one of the most successful , at least from a number of viewpoints .
When they first started growing salmon , it could take up to three kilograms of wild fish to make half a kilogram of salmon fish .
The industry , for its privilege , has improved significantly .
They came at least two to one , although it &apos;s a little bit cheating because if you look at the way that aquaculture is produced , they measure laps — kilograms for salmon .
These beekeepers in turn are confined fish .
So in reality — what &apos;s called the FIFO , a fish in a fish out — kind of hard to say .
But anyway , we can credit the industry , it downloaded the amount of fish to salmon pound .
The problem is that we &apos;ve also touched the amount of salmon that we make .
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet .
It grows sometimes in something like seven percent a year .
And so even though we do less than a fish village to get it to the market , we still kill a lot of these little fish .
And it &apos;s not just fish that we feed to fish , we also feed fish to chicken and pigs .
So we have chickens that are eating fish , but strangely , we also have fish eating chickens .
Because the byproducts of chickens — feathers , blood , bones — neglected and lost to fish .
So I often wonder , are there fish eating a fish chicken that ate a fish ?
It &apos;s kind of rethinking all the chicken and swamp . Anyway — ( Laughter ) in total , however , the result is a terrible mess .
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million tons of wild creatures taken out of the oceans and being used and tested .
It &apos;s worth one third of China , or all the people in the United States who are taken from the sea every year .
The last of the four is kind of an amorphous thing .
This is what the industry calls &quot; &quot; white fish . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of fish coming into this white fish , but the way of telling the story , I think , is through the classic version of American colonial invention , Sandwich the fish .
So Sandwich Fed actually started with the cloning .
And he started because on a local franchise found that when he acquired his McDonald on Friday , no one came .
Because it was a Catholic community , they needed fish .
So he went to Kay Crock and said , &quot; I &apos;ll get you Sandwich fish , which will be made out of the robot . &quot;
Ray Cruck said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it will work .
I want to do a birthday burger , and there will be a piece of rapes inside the Germany .
But let &apos;s do that , let &apos;s bet .
If his Sandwich is more addicted , it will be the winner Sandwich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of a sad thing to the ocean that Hula Burger didn &apos;t win .
So he did the Sandwich Hallbot .
Unfortunately , the Sandwich cost 30 cents .
Ray wanted the Sandwich to sell at 25 cents , so he turned to Atlantic code .
We all know what happened to the Atlantic code in New England .
So now the fish Sandwich is made from Pollock Alaska , is the largest tapir fish in the United States , one to 1.5 billion pounds of fish that find every year from the sea .
If we finish the Pollock , the next choice will probably be Tilphia .
Tilphia is one of the fish none of them heard about 20 years ago .
It &apos;s actually a very efficient conversion of vegetable protein for living protein , and it was a rescue for the physical world .
It &apos;s actually a very sustainable solution , it goes from an egg to adult in nine months .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it doesn &apos;t do what the West wants it to do .
It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called a fat fish profile .
It doesn &apos;t have the EPA and DHA Omega-3 that we all think will make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the glucose ?
The fish represents a huge part of 20 to 30 million tunas .
Well , one possibility that many conservatives have come up with is , can we eat them ?
Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon ?
There are many arguments for this .
They &apos;re very energetically efficient to come to the market , a tiny fraction of the fuel , say , shrimp , and at the top of the carbon efficiency scale .
They &apos;re also very rich in Omega-3 , a great source of EPA and DHA .
So that &apos;s potential .
And if we were to go down that path , what I would say is , instead of paying a few dollars a kilo — or a few dollars per ton , really — and turn it into fish food , can we cut the fish and double the price for fisheries and do it our way of treating these particular fish ?
Other possibilities with that , which is much more interesting , is to look at the oysters , especially in the obstacles .
Now , high-value treatments of EPA and DHA , they &apos;re similar to tuna in a box .
They &apos;re also very energetically efficient .
To bring a kilogram of cats to the market is about one in three parts of the carbon required to bring beef to the market .
They don &apos;t require food fish at all , they actually get their Omega-3 by filming microalgae from the water .
In fact , from there the Omega-3 comes , it doesn &apos;t come from fish .
Microalgae creates Omega-3 , it &apos;s just biodegradable in fish .
Other deserts and oysters do a huge amount of water filtration .
A single Molly can filter tens of gallons every day .
And it &apos;s incredibly important when we look at the world .
Right now , neutralizing , overuse of the phosphates in our waterways causes huge algae disorders .
More than 400 new dead areas have been created in the last 20 years , huge sources of death of marine life .
We can also look at no fish at all .
We can look at the vegetables .
We can look at algae , the brown sea algae , all the different kinds of things that can be rich in Omega-3 , can be rich in proteins , really great things .
They filter the water just like cats .
And strangely , it turns out you can actually feed cows in them .
Now , I &apos;m not a big fan of beef .
But if you want to keep growing cattle in time and where limited water resources are , you grow algae in water , you don &apos;t have to drink them — important consideration .
And the last fish is a question mark .
We have the ability to make agriculture fish that create a net advantage of marine protein for us .
The creature would have to be vegetarian , it would have to grow fast , it would have to be adapted to a changing climate and it would have to have a profile , the EPA , DHA , Omega-3 acidic acids that we &apos;re looking for .
It &apos;s kind of on the paper .
I &apos;ve reported these issues for 15 years .
Every time I do a new story , someone says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do all this . We can do it . We &apos;ve got all this .
We can make fish that are a positive advantage of marine protein and has Omega-3 . &quot; &quot; Great .
It doesn &apos;t seem to increase the scale of this .
It &apos;s time to make it bigger .
If we do that , 30 million tons of seafood , one third of the world &apos;s fish , will remain in water .
So I guess what I &apos;m saying is that this is what we &apos;ve gone with .
We tend to walk with our appetite instead of our brains .
But if we go with it , or sort of a configuration of it , we might have a little bit more of it .
Thank you .

Sorry , thank you . That was fun .
Half my left brain , ours , is a different place in the kidney .
Half of our left brain is thinking widely and systematically .
And also half of our left brain is thinking with language .
And all I could recognize is this energy , energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And I felt lightning in the body .
