This is of my own making .

that &apos;s small comfort
That &apos;s a bit thick . , That &apos;s coming it strong .
the question has to be put differently
That &apos;s nothing !
That &apos;s a dodgy situation .
That &apos;s another story .
That &apos;s a fine mess ! , That &apos;s a pretty kettle of fish .
That &apos;s a pretty mess !

It &apos;s all in the day &apos;s work . , It &apos;s nothing to write home about .
There &apos;s more to it than that .
that &apos;s only fair
that &apos;s bad luck
That &apos;s anyone &apos;s guess .
this wants cleaning
That &apos;s half the battle .
of course . , That &apos;s true
It &apos;s very good of you .

This isn &apos;t everybodys job .
it &apos;s not worth the effort ( involved )
This is something like !
There &apos;s no denying .
That won &apos;t my case .
I can do it on my head .
I won &apos;t be a party to that
that makes no difference
that doesn &apos;t matter
that may be so
mistrustfulness
This calls for a celebration .
Give him his due .
years of discretion
That &apos;s what I call smart .
the next time
to raise the wind
That &apos;s no advantage to you !
to turn inside out
put the cart before the horse

The murder is out .
cleanliest
That won &apos;t hurt .

The weather keeps up .
the weather is very close
the weather looks promising
an outline of the main points
I should say so !
I won &apos;t argue that point .
That &apos;s saying a lot .
tongues will wag
that remains to be seen
But you know that !
to rise to speak
to suit the action to the world
That won &apos;t wash with me .
That cuts no ice .

I think he &apos;s out of the wood now . , I think I &apos;ve been done . , I think it will rain .
I don &apos;t believe a word of it
I don &apos;t think so
I think so
I just managed it .
I &apos;ve got it .
I didn &apos;t catch the word
I missed the connection .
I didn &apos;t catch the sentence .
I &apos;m fed up with strikes .
I have a dodgy leg .
I &apos;ve a bad cold .
I have a day off
I have it from a good source . , I have it from a good sourse .
I just managed it
I heard it this morning on the radio .
I told you so
I told you so .
I arranged it in advance

I &apos;m fed up with it , I &apos;m sick of it
I &apos;m fed up with it . , I &apos;m tired of it .
I &apos;ve known it to happen .
I forgot about it
I &apos;ve nothing on tonight .
I landed him one in the face .
I asked his advice
I happend to meet him , I happened to meet him
I didn &apos;t get a wink of sleep .
I haven &apos;t any money .
I have no small change .
I haven &apos;t the faintest idea

I &apos;ll be damned if I know !
I &apos;ve enough and to spare
I have a room of my own
I can &apos;t take any more
I &apos;ve changed my mind .
I &apos;ve an upset stomach .
I &apos;ve burnt my fingers
I was quite disconcerted to realize
I have not the faintest idea .
I have no objections
I have no objections .
let &apos;s suppose that I &apos;m right
I need some rest badly
I need some rest badly .
I didn &apos;t quite catch what you said .
I &apos;ve other fish to fry .
I was completely browned off .
I had expected better of it
I hope you &apos;ll back my plan .
I hope so
I chanced to hear it
I chanced to hear it .
I can make nothing of it .
I &apos;m afraid I couldn &apos;t go along with that
I can &apos;t bear this heat .
I can &apos;t perform miracles !
I can tell you a thing or two about it
I can do it by myself
I can ill afford it .
I can &apos;t afford it
I can &apos;t afford it .
I can &apos;t get at it
I can &apos;t help doing it .
I can &apos;t do it

I stick on the stamp .
I &apos;ll just drop in for a second .
I can manage with less
I &apos;ll arrive a week tomorrow .
I couldn &apos;t get a word in edge-wise .
I wish I could stay
I was terribly bored .
Who do they take me for ? , Who do they think I am ?
I refuse to be rushed .
I love to read
I am fond of reading .
I had it done .
I had her sit down .
I &apos;ll do it this minute .
I don &apos;t care a fig for it .
I call it a day .
I &apos;ve got to go to the loo .
I &apos;m dying to go to the loo .
I have to do an errand .
I have to start bright and early .
I must go to the bathroom .
I &apos;m surprised at you !
I &apos;m bound to say
I had to swallow a lot
I should like to
I should like to
I wonder who he is
I want to read in peace .
I would rather
I don &apos;t want that much
I suppose so
I &apos;m not going to mince matters .
I &apos;m bursting with curiosity
I &apos;m bursting with curiosity .
I won &apos;t lift a finger
I won &apos;t lift a finger .
I &apos;ll give you the low down .
It was brought home to me .
I felt impelled to say it .
I was on pins and needles
I just managed it .
I slept like a top
I slept like a top .
I fail to see
myself
I put all my eggs in one basket .
I assume that these facts are known
I carried my point .
I &apos;m to go tomorrow
I ought to , I ouhgt to
I &apos;m on his side
I prefer standing , I prefer to stand
I get my watch an hour ahead .
I &apos;m starving
I called at your house .
I &apos;m in the dark .
I did it at his suggestion
I told him what was most important .
I happened to meet him .
I chanced to meet her .
I don &apos;t like the look of it
I daren &apos;t go home , I &apos;m scared to go home
There &apos;s something in the wind .
I don &apos;t trust him an inch
I put ( have ) no trust in his words
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears ( eyes )
I &apos;ll do it this minute
Language , sir !
I owe him much .
I insist on obedience .
I count on you .
It &apos;s all Greek to me .
I get it
I get it .
I see !
I trust him .
to look away in disgust
I &apos;ve been extremely busy lately . , I &apos;ve been extremly busy lately .
I &apos;m waiting to hear your explanation .
I should prefer to wait until evening .
I should prefer to wait .
I wash my hands
I wash my hands of it
I wash my hands of it .
I know my own mind .
I know where the shoe pinches
I know about it
I know about it .
I &apos;m blessed if I know . , I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t know .
I defy you to do it
I don &apos;t know a thing about it
I &apos;m at a loss what to do .
I &apos;m at a loss what to do
I don &apos;t know anything about it
I &apos;ll think it over .
I &apos;ll never make it
I &apos;ll never make it .
I &apos;ll keep my fingers crossed
I &apos;ll give him what for !
I &apos;ll see you further first .
I &apos;ll act on your advice .
I &apos;ll act on your advice
I &apos;ll do my level best
I will take good care not to do that .
I &apos;ll see to it at once .
I won &apos;t hear of it
I mean to say
don &apos;t let me keep you
I got soaked to the skin .
I was delayed by the rain
I was cordially received .
I became familiar with him .
I wish I could stay
I had rather wait , I would rather wait
I paid him out in his own coin .
I for one
I &apos;m in doubt about it
I &apos;m annoyed about it .
