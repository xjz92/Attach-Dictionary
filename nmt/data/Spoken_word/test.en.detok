I have a dream that we can stop thinking
is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
when we're asking people to engage with our agenda
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?
And one of the problems that we face, I think,
is that the only people that have cornered the market
if we get the right numbers to go up,
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system,
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff
that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress,
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,
We all need to love and be loved in life.
We want to be healthy and live a full life.
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life --
And we created, at the organization that I work for,
because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation
at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
And this is a measure of how much well-being
And probably the easiest way to show you that,
which is a measure of how much resources we use
and how much pressure we put on the planet.
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,
but they're using a lot of planet to get there.
are countries that are not producing much well-being --
The average life expectancy in many of these countries
that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
The country on its own up at the top
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,
that are used typically in [the] Western world --
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
Their government is one of the first to commit
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about --
and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,
but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
And this is the trend in well-being over that time,
And the point really is, is that I think,
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
That is changing the way we create our organizations,
we do our government policy and we live our lives.
and say that quality of life is going to reduce.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
They want to hold on to what they've got.
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,
but the point is we need to turn those curves.
And this is where I think we can take a leaf
put the right information at the right point of time.
and you see how much electricity you're using right now,
your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
Why is it, on the radio news every evening,
I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio --
I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,
and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message
and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.
What are the five things that you should do every day
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,
lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts --
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do
but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
Do you invest the time with your loved ones
step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
How aware are you of things going on around the world,
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
It can be learning to cook a new dish,

two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves
You measure their happiness at the end of the day,
those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier

And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition

that we can all create a world we all want,
On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday,
I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes
and my father was reading the paper or something,
and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake
and get a lot of presents? "And my dad said," Well, yes.
But, more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason,
and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man. "
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.
my second-grade class at school. But when she said it,
the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations
and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil,
and anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason."
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
And my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church
that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong,
but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
So, you've grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now
God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record. "
And I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time,
up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it? "
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
All that being good and no real credit for it.
And, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information
until the very day that it was basically useless to me? "
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right? "
I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her.
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus. "
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus:
how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed
that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve,
who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning,
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass
on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,
and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back
to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence:
and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,
this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly --
but, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa,
about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,
they had to be old enough to be able to understand
the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house
at this public school playground. It was a Saturday,
and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,
and then you're capable of committing any and all sins
against God and man. "And Bill said," So? "And then I said,
"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to
and God won't notice it. "And he said," So? "And I said,
"So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically
and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus."
but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,
but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,
September 10 is not your birthday. It's October 10. "And I said," What? "
And she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15."
"So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10,
and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place,
so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready. "
I thought about it, and when I was four,
and my mother even had another child to come,
so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready,
"Don't worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday
that you ate a piece of cake that day. "
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information
was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party
what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom,
and I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,
but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
This was around the time that I started filling out physically,
and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,
and, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale
and I started to read my new Libra horoscope,
and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven
when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month
to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,
and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning
for people who are peddling things door to door.
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang
and just start robbing people if I only buy
So, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.
in white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
and they said they had a message for me from God.
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,
but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people
when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious,
so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy,
because I don't think this happens to them all that often.
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water --
OK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.
You can't put a video of myself in front of me
OK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,
and after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,
but, you know, I don't like that word, heart,
and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God. "
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys,
so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said
like that was the right answer. And then they said,
"Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
And I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved
that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,
everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them:
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat
and I will lead you out of here. "And God did lead them.
I said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants
reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years
there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,
and the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them --
and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil --
every single one of them just bad to the bone.
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,
on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good --
they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
And he made sure this whole story was written down
Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S."
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended
from a people who were totally evil? "And they said," Yes. "
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith
found those buried gold plates right in his backyard,
and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat
and then buried his face into, and this allowed him
to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys
I wanted to say, "OK, don't start with this story."
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start --
-- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us
through his righteous prophets? "And I said," No, I don't. "
Because I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story
and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was,
I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said,
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women? "
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said,
"Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular,
it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be
much less violent than men? But, no, it wasn't any of these gifts.
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby
every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45,
it still seems like some women would have some time left over
to hear the word of God. "And they said," No. "
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more,
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon
and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die
you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity. "
-- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me. "
And they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe
that when you go to heaven you get your body restored
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
I said, "Oh -- now, I don't have a uterus because I had cancer
a few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven
I would get my old uterus back? "And they said," Sure. "
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
Would God force you to get your old nose back?
Well, then they gave me this Book of Mormon,
and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter,
and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me,
and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry,"
or maybe it was just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys,
and smug in my more conventional faith. But then,
the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology
and dogma for the very first time, and they said,
"We believe that God impregnated a very young girl
and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us --
-- and she had a baby, and that's the son of God, "
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
But the question they asked me when they first arrived
Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.
Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered,
"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused,
and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love
and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see. "
But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it,
because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
that most of us in India learn when we are children.
Since then -- it's been four decades now --
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
and you'll get back to doing what you do best. "
that I, who thought I had complete control of my life,
wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
and I declared to the world at large...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,
and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life. "
and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,
that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio --
body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio,
which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
to the attention of something that so animates you,
armed as I am with what medication can provide
as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,
I want to be known not as a cancer survivor,
I present to you an excerpt of that work
when I wanted to reframe the way we use information,
the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --
18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,
kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:
I wrote the code and put it out there.
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer
lots of people coming from all over the world.
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
if I wanted to figure out how to build something
out of a bit of this and a bit of this,
everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,
I had to learn to run some new program,
I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.
being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin
and even if people don't read your memo --
actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web
so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
What was difficult was to get them to imagine:
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
And that is what has made it most fun.
not the technology, not the things people have done with it,
but actually the community, the spirit of all these people
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --
I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
because we've found out that the things that happen with the web
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --
in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --
and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation
which just shattered a lot of myths that people had
He put up a slide a little bit like this.
and that's how we think of it, isn't it?
But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives
and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
In this case, Hans had put the data together
he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces
of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
And I was happy to see that at the party last night
that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,
but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web
and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:
we're using them for things that the documents are about.
We're using them for people, we're using them for places,
we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up
and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data
I will get back some data in a standard format
which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,
So the second rule is I get important information back.
Third rule is that when I get back that information
it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship
is given one of those names that starts HTTP.
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then
I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots
and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.
but for each of those plants, whatever it is --
a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --
is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin
who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,
with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,
and put it into a blob of linked data
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide
and if you actually go and look up Berlin,
you'll find that there are other blobs of data
which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,
you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing
that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,
there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
I'm just going to mention a few of them
so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,
so that you also see how much unlocked potential.
that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,
but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments
Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data
these people, they're very tempted to keep it --
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go
who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses
people come up with to hang onto their data
and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious
of the huge challenges that human society has right now --
understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment
In fact, I'll just go into one area --
drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out
this is a great way of getting out of those silos,
because they had their genomics data in one database
in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --
and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --
32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --
the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up
and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions
You just -- you log on to your social networking site,
your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person."
Every time you do things on the social networking site,
the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --
and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
But, when you go to another linked data site --
and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap
The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --
The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,
I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.
and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
I did that to the map. I just did that!
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit
And that is what linked data is all about.
to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there
I've only told you a very small number of things
There are data in every aspect of our lives,
and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,
And when you connect data together, you get power
in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
You get this really huge power out of it.
where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --
even though there's not an immediate return on the investment
because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --
they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things
which would be good if everybody else did them.
You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED
is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen:
And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will,
about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
There was a very important study done a while ago
at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is
that when all of us have so many opportunities to help,
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary
were told that they were going to give a practice sermon
Half of those students were given, as a topic,
to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building
As they went from the first building to the second,
each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning,
clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help?
of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop
was how much of a hurry they thought they were in --
were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed
And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives:
There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.
And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience
That is to say, if we attend to the other person,
that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain
exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering,
we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves,
if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day,
And this difference between the self and the other focus
I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point
where I was listing all of the donations I gave,
and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check
to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought,
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving
was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas
that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus
for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back
and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman,
who was in the singles scene. And this woman says,
so he's trying speed dating. "I don't know if you know speed dating?
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table,
and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo,
whether to give her card or her email address to the man
"My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself;
And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section
of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages --
because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage
she had a simple test she put people to.
The test was: from the moment they got together,
how long it would take the guy to ask her a question
And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.
Now this is a -- it's a little test
I encourage you to try out at a party.
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called
"The Human Moment," about how to make real contact
with a person at work. And they said, well,
the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry,
There is a newly coined word in the English language
for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry
or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in
I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror --
and I think it affected him a little bit.
At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard,
decided to write a book about a serial killer.
This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in
many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.
And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents,
his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy,
So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage
to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to,
and that is: how could you have done it?
These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims.
"Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off. "
and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities
the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice
the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological
or does it just end up at landfill? In other words,
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room,
but we don't see it. And we've become victims
of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown
and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences
for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance,
who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com,
Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this,
in China formed a joint venture with their dye works
would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
Right now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt
over the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?
there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store
to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it
back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes
that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous,
you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous,
you can go into -- today, go into any store,
put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode,
They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.
That website could tell you things about that object.
we might be able to make a compassionate choice.
There's a saying in the world of information science:
And the question is: will it make a difference?
Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times,
it was in the '80s, I did an article
on what was then a new problem in New York --
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency
that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless
through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients
that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me --
what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where,
when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless
in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day,
I went down -- I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour
and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs
I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side,
shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him --
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened,
I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people
And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English,
he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving,
someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.
But all it took was that simple act of noticing,
bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,
For her, life had distilled itself into one task:
If we were captured, first my sister and I,
I don't remember the pirates who came many times,
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig
given to me by the men on the rig.
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you."
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came
relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,
And for that work, when I was a final year law student,
I was chosen as the young Australian of the year.
invited to speak in venues she had never heard of
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort
ending each day as they had for almost 20 years,
the three of us still in the same bed.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education
and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised.
so many of them doing the thing they loved,
I realized I could not settle into a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now
to know that, yes, the world does fall apart,
I gathered around me a small team of people
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup
I made the decision to move to the U.S.

she caused a sensation by taking him to court
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney
and assured her that we were still with her.
and told us he had to close the casket.
"Why is it that her hand is so warm
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
Given who we were and how life had shaped us,
that the men who might have come into our lives
Now I would like to have my own children,
Can I give them a bow in their lives,
Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today
Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.
because I had an apology to make to her.
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --
she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
And I went home to my wife that night
and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,
And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler
I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.
And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?
RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:
you must not talk about your own business, and this,
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,
RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,
I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,
inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.
And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive
and I love taking on, you know, the status quo
So I've seen life as one long learning process.
And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline
and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,
21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create
the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.
And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.
because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.
And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,
at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records
and his view was that you were trading, you know,
for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.
RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.
And I think if you start a business without financial backing,
you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.
They were trying to put our airline out of business,
and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.
And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down
And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,
and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,
I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,
RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.
But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.
CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot
and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.
What does the brand stand for in your head?
RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,
that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --
CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?
RB: No, but I was going to move on this.
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.
As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,
and I think, you know, we do it differently
and I think that industries are not quite the same
CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done
where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.
I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.
I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?
RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.
I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,
But about three months after the launch of the condom company,
and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.
But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.
And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,
I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby
CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.
CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.
RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.
CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times
and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.
RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.
RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --
CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --
Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?
When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well
and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --
CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --
and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"
and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --
CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.
And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?
RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'
"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected
that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.
But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.
CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?
Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard
CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just...
CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.
RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.
CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,
RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months
people will be able to take a ride into space.
RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:
the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.
and the space station will be one giant eye,
you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.
And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.
But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.
CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?
so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.
CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.
RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But...
CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.
I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.
Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --
and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.
you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --
CA: What was the closest you got to --
when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,
nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,
so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,
when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,
whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.
And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,
as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --
the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,
the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --
and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me
jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.
CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and...
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,
the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I...
CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.
RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,
with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,
trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --
and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.
CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?
RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,
and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,
I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried
to make sure that I was making the right decision.
And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,
And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.
I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,
it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,
and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.
and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:
I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --
CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,
you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy
doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.
How much was the PR value part of this?
RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,
the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,
you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?
RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.
And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.
And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.
I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,
I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,
but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.
And so, it's like, good news or bad news?
And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.
CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?
RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --
RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,
"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.
and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.
And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,
CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,
but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,
but just a bit of a... Were you a rebel then, or how would you...
RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I... And I was,
and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.
CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.
allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."
she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.
So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,
and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,
And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.
And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,
and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.
Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think
they're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,
we're going to raise a generation of privileged...
RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,
you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.
So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm...
I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --
he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,
RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act
On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --
we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.
you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.
So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us
if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.
So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.
And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"
the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested
for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.
And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert
to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.
and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.
It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century. "
And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"
And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --
and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"
RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually
And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so...
A lot of people would say there's no way
that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.
Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?
of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,
people will come back and come back for more.
And I think all you have in life is your reputation
of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,
and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.
CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --
you keep getting caught up in these new projects,
but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.
each time you step into something big and new?
RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,
so from the time the kids were very young,
you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.
Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,
we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --
so I can take them there and we can bring friends,
but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.
RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.
extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,
and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.
who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing
for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,
but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs
CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,
RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind
and we are putting a lot of time and energy into,
and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize
in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,
in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions
cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.
We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way
And we just -- you know, there weren't really people
working on that before, so we wanted people to try to --
all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,
And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms
And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.
CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?
RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called
the war room, which is maybe the wrong word.
We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war room
to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,
if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,
that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.
CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West
get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,
in their ability to make a difference in the world.
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,
we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,
I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --
here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation
and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?
RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting
HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,
of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,
it's a way of working with him, with his government.
It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,
they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how
But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,
CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,
or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by
some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,
for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.
people do things for a whole variety of different reasons
and I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,
I will want to feel that I've made a difference
And that may be a selfish thing to think,
CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him
and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by
this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.
50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom
and what would you like your legacy to be?
RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,
so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.
No, I just want to live life to its full.
I hope to be able to make a difference.
And I think one of the positive things at the moment is
you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,
who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,
And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.
that people in that kind of position do make a difference.
CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,
I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --
I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless
and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.
And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,
well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,
It's like after every exam, when I walk out,
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
in the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
and I didn't know where else to find myself.
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown
each and every corner of my life at that time.
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
So it was good to survive with that little tool
that I found to find my own place in school.
I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.
So at that time -- and I was 13 --
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible.
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
what I really want to do with art work, or art
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking,
It can be ruins, or it can be music,
or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
So here are some of the works I would like to show you.
It's just a trace of being in this body.
you know -- what I really enjoyed the most
and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
So this is what I was talking about, while molding,
or moving my hand or, moving around in the space,
because this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid;
but after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint
whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace,
it just shows what is on the other side.
So I just put the paper on the focal length,
then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India
she'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
"I imagine a world where all cows will be free
and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow. "
he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road,
if he saw the same cow, he would say,
"Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
and most of the time, we don't see what it is.
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
But if you tear it in the middle --
you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch --
but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
this is the first skin, and this is the second,
and there's a third, and each creates a meaning.
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators --
and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception --
whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,
is there anything behind, are there any traces up there,
after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months,
This is the work I made out of that material.
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting,
saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
and we will give you all the details, "and they gave.
"It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
In India, nobody really talks about works of art;
which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything,
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait,"
it may not be the portrait after a few months.
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
"Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
Don't you think it remained something about death, "they said.
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
or we can break the sculpture and get the dust,
but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe. "
the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark,
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light,
So we don't see dark, we don't see light,
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that --
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world
it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
go to the other side of the wall, like in logic,
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,
and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late' 50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community
and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,
so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,
and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,
there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,
away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --
that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market
that could be exported and also service our local market.
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,
it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,
and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,
because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:
we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,
that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --
the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,
the more force is needed to change its positioning.
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object
to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --
because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle
so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,
and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,
And if you think about the number of people
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --
What this means is you can gather more and more data
and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory
you can invest for a long time in a brand,
building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,
that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,
one bad week can undermine decades of good work.
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --
which is a measure of the disorder of a system,
the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager
and put it out there like the Conservative Party did
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,
that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
who can tell me what this is called in French?
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,
which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,
that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago
and another person -- yes -- to play the melody
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it?
which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century,
But I want to start with my work on romantic love,
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love,
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted;
and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
And so I want to tell you about that first,
and then go on into where I think love is going.
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question
since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was
by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research --
and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
The first thing that happens is what I call --
a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
he said, "The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
He said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."
You can list what you don't like about them,
but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
I decided I would read poetry from all over the world,
and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China,
because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody
their car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Chen:
"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out. "
probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain,
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning,
As one Polynesian said, he said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
You feel intense elation when things are going well;
mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
As one businessman in New York said to me, he said, "Anything she liked, I liked."
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually,
you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
The whole point of this is to pull two people together
strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving:
an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.
You'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them,
but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,
The motor in your brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
And last but not least, it is an obsession.
When I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine,
But my most important question was always the same.
It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
And indeed, they would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."
And then, the very last question I would ask them --
I would always have to work myself up to this question,
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph,
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
In fact, one of the most important was a brain region
that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions,
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind,
the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of mind -- part of the mind --
when you want to win that promotion at work.
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank you,"
you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.
People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love.
They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth
And I've also come to think that it's one of three
basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love:
that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there,
You know, you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy
And I think that attachment, the third brain system,
evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- --
at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years,
that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems:
lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
The first is women working, moving into the workforce.
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
And everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market --
sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market --
and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa,
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago,
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.
I'll only just say a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
I don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike.
There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,
"I think that we were built to be -- we're like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
And we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain.
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.
Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation
goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
They held that baby in front of their face,
where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market,
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me,
who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.
"To have a great writer is to have another government."
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
It's one of many, many characteristics that women have
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected,
they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think,
put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous,
focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
When the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world.
When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society,
a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood
But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say,
And I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
express less remorse for the partners that they do,
marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression
that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago,
because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage,"
moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men
would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner,
if they were not in love with that person.
People around the world, in a study of 37 societies,
want to be in love with the person that they marry.
Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
I even think that marriages might even become more stable
The first one being women moving into the job market,
that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85,
as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
And I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America,
I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements
-- women have never been as interesting as they are now.
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution
when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
In these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment --
and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.
With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin --
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment,
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner
while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else,
while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
In fact, you can lie in bed at night
and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person
to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head
as you are trying to decide what to do.
So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy;
we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.
I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.
I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, serotonin-enhancing --
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
I've got nothing against people who take them short term,
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.
And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment.
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese
and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike.
And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me
and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person? "
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
That's my current project; it will be my next book.
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious,
in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain,
probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your "love map,"
an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.
gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too --
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the --
It was a graduate student at -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student,
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody,
you can drive up the dopamine in the brain,
and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
And sure enough -- I've never been in one,
but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks
and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine,
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw,
and she throws her hands up and she says, "Wasn't that wonderful?"
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives:
the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
They're going to survive as long as our species survives
I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,
how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?
what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?
when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
I thought it was so cool as a little boy
when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln
And I decided about that time, about age 10,
that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,
until -- I think I was about 12 --
and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts
just about the same time I hit some ice
and met him at the front door with the car --
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.
and it really cemented my love affair with cars
But cars are really more than a passion of mine;
I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.
really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company
and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.
And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan
and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in
when I would go to some stream that I'd loved,
and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.
at a very basic level, sunk in with me.
And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,
and that we filled the skies with smog --
whether or not this is really the right thing to do.
And as I look back over 30 years ago,
it was a little naive to think at that age
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management
Of course, I had no intention of doing that,
I mean, I think most people in the industry
understand that we've got to get on with it.
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,
not only at Ford, but really as an industry.
we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate --
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.
And actually, although we've got a long way to go
I can see the day where my two great passions --
as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem --
and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,
but even as we're in the process of doing that,
is now being threatened, just as the environment is.
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,
and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow
our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.
to between two and four billion cars by mid century.
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock
that this is going to have on our daily lives.
and that's a huge waste of time and resources.
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this --
So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.
it's clear that the mobility model that we have today
Well I think you probably already have the picture.
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.
"If I had asked people then what they wanted,
And to connect our country after World War II,
that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,
and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute
they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.
when our cars can begin talking to each other.
Very soon, the same systems that we use today
from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.
But very soon we're going to see the days
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,
to get me home in the best possible way.
and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown
and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.
your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive --
which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel
and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone
so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.
and telling you all the best route to take home
so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,
more cars, more roads or a new rail system;
but we've got to be willing to get out there
or some other way we haven't even thought of yet;
and it's really been amazing to me to watch
We need that same kind of passion and energy
But we need people like all of you in this room,
And we need people from all walks of life;
to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.
It's going to really require a national energy policy,
because the solutions in each country are going to be different
But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.
more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.
and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.
and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go --
the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,
all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination
to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.
we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life
and freedom to move around the country and around the world
This is a big one, and it won't wait.
One of the threads that seems to have come through
loud and clear in the last couple of days
is this need to reconcile what the Big wants --
the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country --
and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
And how do you bring those two things together?
about this need to bring consumers, to bring people
And that's what I want to talk about today.
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,
I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in,
and something that we kind of bring to life
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room --
that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,
what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,
And rather than talk about it in the theory,
I think I'm just going to show you an example.
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota
to describe to them what their patient experience was.
I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart
with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing
with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,
all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --
this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
from the point of view of the person out --
as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things
that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,
so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,
Very small example of something that they could do.
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --
said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,
like changing the floor going into the patient's room
so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" --
was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
So you went from public space to private space.
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --
was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,
then they put them on one wall of the patient's room,
So that what you could actually do was go into the room
and write messages to the person who was sick in that room,
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
I thought that was a really, really nice example.
kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another
and was wondering why it took these guys so long
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --
was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,
sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention --
saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,
when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes,
seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh
and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --
they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --
it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --
which was the procedure that this device's data was about;
it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,
was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --
which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,
but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture
sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED
and just watching all of these kind of things happen
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --
and the things we kind of do in our environment
that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,
Why do we all follow the line in the street?
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
Again, we're sort of using the world around us
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital. "
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,
that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
we take one item and transfer it to another.
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,
"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
that's permission for them to do the same thing.
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --
is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,
And putting yourself in the position of the person,
and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again
from this conference is how do we put ourselves
in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
And I think that's what this is very much about.
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter
that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference
is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump
and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
When you put yourself in the position of these people,
things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up
and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant
than the form of it. The way it's produced,
it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,
to feel good about a product we were actually designing,
and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets
to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda
over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year --
and to explore and to touch on some observations
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it,
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago,
before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,
that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired
in a way celebrating the places and the spaces
so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,
[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought
about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,
"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006
was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue. "
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back,
"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"
when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system,
I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,
in a way, a number of things were happening.
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru --
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,
but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,
that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,
And all the components are there which are now
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.
where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,
there is the reality that that has become humanized,
all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
the [unclear], which is a further kind of development --
and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
So, something which in [the] '50s,' 60s was very exclusive
and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --
quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves --
as architects, or anybody involved with the design process --
that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
they're only a component of a much bigger picture.
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,
between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.
But again, that only shows part of the picture.
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,
in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison
what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city --
and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
and more and more roads, and more and more energy
in the transport of people between the city center --
which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived
of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example --
and Munich is not a bad example of that,
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --
then a city which is really only twice as dense,
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate
that as the density increases along the bottom there,
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like
the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,
is not dense compared with the really dense cities.
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,
33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,
If you take China, and you just take Beijing,
and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy
as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,
statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world --
and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
So, if we think of the transition in our society
of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,
then that same process is happening in 20 years.
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,
and I look at the implication over a similar period of time
in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,
and I cite our own experience as a company,
and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --
then how do you measure that change of technology?
to the creation of buildings which consume less energy,
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early' 70s.
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters
in a small market town in the northeast of England,
is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of
which is also about the celebration of public space.
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,
encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,
where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,
it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
And the award was about a celebration for a building
which had been in use over a long period of time.
what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail,
really what it is saying is you can wire this building.
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors
had to build new buildings for the new technology.
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
Round about that design period leading up to this building,
I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,
to do what would be really interesting on that building.
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble --
would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting
is that the technology is now available and celebratory.
The library of the Free University, which opened last year,
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands
the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,
and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,
and where it's really working with the forces of nature.
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,
and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.
but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability,
out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,
So if you cross the border -- just across the border --
a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad
in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
And again, the way in which that works as a building,
for those of us who can enjoy the spaces,
If I made the leap into these new technologies,
then how did we -- what happened before that?
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,
which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
and the many kilometers of cable and so on.
And the turning point was probably, in our terms,
And that was at the time that we sought
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --
you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light --
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.
and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,
and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
as a public place where we sought to, in a way,
public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto --
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,
but this very, very much a part of the ecology.
But here, not having to model it for real.
to explore, to plan, to see how that would work
natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil --
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission
at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons --
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality --
something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further --
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,
is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.
If, for example, you seek to do a building
which goes right to the edge of the pavement,
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.
and the way in which triangulation can increase performance
and also give that building its sense of identity.
And here, if we look at a detail of the way
that the building opens up and breathes into those atria,
the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,
we can see the high pressure, the low pressure,
the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
So it also has the ability, all the time,
to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
what happens if we seek to use such design strategies
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea
that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba
using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,
what if that, instead of being just a pipe,
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,
And if you just go back to the previous image,
and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,
that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture
could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together
in a united cause, in terms of something that would be
And how do we make more legible in this growing world,
especially in some of the places that I'm talking about --
China, for example, which in the next ten years
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together
at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
And the challenge here is a building that will be green,
is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation
when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China
it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 --
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,
that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,
with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,
to come from those other, larger countries out there --
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them
was that they were infected by something I call the
In a country of a billion people and some,
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,
a lab to prototype and refine a design process
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,
that they could go out and change the world.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke,
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child. "
the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic
and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,
in the future the children will give back to the city.
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --
unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,
the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,
which are based on the knowledge of the people.
by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,
and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,
which shows how much of this income has gone
that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
Is it that I analyze the data very well?
I must be entitled to this reward from society? "
that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --
because there was no line in my income tax return
those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --
So much so, that much of my work till that time
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,
by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,
if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma
dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
And one day -- I don't know what happened --
or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:
it must be shared with them in their language.
And I must tell you that after 20 years,
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me
and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences
that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,
You cannot be in favor of your own values,
Can you tell me where has it been taken from,
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,
because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
If this woman has to carry water on her head
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,
millions of women still carry water on their heads.

you know what the action is? The action is:
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.

So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.

can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,
That's the only space she could express her creativity.
on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
But to be able to give them high-quality output
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee
people who will be able to scale them up.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,
need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient,
I think we need a polycentric model of development,
where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,
point by point, with the supply that you're making.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
But if I had to get a match to match,
obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,
and yet, one can be able to fund them.
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is
that many times investors would ask this question --
as if the need of a community, which is only
and has those needs only located in those places,
has no legitimate right to get them for free
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale
people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,
and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people
in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office
where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.

It's not that a coconut fell on my head,
for her to take samples from a larger number of palms,
because otherwise she had to make a big platform
and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th:
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy
how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,
but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
India and China have the largest number of cycles.
The point is, none of us should be parochial,
none of us should be so nationalistic to believe
that all good ideas will come only from our country.
No, we have to have the humility to learn
from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:
and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out,
They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide
put a photograph of the innovator on the packing
it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
If you have an idea, send it back to us. "
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
that he could only make because there's also dark.
So this is how we normally would light our offices.
that tell us that the lights should be so much lux
because there is also darkness in that same building.
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said
when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner
of the quality of the building for the people.
that give us a better life in the built environment,
What it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.
but we should not forget that all energy on this planet
which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy,
just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.
but opens up to the good light from the sky.
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor,
but they could easily figure out where that comes from.
so these people have found a very intriguing solution.
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say --
as much as it is about lightness, of course,
As opposed to the first office that I showed you
this is a well-known office, which is the White Group.
They are in green energy consulting, or something like that.
because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.
and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work,
and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.
that is never boring and that is never dull,
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you.
which is the reason I bring him up now,
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person
Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did
and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive,"
and I will get back to that a little bit later.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds
Or it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment --
and creating accents that help you to get around.
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light
that really some play of the skyline of Hong Kong,
And we can only create these out of darkness.
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left,
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine,
where people are put in the sun to get better.
it is the yellow light that helps us the most,
which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep
and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on,
we can help people to relax, or to be alert,
Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better
So light is, of course, for social interaction also --
when we have to say something to each other.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
And I think this is the most shocking image
So at a global scale, it looks like this.
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here --
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be,
it would be something like this very inspiring image
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou,
How do people move through these new urban spaces?
they seem to be in a really interesting position
And of course, we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity
allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think,
and a new way of lighting the architectural environment
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works --
but I can have four of these on my finger,
so you would not to be able to really see them.
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it,
They created for me the biggest LED in the world
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger.
And I will very quickly show you how it works.
and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
And then when you add the lens to that,
you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light.
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities.
and create better environments that also benefit from darkness?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually.
so they really want to connect with it, like here?
that are very inspiring to be in and to be around?
Because to find a place like this today on Earth
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light
that we could actually ban also for animal life
And we discovered that, when we make those lights green,
we should start making the light out of darkness,
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
Where have they come from? Where are they going?
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense
We can do that in commercial spaces like this.
where you may see one or two stars and nothing else,
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light,
that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx
because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
from I guess three or four different companies on building seats,
I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,
it would be that from the time we started building this,
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,
I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,
but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America
the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;
it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,
in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,
because you can imagine what the roads look like
and a million of them urinating and doing other things,
and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,
or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together
with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,
I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --
that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,
and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city
and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,
and more and more people are moving to cities.
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people
into cities in the next decade and a half.
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,
have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied,
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,
or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
The fact is, the last mile is the problem,
and half the world now lives in dense cities.
between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,
but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world
is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,
is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
And again, I say that not to attack any industry,
I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,
and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour
an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
And we all love our cars, and I do.
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,
and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years
at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities
of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --
it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,
and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,
it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
And every one of those industries, by the way --
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,
it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,
but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,
but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,
right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,
cities that were architected and built for people --
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --
Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians
what we take for granted as we now go between cities?
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable
to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,
to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs
We thought it would be really neat to do that,
and one of the problems we really were worried about
is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,
and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
Or maybe we should be out in the street
in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,
as the first person we ever showed on the outside,
and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously. "
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments
that want their police officers back in the neighborhood
on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop
as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
We went out and we found some visionary people
with enough money to let us design and build these things,
and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
But if I could ask you to do one thing,
it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,
but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow
that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,
that can bring you everywhere you want to go,
and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us
about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,
and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,
a little old lady -- came by me --
and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --
and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,
then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,
and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,
and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,
she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,
she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"
she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,
"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things. "
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,
were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators
it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people
not to invade the most precious little bit of space left,
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,
then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,
and then the other eight feet -- it's --
and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,
and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults
aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --
that it's the older population that's going to worry.
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,
the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,
And they took it to Washington; they showed them;
watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,
like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,
in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
They start at the top of the technology food chain.
We've got to start building cities and human environments
where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles
without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --
because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --
we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --
But if you could put a pin in most cities,
and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,
you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,
you can't get to a cab or a subway.
We could change the way people allocate their resources,
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,
about the capability of this to have an impact,
where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
starting way back with Johnson & amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT,
8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --
because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,
if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,
which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,
as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,
you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,
it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --
25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,
turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,
with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,
then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,
and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,
it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water
from anything that comes into it to cool it.
So if we put this box on here in a few years,
which is something that many of you follow --
are something that we write about and need to know about.
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --
you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
We have to plan issues many months in advance;
we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,
nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,
but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made
during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,
or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,
they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations
is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,
to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,
or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense
of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;
we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies
are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends
that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"
but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --
at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --
for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology
and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
And these are the inflection points that tell you
what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,
and maybe how you can do something about it.
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,
if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --
you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,
but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this
which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s
and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,
it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units
started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,
20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
you have a reason to have a big-screen television;
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,
that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;
you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,
who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one
DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,
the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,
when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,
just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,
these four, as a way to kind of tell you
where each one of those technologies is in its development.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --
But I think that the implications of them approaching
these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,
because it's built on computers -- is falling in price
to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,
if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect
of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,
if you look at the correlation between these two,
as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat
goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO
believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,
you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --
and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:
you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;
it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,
but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;
they already have nearly four million registered users --
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional
if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,
and the speed, and the players in the industry.
It's going to look a little bit like that.
the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,
because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
And here you have just the number of songs
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,
but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored
on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding
in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
the one that's going to get them out of this.
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --
perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990
when it was more than two dollars a minute.
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
but then there was just so much fiber out there,
you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,
to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization
The force of India, and then China, and any other country
and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --
of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,
who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,
but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst
that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in,
you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,
On the one hand, we have people that say
the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented
they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,
with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy
where people make one, two, three dollars a day
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
to reach low income people in a sustainable way,
real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
alone in India make under a dollar a day.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed
had to be small enough that a farmer only had
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
And we helped him build a company, for profit,
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
over time we were able to start a company
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.

And I would submit that it's time to consider
who really have innovations, not only for their country,
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,
not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,
and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,
can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,
we also need to think about lifting those leaders
who can be role models for the rest of the world.
I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me
to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.

And he said it was the first dry season

And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations,
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors
But I think our generation also might be the first
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward
to dream and imagine what it will really take
to build a global economy that includes all of us,
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
and delivered tens of millions of services and products
to some of the poorest people on the planet.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,
from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage
Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know,
I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage,
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides,
since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs,
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack,
or break into, a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen,
and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,
is not typesetted on an old typewriter; it's on Word.
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
and I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,
changing the way we read news and consume media, and, you know,
these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands,
you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog,
That's all he does now, and this is something that
And then you have something like this, which is Interplast.
to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger.
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing,
the short story about my blog: it started in 2001. I was 23.
I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it,
but I missed writing. So, I started to write a blog
and I started to create things like these little stories.
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old,
and how I went to a YMCA camp -- Christian camp --
that I hid in a bunk. They couldn't find me.
They sent a search party, and I overheard people saying
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal --
but I could be famous to people on the Internet.
And I set a goal. I said, "I'm going to win an award,"
because I had never won an award in my entire life.
And I said, "I'm going to win this award --
And I won it. I reached all of these people,
and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday.
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money,
and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing,
And I said to my husband, I said, "Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
this is my husband, who is very hot --
he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo.
And those people who know me understood my joke.
This is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant:
And if he knew I was showing this right now --
I put this in today -- he would kill me.
But the thing was, I wrote this, and my friends read it,
and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about,
you know, wanting a stupid thing and being stupid. "
"Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?
You could take that money and buy your banjo.
I've been with him since I was 17 years old. We've never had a separate bank account.
I was like, "OK, what, who are these people?
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore,
And I did tell personal stories from time to then.
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
And I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet,
And I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life,"
because I wanted to give her a little memorial.
It's these sort of personal stories. You know, you read the blogs about politics,
or about media, and gossip and all these things.
These are out there, but it's more of the personal
You see Norman Rockwell. And you have art critics say,
And I think this is one of the most important things
and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs,
the history paintings about, you know, all biblical stories,
These are the blogs that interest me: the people who just tell stories.
One day it was normal; the next day it was hell.
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two...
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea;
a disturbing image, but just -- just so heartfelt.
and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
But then it gets better. Day 96 he goes home.
That's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine
Twenty-eight comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading,
he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son
and he is, I think, at his age level right now
because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
and we talked about all these sort of things
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution,
It's this record of who you are, your persona.
You have your Google search where you say, "Hey, what is Mena Trott?"
And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
and those are the records of people who are writing daily --
not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel,
Whenever I think about blogs I'm like, "Oh, we've got to reach all these people."
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people.
You know, we're getting into China, we want to be there,
but you know, there are so many people who won't
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because it's a --
and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff --
and I had to add this slide, because I knew that
the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow,
and she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
This is my mom. So, I have all of the people that I know of.
of the family that I know in terms of
I would spend hours looking at just the connections,
saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair;
This is not science, but this was enough for me
to be really so interested in how we have evolved
of another Grabowski -- that's my maiden name --
and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
This is all I have. I have a couple of
I have their date of birth, and their age,
and what they did in their household, if they spoke English,
and that's it. That's all I know of these people.
and then it's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side,
because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
And just doing this I spent time in the archives --
that's another thing why my husband's a saint --
I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there,
This is the only picture I have. And to think
of what we have the ability to do with our blogs;
talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories --
that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
And he's basically taking a picture of his family everyday
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is:
you see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100,
and now this is them today, or last year,
and that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
I wish that I would have this of my family.
who I was, so I do something that's very narcissistic:
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year --
Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience;
and they tell me, you know, "You haven't updated" --
I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated --
but this is something that's amazing, because I can go back to a day --
and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly.
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this --
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,
and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things.
It's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
and it's -- it's -- a pretty disturbing thing
means the most to me in all of what I'm doing.
And I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
her name was Emma, and she was a blogger
on our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester,
so she was there right when we opened --
and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service,
And she was writing one day, and, you know,
And her sister came on, and she said that
Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff
and it was a very hard day at the company.
this was one of those instances where I realized
she lived a life where she was talking about
But the big thing that really influenced us was,
her sister wrote to me, and she said, you know,
writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life
was probably the best thing that had happened to her,
and being able to talk to people, being able to share what was going on,
And that was amazing -- to be able to know
was something that she felt comfortable doing, and that
the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary,
that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs,
And -- and so I printed out her --
or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family,
and they passed it out at her memorial service,
they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life.
my call to action to all of you is:
you know, think about blogs, think about what they are,
think about what you've thought of them, and then
the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.
powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,
And yet, the type of fishing going on today,
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna --
50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
and everyone in the room knows what it looks like
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
what's the problem for all of us in the room.
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun
to really study our oceans in a deep way.
that's allowing us to see the Earth from space
Most of us from the ship -- even I --
look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,
and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,
So the story of our team, a dedicated team,
or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
and this is taking us into the ocean realm
we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,
We can see in their beauty of form and function,
And we can bring two million people a year
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University
but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --
so that we can actually work with the tuna
who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --
how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
work together to keep this animal out of the ocean
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging,
making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,
is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag
is we get away from having to have a human interaction
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
has given more to help us than any other community.
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started:
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,
this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,
and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --
generated by this decade and a half of tagging.
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side
that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --
they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --
are European tunas that go back to the Med.
On the hot spots -- the hope spots --
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,
I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,
these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
we were able to actually go in, in our project --
and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,
is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,
that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,
we can actually take up a salmon shark --
This is the cousin of the white shark --
put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution
on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones
and in will come a white shark, a curious critter
that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,
and there they are: the white sharks of California
going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:
in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,
put in the tags that actually have the sensors,
with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande
So what we can see on this moving ocean
is we can finally see where the predators are.
So this is just three years of data right here --
So what we're able to do with this information
in an area, shown here for the first time,
And then for sort of an encore from these animals,
that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race --
we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
that the shark knows is there on its path
can fill in that ocean that we can't see.
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue
And then finally -- to basically get the message home --
from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
That way we do away with a few internet myths.
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist,
they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"
Well most of my work that I work with
is really a little bit about methodologies of working
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.
So let me show you a little of that.
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,
and he asked me all sorts of questions --
"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips? "--
the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"
it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."
and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."
I had September 12th -- from 10: 00 a.m. to 10: 30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.
From 12: 00 p.m. to 3: 00 p.m., I taught my intro class,
3: 00 p.m. to 6: 00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records
"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,
so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
And if there were, I would have remembered that one. "
but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes
and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it. "
where I spent six months of my life --
By the way, you folks know that in the United States,
So I spent a lot of time in this building.
"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act
that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation? "
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph,
which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them --
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.
"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,
do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States? "
So at the end of six months of this
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,
give us a call -- we'll take care of it. "
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves. "
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
and the emails got longer and longer and longer...
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?
so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that,
but they'll give it to me on the plane.
These are the airports that I hang out in,
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data,
then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent
where you have to justify every moment of your existence,
you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
the last thing on my mind was "art project."
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?
this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them --
And I bought some crabs too right around there,
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland --
at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.
that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there,
that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,
because this is what I had to do with the FBI.
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.
I spend a lot of time on the road.
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,
and the FBI has seen all of them --
at least I trust they've seen all of them.
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all,
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California --
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.
So again, you have to do some detective work here.
At 1: 56 p.m. was this one. At 4: 59 p.m. was this one.
and it all goes straight up to my server,
They need to know where I'm doing my business,
this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon
in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.
is all bits and pieces and all this information.
If you go to my site, there's tons of things.
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,
So by me putting all this information out there,
what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.
So what do you do when everything is out there?
than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here
is, well, because no one else has access to it.
the information that the FBI has has no value,
we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,
So we're creating our own archives and so on.
And you know, some of my friends have always said,
"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?
is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by --
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.
I think they kind of like to look at art.
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"
but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
So how many hours of the day does that take?
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.
we don't really think about how long that's going to take.
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,
BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.
you'll see the last airport that I departed from.
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive
we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,
the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
These are small areas of England and Wales --
the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
it's the same as the World Bank has --
because it's easy to understand and you can download it,
And you see in the more equal countries on the left --
the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,
which I shall use over and over again in the data.
so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents,
what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
if you look at that measure of child well-being,
What all the data I've shown you so far says
and where we are in relation to each other
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries,
we repeated it all on the 50 American states --
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government
to allow us to compare rates of mental illness
with three times the level of mental illness of others.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing,
are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here --
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common
but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier
It's not just one or two things that go wrong,
The other really important point I want to make on this graph
they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
There are some states that do well through redistribution,
that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,
I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare
how people do in more and less equal countries
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths
according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
We show that on about five different sets of data
And that seems to be the general picture --
that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,
of the status competition that comes out of that
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff
that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,
that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well
is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees
is that we can improve the real quality of human life
but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so...
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house --
but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
and it comes with a little slip of paper
that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice
and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab
took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,
and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,
the ripples spread out and the fish run away.
But of course, then the ball hits the other side,
the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,"
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
they just give you as many o's as there are pages.
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant
the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
And if you look at the inside of the car --
I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,
this is me taking a picture while my son is driving --
and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long
and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,
I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air --
and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down
until just a few days or hours before the talk,
and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing --
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it --
"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here
I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy --
not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence --
you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done
because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,
like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration
or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level
and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;
it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control,
that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
and you can stay in that shower for hours --
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found
at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
but the way you use it is you lay it on its back,
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right --
the tea is to the right of this line.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there
and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it --
and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else --
except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,
no control over the -- doesn't see the senses,
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life --
but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention. "
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people --
"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,
against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
and the poor little chair has lost its ball
and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,
with their connotations and design, in all its forms,
and with so much and so many people working
on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,
I wanted to build an argument for primary education
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --
that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means
from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,
you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was
found a route into northern India from New Delhi
which, you know, which did not cross any big cities
or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,
and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
that for this particular route that I had taken,
the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,
or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire
to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,
they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,
and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class
every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,
probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration
was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,
as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,
and that sort of thing. It appears that way.
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,
you've been listening to all that in the morning --
it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,
where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,
would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,
but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,
you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,
if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,
the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,
and he said something which completely solves this problem.
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,
whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,
where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available
or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,
but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.
and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,
so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --
and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall
so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,
put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,
put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
To the right is this eight-year-old child who --
and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it
The last question is what everybody said, but you know,
I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall
can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,
this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,
where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall
was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;
he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad
and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes
to figure out that he was doing things to the television.
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click
by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,
and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,
like, children would come and see what's happening over here.
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
So we thought that this is what was happening:
to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet
So, it has to be the other way about.
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
where, for some reason, there was no English teacher,
so the children had not learned English at all.
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:
there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --
So when I came back there, I found these two kids,
eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
And as soon as they saw me they said,
"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
You know, how on earth did they know all this?
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
which talks only in English, so we had to learn English. "
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other
words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,
not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;
in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out
to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
India is a good place to do such an experiment in,
because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment
really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
I also had to check or invent an engineering design
which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,
so I needed different climates, for which India is also great,
because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --
the first thing that these children did was to find a website
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,
where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
So we had to solve all the problems we had
so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air
put at the right places to keep the machines running.
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,
that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,
So here was the power of what a group of children can do,
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.
who are advising him on what they should do.
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
where most of the time they are told, don't do this,
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
he would answer every question correctly on that topic.
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
It was that primary education can happen on its own,
or parts of it can happen on its own.
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was
the second bit that I wanted to tell you,
that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,
I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,
and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --
so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
These were areas where the children were clearly confused,
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;
But at this point in time, as far as science goes,
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --
it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,
but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,
and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,
and I have to take my wife with me
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,
and this was in fact relatively easy for me,
because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,
the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
And so I decided quite at an early age
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --
and my father denies this story to this day --
I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,
is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes
and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,
who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,
to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
we can talk about that later, if you wish --
to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times
I was a single British diplomat in New York City;
to the job that was waiting for me in London.
in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.
And I decided to take some time out from work.
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.
to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,
and helped to deliver me to the next stage.
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq
and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:
which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear
did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,
I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,
after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,
and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.
or my prime minister again with a smile on my face
and do what I used to do gladly for them.
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.
than I like actually standing on top of the cliff,
which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.
which is, "What do I do with my life?"
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
people who got to the top of my profession,
A lot of my friends were still in it.
all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,
to know that the police and the military --
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.
which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.
But one of the reasons that riot took place --
those riots, which went on for several days, took place --
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo
and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
And that kind of gave me the inspiration --
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy? "
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,
And it began when I flew back from London
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,
"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you? "
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers
depending on how you wish to define them --
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.
is going to be a new country within the next few years.
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,
I went to a party in the House of Lords,
but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into
I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
and me and my wife were moving back to New York.
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"
he worked for an innovation company called? What If!,
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;
and ancient institutions that have been there for generations
and do things the same way they've always done things.
tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at? What If!.
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.
who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,
is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.
That means the power of others things is rising.
they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.
then that means, who is left to deal with them,
who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.
or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,
and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,
it's actually provable in case after case after case.
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,
you have to look to yourself to do things.
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this:
is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --
people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.
and when I look back on my time at the Security Council
by what we were doing in the Security Council
you name them, we went to see them --
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,
which means your decisions will be more effective and durable. "
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.
if I'm going to spend the rest of my life
is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
that are on the agenda of the Security Council.
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York
to the members of the U. N. Security Council,
and for the members of the U.N. Security Council
any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,
from when I was a diplomat to what I am today,
and I think that outputs is what matters, not process,
to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,
"What can I do to produce that particular output?"
We like it. We like some parts of it.
Now I happen to make my living these days in television,
But a lot of people don't love it so much.
whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;
So why I believe that television has a conscience
social and emotional need states of our nation --
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power;
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?
tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?
I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.
over 80 percent of the U.S. 's most popular shows
and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data,
I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,
that make me feel much more positive about the world.
but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red --
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,
I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair
which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.
followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."
of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor --
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.

June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."

when she took on the idea of single parenthood.
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel
but I do know that I absolutely love this image.
if you think of yourself as a religious person.
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,
to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
and we reach for metaphors of up and down
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,
He quoted the words of all kinds of people
had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind
The world's many religions have found so many ways
showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom
and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.
So many books about war say the same thing,
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers
and wrote about the experience of men in battle.
for that which is real in me goes forward
JH: So what all of these cases have in common
is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,
in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
This idea that we move up was central in the writing
The lower level he called the level of the profane.
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
which is far more than the sum of its parts.
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred
they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
that we all felt, that brought us all together,
and this staircase takes us up from the profane level
and we feel as though we are better, nobler
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system --
that happens when the wires cross in the brain --
Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.
and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,
where did it come from, why do we have it.
who are always ready to aid and defend each other,
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,
but it's about to make a major comeback this year,
especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,
You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.
So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,
that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,
but as soon as you have a group of cooperators,
they're just going to get taken over by free-riders,
individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
Suppose we've got a group of little organisms --
they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what --
and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other,
as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,
and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,
and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.
and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
And so when a green interacts with a blue,
you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
why is it that the mitochondria in every cell
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why --
into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters
but now there's a new kind of player on the field
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive,
they came together around a hearth or a campfire,
they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,
they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments,
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,
Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.
And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase
from the experience of life as profane or ordinary
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,
and we all believe we're on the good team.
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.
Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.
is to find the staircase amid all the clutter
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.
They all want to find a cause or calling
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.
My office was on one half of the bedroom,
I realized I needed to find a space of my own.
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
to have to have carved out a space for his own. "
And I found that there was an historic precedence.
which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey
and see what guys were creating for themselves now.
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,
Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.
I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,
which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids
But some were for working, some were for playing,
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.
And so there is a good reason for this.
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
and he trains in this space. He trains other people.
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room
where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,
which is another sort of important part about a manspace.
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
So, as I came to the end of my journey,
I was really impressed by how personalized they were,
And I realized that's because the guys that I met
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
So if you don't have a space of your own,
I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
up till the -- pretty much, last few days,
I actually find them a lot more emotional --
you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions
and, you know, if you use a slide projector,
swing in from the back or the side, or up or down,
With that, let's get the first slide up here.
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
and God, I just -- I took a picture.
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
it was simply a gate that I was coming into.
I'm a big believer in the emotion of design,
what is the emotional response they get to the product,
to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.
and I think this for me is a real clear,
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
Take a look at the second door and see
O.K., which one would you park in front of?
is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece --
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
I would probably park in front of the other one.
that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of
come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,
made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,
and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective
than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.
The first book is called, "The End of Print,"
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,
he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice
that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,
And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
I think it's not the only ingredient in design,
in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition
it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,
but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,
"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why. "
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
And the more you try to think about it,
your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.
I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,
and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall
that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before,
But I decided I liked this contents page --
I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,
but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property, "
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,
they always form vivid images of the preceding world. "
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,
in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,
and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,
and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,
and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,
and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver,
where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence
and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
If you want to see this entire sequence --
how this whole ride was -- go to the website.
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment --
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all --
but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But --
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.
and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell --
that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
This was either an old product with new packaging,
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really,
to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
and put them up around bars and restaurants that night,
and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom...
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.
my background is in sociology; I had no design training,
and sometimes people say, well, that explains it --
because there's no product that I had to sell;
it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit,
and what I did was add type and people to the ad,
hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."
and turn it into a positive and not run from it.
I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with,
and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
And this is how the ad ran around the world.
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me --
nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies --
This is how the ad ran throughout the world;
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know...
And then as the agency explained to me, they said,
"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;
why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance? "
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;
could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles,
listen to the music, and try to interpret it.
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article --
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:
but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,
and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9 / 11.
chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture --
if that's the right -- it's not the right word --
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
There were a lot of orphans made this day,
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page
And this one I think is possibly the worst:
two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,
and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that --
they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk,
they found a note on their car that made them think
maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event --
There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,
but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders,
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,
because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,
you can now get a plate in the keyboard,
that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient
to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then...
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design,
this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.
What's next? What's next is going to be people.
the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
You have to utilize who you are in your work.
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,
from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,
and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way,
and I thought this was a great example of both.
that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,
and you get charged by this thing and you go,
oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk
about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,
who was a test pilot, and he told me that
when you signed up to become a test pilot,
they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance
But, you know, the government would make a plane;
they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make
And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
Why not put some of yourself into the work?
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,
And as teachers, after you get all the answers,
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this --
If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue --
And if you would, you've got a great job.
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
You're going to be dead a really long time.
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago
sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle --
and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,
at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools,
where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is
as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --
he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
But I was interested in another definition of technology.
Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,
I came up with a way of framing the question
that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
The question that I came up with was this question:
what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,
does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,
to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
what if we looked at the universe in our culture
through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
just as looking at an organism as only a gene
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,
if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,
I think we come back to life at some point.
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,
just to see what's on life. And if we did that
with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,
This is not on another planet. These are things
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen
I can't think of a single general principle of biology
that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
Every single thing that we can think of --
and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,
you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch
that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,
and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet
the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape
of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,
the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart
of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
But what I like about this is it shows that
every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
They've been around just as long and gone through
just the same kind of trial and error to get here.
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
and has a different way of finding out how to do life.
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,
what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth
have we ever been where we don't find life.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term,
that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
More and more of the inert matter of the globe
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
And actually, we have current data that does show
that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
One of the things we see about life is that it moves
from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means
that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
And again, my question is, what does technology want?
and hammers become more and more specific over time.
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,
and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
and count the number of species of technology in our household.
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex
is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,
that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see
towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,
you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
That its operations and how it works is so similar
that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
And so it would be sort of approximately up there,
coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,
and try to derive their genealogical history over time.
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,
those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet
that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out
that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,
that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important
that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,
"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts
for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked
for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog
and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --
I took a page that was actually more difficult than others
because lots of the pages are filled with things
that are still being made. But I took this page
and I said, how many of these things are still being made?
And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;
all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are --
you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,
brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife
made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,
what's important is that this information actually never died out.
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes
until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and
took what I could find, the examples in history
and then I tried to find out when they came back in,
because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,
the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,
is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing
and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --
we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,
that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,
in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,
and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe
were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,
and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
So as it expands and as things expand what we have
And those are the things that technology brings us.
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
And that's why we continue to grab technology --
because we want those things. Those things are good.
And each time we make a new opportunity place,
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine
Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented --
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born
whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
so that every person on the globe has the potential
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
I'm going to skip through some of the objections
because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be
how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that
maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,
maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity
is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
And so when I think about what technology wants,
I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this --
every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,
so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
That is the infinite game. And what technology is
is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
And so I think that we should embrace technology
because it is an essential part of our journey
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --
if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.
And I remember my first real contact with octopus
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately
became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:
that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,
and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks
I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals
and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,
the octopus would rise up and look at you
and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.
So I went right up to the front of the tank --
I was three or four inches from the front glass --
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,
and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,
and at that time I could actually focus that close;
now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank
and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,
because I was out and he had six left.
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
a funny thing happened on the way to the office,
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially
he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific
and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,
which had to be the worst movie ever made
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,
and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.
and you're going out into the field to film animals,
how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.
where you're allowed to spend large periods of time
between the time they named it and the time I arrived,
because I'm sure there were at least three trees
where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.
So our first challenge was to find these things,
But the idea is, we were there for a month
and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.
every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy
and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,
but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom
and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.
And I always wondered what happened under that web.
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,
you might as well pick one that's fairly common.
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.
If you ever really want to get away from it all
no one has ever seen, get in a sub.
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,
which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in
and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,
are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.
But we're just going to zip right past this area,
and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
some of which are tens of thousands of feet
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is
magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water
forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,
reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface
and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
You've got black smokers going all over the place
And out of the tops of these tube worms
between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,
which you think at the time has to be on another planet.
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;
But you go back to the same vent eight years later
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.
and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot...
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods. "
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,
and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.
are flowing into the bay from the golf course --
the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
and go and work on the other side of the island.
and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place,
crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;
She said that a small group of thoughtful people
one of the first questions that comes up is,
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming. "
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --
where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,
and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to...
and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
that's going on where they live, but up here we can.
like those people changed the health of that bay.
was to beseech us to do anything we could,
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"
"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,
some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.
Back in the '50s and' 60s, when I was growing up,
little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
There were plenty of role models all around us.
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,
but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,
I could draw, do what I wanted to do,
and not have to perform, not have to speak --
we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,
what the most important color in the world is.
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
We don't know what's going on half the time,
so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,
Now what if you put together women and humor?
we can bring a different voice to the table.
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
and I drew to try to bring my family together --
-- try to bring my family together with laughter.
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,
I realized there are not many women in cartooning.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,
so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons
to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about
that each culture has its different codes of behavior
and each woman has to deal with these same things
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer
through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
at an exponential rate in the last 200 years
so that by the second part of this century,
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,
So here's the problem: This is what we all want.
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050
Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York
look like this is what it's going to look like,
is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.
that I have in my head when I think about this problem.
the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --
how come that it's very hard to kill a city?
You could drop an atom bomb on a city,
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict
That is, you ask any generic question about this --
how many branches of a given size does a tree have,
And the idea is can we do the same for this?
and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.
And here it is for the growth of a rat,
also one of the reasons for its great resilience.
and what it is is their revenue versus their age --
how much energy you need per day to stay alive --
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system
which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.
is that, if you double the size of the organism,
is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.
if you plot it this way, looks like this.
So you tell me the size of a mammal,
I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it
And the reason for this is because of networks.
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction
plotted in the same way as the biology --
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.
but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,
whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --
has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.
that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.
The top one is wages as a function of size
is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
the more you have per capita, unlike biology --
higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,
And you can see, they all follow the same line.
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,
from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,
why a million people a week are gathering in cities.
Because they think that all those wonderful things --
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,
no matter where you are on the planet --
despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,
you had the slowing of the pace of life
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory
And in fact, if you compare it to data,
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons --
kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.
and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.
is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,
but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.
versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,
I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
and she needed to go there to get the information,
And he again had to travel to the school
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,
from teacher to student and then used in the world.
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
and it changed the way I interacted with information
between when I was a kid in high school
Right about the time that the Internet gets going
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
and whether or not the streets were done well,
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
But I knew that the kids would show up,
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
who singularly used his life to do something positive.
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
that when you ask kids to use their own voice
when you ask them and take the time to listen
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,
and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,
To ask them to always have the right answer
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
because of the issue of the idea of failure.
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some... "And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,
or whether or not it was what I could create.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --
in a landscape where we let go of the idea
that kids have to come to school to get the information,
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
is that, if we continue to look at education
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system
because we won't get there with a standardized test,
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,
there are words that we just don't want to hear.
for which there's relatively little that can be done.
And what I want to lay out for you today is
a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
and I'll come back to that theme a few times --
instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --
Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
But before doing that, what I'd like to do
is share my depression about the health care system
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is
to take care of our diseases as we get older.
versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
And you can basically see that the richer a country is,
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
If the average age of your population is 30,
then the average kind of disease that you have to treat
is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,
paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
when the reality of getting old looks like this?
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do
that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,
is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
and then treating the disease to cure the disease
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something
to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,
but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
is doing this in every organ system of the body,
So today's reality is that if we get sick,
and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
We need to learn to speak the body's language.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
In a child, before the age of about six months,
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
So to engage in that conversation with the body,
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices
that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these,
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
may contain all of the necessary factors and signals
if I take that material, which is a natural material
and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,
or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --
even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --
the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,
check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,
we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,
and has decided to die with what 's left of her body intact.
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,
that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --
I'll let you know when you can look again.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,
and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
who have used that material to heal their wounds.
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
can I take some cells along with the material,
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
and he peels it right out of the dish.
is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,
you're going to see the stem cells from the patient
that were removed at the beginning of the procedure
being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
And I'm standing up here because at one point
I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,
with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart
and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
We don't have time to go into all of those details,
and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,
along with a number of colleagues around the world.
which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated
with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,
who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn,
it's that we don't know how to treat it.
and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,
and we try and get the two to take.
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --
it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
deliver other things as well at the same time,
So let me finish up with some good news,
The good news is that this is happening today.
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice
is involved in trying to get this to happen.
A number of governments, and a number of regions,
have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,
at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece
of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year
and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
And at the end of a very testy meeting,
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --
these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
Thank you so very much for having me here today.
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
She has me here because she puts me in her show,
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
What are you allowed to say or not say?
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
I just think that to be here with all of you
literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the...
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,
otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,
but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
A\ and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --
it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,
the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB
and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise
and who also happen to be mothers like me.
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,
it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED
and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,
these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:
very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
It was like, you know, she was there in the class,
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,
talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate.
and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity
because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,
by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but --
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,
and first I want to tell you that I'm --
of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,
I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --
before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,
because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,
and they would always answer me back in English.
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
But I think he will change his mind soon.
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
And then at college, it's like she never came home.
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,
but I told my daughter that this is one exception --
that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,
But at first I did not know what to do.
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
I will share with you that it helps me to realize
society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones
for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,
I do like to make the point that we in global society,
we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,
which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide. "
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe
that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,
there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
And I know I've performed for some of your companies
but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.
and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,
so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,
or things I'm going to tell you I've done --
you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
And by the time I was an intern house officer,
I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing,
where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,
and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave
not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap
between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
How many people do you think are on that taxi?
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,
that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police
that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us
on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,
"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
you know that if you actually need critical care --
critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --
of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,
AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,
I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,
or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --
this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but
I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,
in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,
can you come home with me and do a mission? "
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,
that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave
and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
I think we all know. And several speakers before
and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?
There we go -- we're going on a mission.
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,
on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid
and I do believe in charity. They have their place,
but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,
you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,
"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,
so long as we use it and we move on.
But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
It looks like all these Americans are here and
yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --
he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,
but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,
it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,
you email them. But we were still using X-rays,
OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,
but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --
this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
You still get people who believe in it and they came.
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
would have been treated when she was a child.
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
We've done three. We're planning another one in July
in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,
but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --
because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
But how many did we do the first one? 12.
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care,
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:
"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --
-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing. "
Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,
gives them the tools they need to keep going. "
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,
you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,
and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,
because we make it our duty to find out
what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,
does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
if you can find a car that's still got a live battery
and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,
and what we will have in a few months, I hope,
is that ability to use this same renewable energy system
to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --
zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
These are the basic features of my device, or our device.
it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --
and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,
for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
There are too many of us outside and everybody,
just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --
if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,
it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions
that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,
looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.
You have to do it. Africans have to do it,
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk
about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
and we had a really good first year, and no call.
and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,
he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,
and they want to know what drives you a bit.
And what really drives me is a vision of the future
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
And when we heard a lot of the presentations
I think we all realized how far we have to go
And it's also something that resides in each of us,
are the two big calamities in the world today.
and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease
and all these evils that we see around us.
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,
because within each of us is the power to
equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger
and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,
except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
And so I used to read authors like James Michener
And their stories made the world seem a very small
And it struck me that if I could write stories
that were about this world as being small and interconnected,
that maybe I could get people interested in the issues
that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,
so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,
so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,
but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
But for a young man that made a real impression on me,
that one never knows how much time one really has.
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
One of those businesses was a computer rental business
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow
named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize
for this. This is a photo from the old days.
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me
But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs
to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
and is today one of the best known companies in the world.
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
But for me, personally, it was a real change.
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto
to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
And I wanted to figure out how I could
take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
He was the architect of the Great Society programs
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
to bet on these good people doing good things.
who are using business skills in a very leveraged way
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,
has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,
and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,
which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,
like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,
because not only are there good people doing good work,
but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,
that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid
and wanted to tell stories to get people involved
which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,
what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
And I thought about the films that inspired me,
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles
to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company
and I was met with a lot of encouragement.
"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,
who think you're going to come to this town and make movies. "
And then of course, there was the other adage.
is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business. "
Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions
with the vision to be a global media company
And we don't just want people to see our movies
and say, that was fun, and forget about it.
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the
Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,
there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron
And we released the film at the same time that
the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,
led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,
And then the movie about this person doing these things,
it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
I first saw Al do his slide show presentation
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
it became clear that it was much more urgent.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and
with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,
who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,
because we felt that we could get the message out there
far more quickly than having Al go around the world,
speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
And I really thought this was going to be
And so it was a great shock to all of us
and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
And we have 10 films in production right now,
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and
how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"
based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,
and, again, a story about a small group of individuals
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,
which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --
-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity
is that there's never one right way to make change.
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,
or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,
but every one of us is all of those things and more.
we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:
And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.

We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter
the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.

They used to get great apartments in the center of town,

It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role
Or as I like to call them, they are

You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,
because I felt like I wasn't going to be able
to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
But he explained to me that he was in a bind,
and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal
and star power that the conference was known for --
so I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions.
One -- I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
And luckily he agreed. And the theme, in two years,
It doesn't actually take pictures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper,
"Dear Sir, Good day, compliments of the day, and my best wishes
to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly,
but let it not be a surprise to you,
and, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find,
but their echoes sound louder. So I decided to contact you myself,
for you to assure me of safety and honesty,
if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone --
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment,
and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business,
he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars,
for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country,
before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out,
the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him,
my father insisted it was not in his possession,
and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
Meanwhile, my mother and I is the only person who knows about the fund
I quickly made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker,
who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,
although he did not know the real contents of the box.

I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal

three, receive the funds into your account in trust;
take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.
I mean -- no, I mean like in the TED sense?
like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there? Huh? Oh?
Yeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night.
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced
that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime,
they can actually predict what you are going to say next.
And I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."
But they said, "No, but don't show anyone," but they slipped up.
And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"
and my name, and it would tell me. And I have to tell you, right now,
this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site,
and we're going to test it out live today.
What was I going to say next? And "Ze Frank" -- that's me.
I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."

Needless to say, I was able to leave my job.
But some people refer to me more of -- as, like, an Internet guru or --
and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here,
because it's a little too deep for all of you, but --
it's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's --
Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.
Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day
from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity
to kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
It's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
You can kind of peer into other people's lives,
and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration
They said, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,
you should rock out with us, "and I said," Why wait? "
And they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,
but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked. "
between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure."
And I know what you're saying. You're saying, "Holy crap,
And I have to say that it's not all me this year.
I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past,
I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know.
And so, this year, Chris sent us a TED Conference simulator.
Which really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches,
and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
And I gotta say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff, though.
I'd -- just one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really --
like to thank all of you for being here.
"Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp..."
they say, "Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff,
"I'm trying." You know, I don't know if you're all aware of this,
I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent
on these things. So I decided to try my hand.
I figured it'd be popular with the young kids.
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.
"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
And this is great because, you know, for a quarter,
And Chris had said in an email that, you know,
I'm hoping it's going to do well this year.
So you can wait for the Second Coming --
So really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
and I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice --
I won't -- hold on. Making things, you know --
making things actually does give me a lot of joy.
It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of
a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,
and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project --
where you know you still have something to do,
but it's not finished, and you're not starting something --
And so, what I've done is, I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces to share that feeling
We're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software
people feel like they have to read the manual.
-- I try to create these very minimal activities
that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully --
whoa, I'm like -- on the page, but it doesn't exist.
Here I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack,"
Over 500 entries in three weeks, toilet paper fashion.
Again, people from all over the country doing --
Online drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them.
I think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons
and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process,
the process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in.
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,
and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure,
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,
or draw, you know, they draw penises and things like that.
So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
You can draw your simple stick figure, and then it collaborates
with you to create, sort of, like, a post-war German etching.
So you can -- in fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things
that look worse. So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling, and --
And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette
that was submitted to me. Here we are, very cool.
I mean this is incredible. This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this
I'm -- I'm dead serious here. I'm actually -- this is not a joke.
But, I think, it's a -- it's a really fun and wonderful thing.
So this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space,
which is -- it's basically a refurbished message board
None of the haikus were written by the same person,
you know, each line is contributed by a different person
I think that the "now tied up, tied down,
mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up. "
It's -- it's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,
if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is,
says, "Let's talk" -- that, like, chills you to the very core.
that allow people to get together, doing fun things.
and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key
to bringing up some of our bonding social capital
and I just want to show one last thing to you.
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference,
if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe
If we changed so much, something must have happened.
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,
that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze
those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
were moving around on four legs in the trees,
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,
We've got to go back to square one and start again. "
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,
relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,
that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse
where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
And at that time, it became set in stone:
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
the things that made us different from everybody else,
It's obvious that most of the things we think about
that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros
and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,
or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,
because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys
and that is when they are wading through water.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,
around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,
and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,
this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,
How do they react when I say these things?
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence
and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it. "
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.
And if you've got a scientific problem like that,
you can't solve it by holding a head count,
and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
And now we've got to look to the future.
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this! "
If you look back at the early years of the last century,
there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling
And I think the same thing will happen here.
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,
"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen,
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,
So we never hear the case put for it,
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
And if you hope to make progress in this profession,
and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it
"You must never be afraid to rock the boat."
You actually put action to the issues you care about.
One of the things I should probably tell you is,
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward
is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,
"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
and they set a context for having a conversation,
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with
So, how are you going to write your letter?
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time
and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
within three months the elected official will start calling you
when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,
with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,
but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
You may actually have to just get very blunt
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help."
They warn you or they try to attract you
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
You do a number of things: you're a vice president,
First of all, you send the original to the district office.
So, you send the copy to the main office.
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,
but a letter is actually one of the few times
I got this letter when I was first elected,
So when you do that, here's what I can promise:
You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances
And this is the way in which living materials
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
Now all this is -- and it's magic --
is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
in a way that can only be described as living.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,
which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,
you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells
and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,
would of course be the historic city of Venice.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible
has come up with a series of designs that show us
how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
What we need it to do is to be
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually
The protocells can actually move away from the light.
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
So that these don't just exist as one entity,
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology
on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture
is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
which means that this technology is just as appropriate
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions
I lost my best friend to a car accident.
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,
but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
and this is without a person in the loop;
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,
but I can do something for all the people who died.
are the number one cause of death for young people?
And do you realize that almost all of those
and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,
and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well.
the folks who were there first got a little concerned,
and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream,
The problem is that all over the west now
have claims for 50 to 100 times more water
along with the economic value that goes with it.
So it's not just about the number of people;
because you can lose your water right if you don't use it.
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts
and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.
which is that companies are starting to get concerned
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water,
they're trying to be really efficient with their water use,
but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana,
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water
it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.
but they still use millions of gallons of water.
So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned,
and they're looking for some way to address the problem.
So how can they address this remaining water footprint?
because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds --
and if they want to use that water right
he can protect the water from other users in the stream.
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream.
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate,
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water
and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
And you do that by measuring the relative activation

The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
So what has this got to do with business leadership?
they feel no need to inflate their own egos.
that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --
what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,
compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
I mean, you come to work in the morning,
who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --

So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.

fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds

in the subway in New York when you're reading,
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,
but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable
with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,
and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,
so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,
trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --
and the movie starts playing in my head already.
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces
it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition
is going to have the same effect on you.
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing...
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go
and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,
and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,
so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good --
And I keep it going, and I just got,
it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;
it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan
send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more
what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,
and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism
that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,
is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of
this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but --
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way
because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,
so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler
can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
And then they make a little tent for the baby.
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,
and it is miles away from the fancy furniture,
but still, it's part of my same field of passion.
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to
because it's great to work there. You really have power
in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,
and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA
in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,
which is to try and see what's going on in the world
and try to use that authority in order to make things better.
and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,
I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --
one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948
was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war
And then there was good design for very low price.
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about
pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design
in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels
at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these
beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.
where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for
the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top
of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,
and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,
current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --
is much more than the sum of its parts.
at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,
but I don't want to focus on my shows.
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that
there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
because the best way to design a successful object --
and also an object that we were missing before --
or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA
and it ended at the beginning of last year.
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
And then when 9 / 11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to
It also had... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;
design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest
and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --
it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart
it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit
will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately
functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,
like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor
so it disappears completely and you can hide away;
or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article
on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --
I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;
or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that
and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,
do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with
some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you --
because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside --
all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself
in the mirror and regain a sense of self.
and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker
and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,
and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time
I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,
and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of
design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,
smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,
as we become more and more wireless and impalpable,
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes
your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects
that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples
to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,
explain how the innovation in the military industry --
therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the
civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
and in the world you have to do without --
well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair
by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:
fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,
so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
But it surely is a very important moment for design,
because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing
technology making open-source possible also in the world of design,
which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,
is very much part of the work of so many designers.
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,
He's another young designer from France who's working --
and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies --
in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine
that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,
so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,
so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve
you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth
so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
The next show that I'm going to work on --
and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common --
the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --
and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design
as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,
and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send
because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
But I'm going to try and do something different,
and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,
and try and put a face to a lot of the issues
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,
just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
And this is typically what we've been talking about,
And some of you might be standing here thinking,
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever. '"
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,
but I know what it is to grow up without having money,
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,
and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,
they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,
which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
You know, someone would come in with a list
you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
and I now understand why they did what they did.
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,
And I was so disappointed, and I was like,
"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there. "
and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,
and because my father didn't have the right last name,
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,
And, you know, you must be joking if you think
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,
and who had done much, much worse than I did,
and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have
oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
And I was in the States at the time,
and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
they couldn't really tell us what was going on.
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious --
But what happened was that he had to be on medication
that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States
is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,
and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
while we try to figure out the money situation.
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --
imagine if this is all you know about me.
was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"
And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.
Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
And going back to the point I was trying to make,
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
is that it's not enough for us to criticize.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,
I could solve a lot of my family's problems.
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
I probably can win a prize for the most ways
and what we do is we track the performance
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
Everything else on there is a labor of love.
And basically, we started this because we were tired
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,
and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,
The other thing I want to urge you to do
I've had lots of conversations about things I think
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,
I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do? "
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,
in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,
it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,
my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,
so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,
which we don't normally get in the United States,
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"
we don't need another lawyer in the United States. "
And he tried to talk me out of it,
but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,
what I need to do to help you out. "
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"
because compared to what could have been in Kenya.
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up. "
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
a startup I co-founded with my doctor and engineer friends,
They're two big words, I don't know what they mean.
In fact, in 2009, I was even more clueless.
I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D.,
trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.
which is just a really beautiful, beautiful electric bike
at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab.
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai, my house,
This is a place where my friend, Abhishek Sen was interning.
He was out there in Parol delivering a baby.
He told me that there had been two deaths;
was that he said that this is entirely due
Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew --
that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal.
It is something which probably the cure is known.
So the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me.
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this.
My mom is a pediatrician, and I asked her.
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia.
and run it through a machine called a Coulter counter.
This is a $10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai.
It's also available here or in any part, I guess,
Also, that woman who was operating the machine, the technician,
I love to fix things. I wanted to fix this.
I got a friend of mine, an engineer, and three other doctors --
there will be 10 people who have lost their lives
She is really the center of the health care system.
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have.
so it would have adoption, it would not have medical waste,
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.
And thirdly, it had to be something which she could carry in her kit.
is it measures my hemoglobin, oxygen and pulse rate.
I put it on my finger, switch it on,
I'll explain a little bit about how it works.
You might have seen a little light inside of it.
In fact, there are three lights in there, three wavelengths of light.
and from understanding how much of it is transmitted,
how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed,
And this is something which is based on a principle
One of the things which my intern here, Pratesh, built
which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go.
There's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing.
I would love to tell you a little bit more about it.
what I believe is that the map behind of me
I'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world.
this is going to be the map of anemia.
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.
At what point did I think that was a good idea? "
It was a little different than what you usually do.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people. "
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college
And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was,
"Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?
"Are you really going to try to break in
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."
She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."
And then I looked at her and I said something
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending
about not being able to get my work out to the world,
there was a part of me that was working very hard
But I want to talk about what I've learned.
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.
so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome --
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here,
this is my 12th year doing this research --
I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country --
And so many of the calls went like this,
What would you like for me to talk about?
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector:
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk --
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store
and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear:
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life,
what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind,
before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic,
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.
because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
because when they teach those folks how to suture,
they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
So you know what I did? I made it. "
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"
You know what the big secret about TED is?
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
There's a great quote that saved me this past year
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
It is not the man who sits and points out
how the doer of deeds could have done things better
The credit goes to the man in the arena
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door,
and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this,"
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
I know those things that happened to you growing up.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough
or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO. "
And if we can quiet it down and walk in
we look up and the critic that we see
and, if you can talk it out of that one,
The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
if you did something that was hurtful to me,
would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"
How many of you would be willing to say that?
And here's what you even need to know more.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do
The other thing you need to know about shame
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris,
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold,
it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing,
said, "I love what you have to say about shame,
And he said, "Because you say to reach out,
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse
it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads,
because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else. "
You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man
I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman
I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
what do men in this country need to do
If we're going to find our way back to each other,
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy,
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle:
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena,
because I think I did it my whole life,
I'm going to go in there and kick some ass
And even if you got as perfect as you could
We want to be with you and across from you.
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.
We are a company in the field of automation,
So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors,
And if we now beat up and down...
So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion,
We have to turn it, go up and go down.
and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion,
Bruno Giussani: Markus, I think that we should fly it once more.
I've come here to share with you an experiment
of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,
what use do we have for a blind woman?
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,
but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
And the irony is that they don't need to be.
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,
and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
If we add to that the many of us here now
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
a vast majority of them for the poor people.
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
They feel they can train people all over the world,
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,
and none of it made any sense to us.
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,
and make it available in every corner of the world.
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is
and then determine what further testing should be done,
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,
many people like this would probably never get services,
and then they will stay for a day or two,
and then they are put back on the buses
to be taken back to where they came from,
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
The effect of this has been that, within the first year,
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,
And the second year went up to 75 percent.
So I think we have a process by which
and in this process of using technology, make sure
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
So, putting all this together, what really happened was
when it comes to quality, we have put in
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,
I think that has been a big savior, even now.
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away
while you're treating a large number of people for free.
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
But this really requires going beyond what we do,
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,
There was a time when we failed to negotiate
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
There are many where this paradigm can now play,
but I think probably one of the most challenging things
Now, how do you make people own the problem,
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
we identify with all that is in the world
on the one hand, there is the digital world
and no question, many things are happening there right now.
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there --
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
So the question is: how do we get the stuff over
If you look at the iPhone with its touch
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.
to where an object in our hand is heavy.
that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around,
So you move around the content on a display,
but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
"Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time;
you have your eyes free to see the city.
We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands.
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages --
but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --
For example, it can be thin in your pocket,
but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen --
"Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content.
And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat,
So, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want.
humans should get much more technical in the future;
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge
as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in
As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.
all one billion of them, are building the urban world,
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,
"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.
And they are helping each other solve these issues.
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,
easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.
but it performs services for the city at large.
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.
That's what cities do. That's how they create value,
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards
that live in this lively part of town on the left
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.
this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.
Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops
to send food to the new growing markets in town.
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,
or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.
The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.
And that will determine a lot of how we function.
maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of

old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,
Where do you think the action is going to be?
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all

Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:
because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.
or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,
And if we can eventually get good solar in space,
Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,
the amount of waste that would be added up
a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.

which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,
The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,
for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
and you compare it to the standard big iron
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.
Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
And so I would like to see the GNEP program,

And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.

Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.
we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.
I should say, it is more practical than people think.
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,

This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker

Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;
it's something we just kind of learned for this,
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today...
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different...
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?
BF: Good idea. Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,
it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous
with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips
in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,
I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
DH: All right, please stand here in front...
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
Have him hold your wrist so I can...
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not...
DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood...
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
Actually, we will take a second to prove --
this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the...
BF: This one's a little... Who's doing the lights? Could you
into my eyeballs? Is that possible? I can still see a little.
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.
DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this.
DH: There you go... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
What do you want me to do with it?
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year.
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.

Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.
not unlike millions of other species living beside us.
I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --
is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
We all have the power to change this trend
YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,
And the way we do this is we basically
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
And there is probably a better way to do this.
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells
than the standard approach done on the same patient.
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,
It may encourage more people to sign up to be
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,
to use in the future should you need it.
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome;
and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.
then what you see, of course, is this double helix structure --
the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters,
How many are there in the human genome? Three billion.
But in fact, if I were to place one base
on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen,
we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes --
And so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later,
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
That was all done on a machine that looks like this.
It costs about a dollar for each base --
So now what we do is we take a genome,
we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads,
and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is.
And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like,
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer,
So the price of a base, to sequence a base,
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998,
and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
the old way of sequencing, and here's all the new stuff.
you don't typically see lines that go up like that.
is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.
And we know this based on the machines that are being placed.
This is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.

She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.
So first, the way in which this woman was treated, in as little as 10 years,
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson,
who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
And he sequenced, he took skin cells, healthy skin,
and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them
And then he compared those two genomes in software,
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene,
you're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.
but it does have severe, profound if you will,

then they can go and get regular screens, and they can catch cancer early
Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins,
diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.
who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up,
and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching,
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery,
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced.
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR,
which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug,
Guys, this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing.
And at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.
The year after it's $100, give or take a year.
And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital

in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.
So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction
and that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death.
But the gene that regulates that down is broken.
And so this informs, among other things, of course,
a treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.
is that everybody in this room could live an extra five, 10, 20 years
unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet
Now look, as long as we continue to increase the population,
we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods,
and that's the only position that I'll take today.
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
And then more general versions of word processors came about.

And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in
and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.
Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can
to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.
It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.
Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps.
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral,
we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location
if it was just chance, or destiny, or what?
Now, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high,
he would tell us that our question was completely stupid.
These corals can be quite kind of mean, you see,
that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.
That he was in all these other locations as well,
Unlike us, a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared
And it tells us our reality is continually branching
It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around,
since we only ever get to experience one possibility.
In this setup, Schr? dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state
in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr? dinger is dead.
But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.
As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
This seems weird to us, because each of us
It's as if each of us, like Schr? dinger here, are a kind of coral
this is how the world works at tiny scales.
It can be summed up in a single sentence:
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry
Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles,
In this machine, a beam of protons and anti-protons
and brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.
with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
and, when it's operating, draws five times as much power
We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
These particles must have just as much mass and energy
as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton.
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
It's going to push this energy limit seven times
so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
let me describe the particles we already know of.
A lot of people in this room make a good living
But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino,
with no electric charge and a very tiny mass.
In contrast, the up-and-down quarks have very large masses,
and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties,
second and third generations, which have the same charges as the first
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles.
There is also a very weak force called, rather unimaginatively,
and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names --
Finally, there's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter
is that there's a different kind of charge associated
according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists,
is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.
is to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see.
And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility
Now, if we count up all these different particles
using their various spins and charges, there are 226.
That's a lot of particles to keep track of.
But if we plot them out according to their charges,
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined
to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one.
These particles also have anti-particles, which have opposite charges.
Now, it turns out the electric charge is actually
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge
and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space,
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge
and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.
The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction
in this diagram, the photons of electromagnetism remain massless
and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction
by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space.
We can include the strong force by spreading out
of the force particles in quarks along these directions.
The charges of all known particles can be plotted
to two dimensions like this so we can see them.
Whenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance
If a particle and an anti-particle collide, it creates a burst of energy
and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions.
At this point, anything can be created as long as it has
the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
For example, this weak force particle and its anti-particle
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron
and these three still add to zero total charge.
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty.
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions
to get a better look at the strong interaction,
In a strong interaction, a strong force particle, such as this one,
interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one,
to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one.
So they all split, and give a nice pattern
Right now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge
of how nature is built at the tiny scales
Some of these particles are at the very limit
of what we've been able to reach with experiments.
From this pattern, we already know the particle physics
of these tiny scales. The way the universe works
But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone,
and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
We want to find all the particles and forces
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles
that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric,
could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken --
similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern
In order to do this, we need to introduce new forces
When we introduce a new direction, we get to guess
and then we can rotate it in with the others.
If we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges
of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory
we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence
This unification model predicts the existence of these two
new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force,
Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions
and consider an odd fact about the matter particles:
have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.
then we can assign unique new charges to each particle.
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now
related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually
part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
This Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry
One small part of this E8 shape can be used
to describe the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity,
Together with quantum mechanics, the geometry of this shape
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space
As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns
And with a particular rotation, we can look down through this pattern
It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification,
we can see some holes where new particles are required
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be,
two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles
but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure
It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great
mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics
"Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze,
Its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures,
without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. "
I believe this to be true, and I've tried
Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff,
But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics
with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines
like the Large Hadron Collider, we may be able to see
whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern,
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern --
well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.
But predicting how nature works is a very risky game.
This theory and others like it are long shots.
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult
to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out.
But in science, if something isn't working, you have to
Now, the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness
in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance
I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.
I try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing --
This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing,
For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui,
Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents
how I managed to survive all that time without engaging
I'm going to let you in on that secret.
This was a view from my home office on Maui.
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views
That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times,
but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places
and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people.
So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.
Chris Anderson: I probably understood two percent of that,
but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb.
CA: That's right. The reason it's got a few people
at least excited is because, if you're right, it brings
So are you saying that we should think of the universe,
at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are,
I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale,
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds
to what we know about elementary particle physics --
And that's the one that I said we knew for certain.
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits
into this E8 pattern could be the rest of the picture.
And these patterns of points that I've shown for you
as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller
I know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time,
it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves
is what particle we see. So it would be --
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture.
GL: Well, as far as we know electrons are point particles,
so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory
is, all possibilities are expanding and developing at once.
And this is why I use the analogy to coral.
And in this way, the way that E8 comes in is
it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time.
And, as I said, the way the shape twists --
the directional along which way the shape is twisting
I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder, and I certainly
But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.
but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,
who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
but his argument was -- because he'd been searching
for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
about what those beings looked like from the fossils,
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --
that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same
in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,
you very often find people speculating about how early humans
may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
They are more like us than any other living creature,
and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees
are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,
although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,
sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
And we believe that this long period of childhood
is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
so we find that learning plays an ever more important role
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen
in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --
how these are passed from one generation to the next,
so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,
many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours
and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,
are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,
have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,
to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,
the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,
which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,
when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive? "
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives
of the people living in the villages around the park.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,
methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,
so that within two years they can again be productive.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
And we've got, as is the case around the world,
providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,
in the clear understanding that, all around the world,
We provide information about family planning and about HIV / AIDS.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,
instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people
coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --
and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --
it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,
they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,
so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
This is an area way outside the National Park,
And as these villages have a better standard of life,
between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,
so that once again, as the trees grow back,
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing
for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,
and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,
so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,
And the other problems -- in not only Africa,
but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --
attains the standard of living of the average European or American,
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,
arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,
that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.
"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,
talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,
I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems
could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues
that we're going to face in this century --
seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe
that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding
and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,
who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --
as the last of the trees are cut down.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect
the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,
and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
And these young people, when I talk to them,
or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,
"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them
and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,
and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world
can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,
we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
It depends on how old they are, and which country,
whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,
with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
three different kinds of project to make this a better world,
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
And woven throughout all of this is a message
of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,
in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,
between religions and between us and the natural world.
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
We not do have more than this one planet.
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa
one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,
and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,
because they're no longer helpless and depending on others
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,
which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:
from about one million, at the turn of the century,
to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.
Do we care about the planet for our children?
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,
we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
And choose to make these choices with the question,
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,
and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
that we must have if we care about the future.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --
which you don't need to because you have wood lots,
then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
can be given a second chance. That's my next book.
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,
and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:
So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,
or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,
sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation
out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
And we need some environmental role models as well,
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,
the young woman who's running this entire conference center,
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her
and see just one example of how young people,
when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,
of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense --
that may be relevant to help us make the right decision
and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year --
and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment
while I take out my phone and Google you? "
you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser,
and go to a website to try to decide
about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab
without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
which is still very much a work in process.
and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars
a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry,
and start using his hands to interact with the information
you could also paint your nails in different colors.
so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach,
and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab,
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago
or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
But the difference here is that you can use any surface,
So one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production
this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones
and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging --
than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy
of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report,"
the reason why we're really excited about this device
is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket
And, as he picks up a product the system can recognize
and give him the green light or an orange light.
is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it
If he picks up a book in the bookstore,
it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book
and can then see additional information about the book --
reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours
that gives him a little bit of additional information
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about
maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags,
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed,
And, if you need to know what the current time is
that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,
is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up. "
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
would be a very small drop in the bucket
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,
and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic
So I came together with a group of other people
of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,
then why don't we call it what it is.
about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers
And I know that I am doing a service
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle
and fill that up with water or filtered water,
I guess what I want to say to everybody here --
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water
that's been provided for you here at the conference,
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
What if it was from a source like this?
I talked a lot in the past about statistics,
and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
That's when I decided I had to do something.
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife.
I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone
that flow through here. And this is the water.
if we were in the middle of a flood zone
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
So I'm just going to put that in there.
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
So we're just going to put that in there as well.
just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,
and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
is make it sterile. How do we do that?
mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
and the two million kids that die every year,
that my son had been in the World Trade Center
We were afraid of what our country was going to do
and the U.S. government called for a death penalty
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger. "
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim,
to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
So that's why I decided to tell my story,
so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
For all the women, all the mothers that give life,
so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
So if I can save one of the young girls,
and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,
This is why I'm here in front of you.
starting with that day we had our very first meeting
and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country --
but I want to tell you how sorry I am
and I feel that if there is a crime,
But she reached out to us in that way,
and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
And what happened then is we all told our stories,
we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
is a woman, not only who could be so generous
from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
Who else can I meet that I don't know,
that we have to try to know other people, the other.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together
far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,
the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,
is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,
to live at just one of those moments in history
the established order of power is beginning to change
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today --
By the way, it happens about once every century.
You might argue that the last time it happened --
and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too --
was that when power passed from the old nations,
the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,
and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
And the first of these, the first two of these,
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,
which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
What's happening today is that the power that was encased,
held to accountability, held to the rule of law,
has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:
the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,
that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary
for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance --
that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,
and in which people may act free of constraint.
It's always suitable for those who have the most power
but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,
space not subject to the rule of law --
becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted --
but also by the things you don't want --
is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,
of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9 / 11
actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers
You see, our enemies also use this space --
the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters --
which is about destroying our systems and our ways.
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,
then it follows that one of the challenges of our time
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now
will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent
the more or less we are able to achieve that aim:
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
But when it comes to governance of the global space,
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,
we know now that we have to put together an institution
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
and we'll come back to it in a minute,
which is that if you bring the most powerful together
then what happens to the weak who are left out?
and we'll return to it in just a second.
that if you are to pass through these turbulent times
and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,
the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,
occurring in the other growing powers in the world.
this is not so much a shift from the West to the East;
but the context in which she holds her power
in which we have had a totally mono-polar world,
has to be referenced by its position to Washington --
the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up --
though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,
used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."
Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,
if we want to get things done in the world.
it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times
when the West has tried to do it themselves,
is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years --
I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire --
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,
the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund --
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle
are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,
serving under the U.N. command in the world today?
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business
with people with whom we do not share values,
but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.
of looking at the world that is now emerging.
because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,
in a way which has never been the case before,
is the idea of a nation state acting alone,
nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself
are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.
in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,
how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,
I have to speak to the Minister of Health
because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,
I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture
because food security is a threat to my security,
I have to speak to the Minister of Industry
is now a point of attack for our enemies --
I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs
who lives in that terraced house in that inner city
has a direct effect on what happens in my country --
as we in London saw in the 7 / 7 bombings.
It's no longer the case that the security of a country
is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.
constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution --
that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law
it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age,
the most important thing about what you can do
whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is --
in a way that has never been quite the same before,
then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.
that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;
if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;
my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.
because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East
is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,

The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the
we can come up with a de facto formula
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
And then bring a team of experts in there
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths
And the first myth is if you try really hard
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,

Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,
There is just too many things to go wrong.
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.
It's a little bit like the days when we all had
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,
We think the best way to get these missing years
is to look at the cultures around the world
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
And here we have this area where men live the longest,
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids
and a type of wine that has three times the level
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
And in the northern part of the main island,
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.
And they eat about eight times as much tofu
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,
they serve at the counter, put the food away,
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.
"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.
And she put her head back and she said,
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,
The only thing that they have in common are a set of
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,
they stop everything and they focus on their God,
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.

and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do

Those of you who know me know how passionate I am
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
and he said his dream was to travel into space.
but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,
you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space. "
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,
up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
We had about 20 people who made donations --
we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton
because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
and I come from a slightly different point of view.
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --
they both have very wonderful things going for them --
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,
because I don't want to look at me on the screen.
that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
They are things that describe beauty in a way
that is often only accessible if you understand the language
who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve
these are things that are really difficult to understand.
since I had my training as a medical illustrator --
who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --
I wanted to figure out a way to help people
by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty
embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized
and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup
where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
We don't want to do that to our students.
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,
a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I
how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --
that they could hang all of these facts on.
They could have a mental image of the cell
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,
that are made out of strings of amino acids.
They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out
how we could make this story into an animation
that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,
that will -- in addition to all the textual information,
would have an internalized view of what a cell really is
in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study
with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,
and so that they would be able to go on
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries
and to be able to find out, really, how life works.
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary, and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall, and they're picking up information from cells
that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside, where they can't see and sense.
But they get the information that causes them to stop,
causes them to internalize that they need to make
all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,
and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on, but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening.
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced.
It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years.
And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures -- these little walking machines, they're called kinesins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size.
But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
because all of these machines interact with each other.
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly, from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines, have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.
This little guy is called the kinesin, and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins
to wherever it's needed in the cell -- whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle, whether it's to build something or repair something.
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around, right now, inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
So no matter how lazy you feel, you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.
So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.
And think about some of the things that we're learning about cellular mechanics.
Once we figure out all that's going on --
and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --
we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live.
And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty.
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines, are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.
so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things.
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible.
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel.
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip.
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things.
living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person.
the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it.
And I had time to relax and to grieve.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills.
And it became impossible to park anywhere ---- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.
Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep.
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable.
I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat.
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night,
I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing.
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.
so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
But I felt out of control of my life.
And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away.
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
And when several of the homeless men realized that,
they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
Then the professor listened to my story and he said,
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression
the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"
while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,
or what their life situation is at any given time.
Three years ago I was living in a van
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
In my country, that was the case in 1974.
but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills, "
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,
but it covered only 20 percent of the country.
What do we do for the other 80 percent --
leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
the people they chose were the people we chose.
and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
throughout the country, in every village of the country.
So there we are. We went to the people
who were seen as the cause of the problem
and you can see boats with the women, selling things --
And then we decided, why not get to religion
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning
with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again. "
And the kids were doing it in school too.
the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us. "
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,
but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --
they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog. "
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.
And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm
because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.
and we had to stop doing a lot of good things
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --
And we gave every station half a minute extra
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,
that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.
In every country, every program, you need a symbol,
and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --
the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.
So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,
but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
And then it says here, with the American flag,
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --
in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,
So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
And then we decided to help people out of poverty,
now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
The money goes from the company into the village
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.
And we believe if you want to help the poor,
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.
we want to change the school as being underutilized
into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth
In the last 20 years I have published a few books,
but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,
when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
called me and said that I had been selected
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity
because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium
I was told that this was no laughing matter.
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,
cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,
can determine the result of a race or a game.
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.
That is what I need for my characters in my books:
who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:
three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.
who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that
having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,
and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
from one of the most beautiful women on earth.
we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,
and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --
by the way, the same music that starts here,
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,
holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos
A place where most men would love to be.
My husband is offended when I say this --
although I have explained to him that what we do in private
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world
We can call this place in Congo a death camp,
because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,
and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,
she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,
even when they hold a gun to her head.
and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart
who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.
I have worked with women and for women all my life.
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --
so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,
she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,
but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you
and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term,
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;
as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer
but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,
no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,
her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home
they own less than one percent of the world's assets.
They are paid less than men for the same work
if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable
It is a fact that giving women education, work,
her children and her family will be better off.
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
I can promise you that women working together --
can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings
except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,
has dared to show the paintings because the theme
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes
We need a critical number of women in positions of power,
and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves
It's one of the great questions of our time.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop
or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,
there is going to be food there waiting for us,
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London,
and that something similar has to happen every day
transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me --
it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil --
but few of us ever get to see them.
so that a third of the annual grain crop globally
And given that it takes three times as much grain --
to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,
that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,
it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,
we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
roughly in the same place and at the same time.
because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
that produced a food source that was large enough
And if we look at what those settlements were like,
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest,
gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,
and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,
because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,
just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:
Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,
we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets,
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,
London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,
both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830
you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this
and be unaware of where your food came from.
the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London,
it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed
by animals coming in on foot, and so on,
that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,
and really this marks the end of this process.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,
because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,
and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship,
Here we have food -- that used to be the center,
the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
We used to cook; now we just add water,
or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems
is that they've made the very thing they promised
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,
they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,
So what are we going to do about that?
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,
little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,
It even got built, but nothing to do with
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,
and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --
a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place,
food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a
plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities
But of course, that's not a great image either,
because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food
as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day
but to do it all day and every day,
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,
that this was so central to the religious life.
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.
is to build a global society, as I said,
And the religions that should be making a major contribution
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary. "
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room
And TED introduced me to a whole new way
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,
We don't have to fall in love with each other,
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff
and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know
that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"
while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,
spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.
so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,
but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,
came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,
so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for,
for many of the more technically minded people here,
or I could talk about something I really care about.
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design
in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,
in Rome as a student. It changed my life.
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,
I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,
but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,
and it's a place that is never far from my mind.
I try to do something in it or with it or for it.
I also make drawings to help people understand things.
Things that I want them to believe I understand.
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --
All different materials, all different styles, all different times,
drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.
is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through
of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
These are sketches of some of the little details.
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
the bits of light that come down between the buildings
that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of
compared to the map that you would normally expect to see
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when
if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;
maybe I should just try and do a little atlas
And here's a line of text that actually evolves
from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain
in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
Maybe that line of text could be a story
Maybe I should get away from this map completely,
and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome
and simply kick a soccer ball in the air --
which happens in so many of the squares in the city --
and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain
what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.
this is not the first thing that I tried to do
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.
from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.
walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail
some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions
so I could actually use it as a scale
that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.
or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler --
sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is,
but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon
and so on and so forth. If you were interested.
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,
she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --
Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.
or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,
as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around
the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure
which is really no more than a pile of quarters
high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced
to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view
and from her point of view -- looking in the hole,
moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building
as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.
around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,
of some of the domes of Rome, which would,
from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,
is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de 'Fiori,
which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket
and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,
which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,
and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.
which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.
that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible
that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,
so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off
through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city
and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,
but he's not due at work until about noon.
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city
disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,
which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides
because there's text on the bottom and text on the top,
one of which is upside down in this image.
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter
who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine
to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,
but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.
to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues
to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time
in which it finds itself, or we find it.
in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.
and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know
that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years,
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle
and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip,
but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;
and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,
and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase
and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth
And of course, he also solves his own problem.
All he has to do now, with a perfect table,
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough
to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,
so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius
and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher.
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here
that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,
I mean, you always peel one layer off another;
we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers --
and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to --
if I got you thinking about it the right way --
would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome
covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side
and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.
what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings
or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets
into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --
double foldout page -- which, if you were like me
reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.
and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.
And I've really not done anything much more complicated
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way,
if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,
and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.
And if I turn the book the other way,
we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
just a book that isn't open the whole way.
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside
and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.
and it grows and so on and so forth.
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,
So I went back to the notion of story,
which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people
to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome
and showed all the things that I like about Rome.
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,
the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting
and there's no way this pigeon can get home.
and it's going to have to find another place to live,
and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,
and we start with the tall ones and so on.
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;
but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.
So I kind of came up with this old guy
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --
and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --
and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him
and they carry him off over the walls of the city.
whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon
. That's really going to go a long way.
So anyway, I went through... And again, if packaging doesn't work
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me
to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman
who sends a message on a homing pigeon --
she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.
if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,
to try to convey what that sense would be like
these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:
it takes the scenic route, which was a device
that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese --
built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.
This is one of those things I show to my students
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.
there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,
there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,
just turn it around and look at it the other way.
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower --
and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona --
which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;
there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --
stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,
we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,
so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;
it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;
beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.
we see what he's working on is, in fact,
a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,
and the red line extends through all the sights.
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,
all you have to do is read these paragraphs.
what I believe is the current state of manufacturing,
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers --
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems,
then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment,
all of the complexity of what we want to build --
And we need to decode that into simple sequences --
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate,
allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy
to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects
that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on
You decode what you want to fold up into,
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 --
it rotates to that, checks if it got there
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing,
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space --
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
[0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains,
and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
And the first one, in fact, is something that
And that is that the planet Earth, or the solar system,
is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought --
and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship,
and inside is all we have, all we depend on.
And we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,
Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that
contrary to what was believed for most of human history,
human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet
which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
Now the first of those two things that everyone knows
is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place,
the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by
then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.
And they are. So let me start with the second one:
Typical. Well -- is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know,
and look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum --
-- and that's not typical of the universe at all.
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back,
and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --
all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that,
you'll see the sun, the solar system, and the stars and so on.
But that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies.
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back,
and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
And at this point we've come 100,000 light years from here.
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space.
What does a typical place in the universe look like?
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion
So can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
Well, not quite, not quite perfect -- you see, in intergalactic space
It's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you,
and that star were to explode as a supernova,
and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,
you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
That's how big and how dark the universe is.
And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event,
that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years.
And yet from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense
than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently
create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place.
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
Now how do we know about an environment that's so far away,
and so different, and so alien, from anything we're used to?
Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us -- is creating knowledge.
Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been --
I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars.
Which means things that look a bit like stars. But they're not stars.
And we know what they are. Billions of years ago, and billions of light years away,
the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of
back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of
Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down
when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,
but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later,
on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe,
and model, and predict, and explain, above all -- there's your reference
contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well,
Now that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough,
the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other
is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge.
So, the laws of physics have this special property.
That physical objects, as unlike each other as they could possibly be,
can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure
and to do it more and more so over time.
So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality.
the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe,
is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the
whole of the rest of physical reality. And so, far from being insignificant,
the fact that the laws of physics allow this, or even mandate that this can happen,
is one of the most important things about the physical world.
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment, in the form of us --
acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true,
but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that
it doesn't do it with any special physics. There's no special dispensation,
no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of
there's no known way of making a computer without matter.
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important,
to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.
And then thirdly, less tangible, but just as essential for the open-ended creation
We happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter
of the Earth for billions of years before that, and will continue to fall on for billions of years
afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences.
As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths
of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet.
Our location is saturated with evidence, and also with matter and energy.
for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply.
As I said, it's empty; it's cold; and it's dark out there. Or is it?
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as
our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards,
but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,
on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an
Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen
from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.
if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,
then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
And the same -- well, if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply,
because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence?
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses. But all you've got to do is
look out and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars, and planets.
In those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics, and learn the laws of physics.
and learn elementary particle physics, and chemistry, and so on.
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take
several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard --
but I never did like biology field trips much,
and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.
So in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended
creation of knowledge. Any such cube, anywhere in the universe,
could become the same kind of hub that we are,
if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations,
then so is almost every other environment. So is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth.
And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources, because they're plentiful,
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and I think ought to
-- make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable,
because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive
the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them.
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away, and we'll all be dead!
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things,
and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
Now I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in.
But I do agree with him about this. We can survive, and we can fail to survive.
But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time.
Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations
And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically our only hope
is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species,
namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,
our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.
So let me now apply this to a current controversy,
not because I want to advocate any particular solution,
but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming,
I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously
the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory,
Because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions
with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity
and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is,
then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,
merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it
probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
It was probably already too late in the 1970s,
when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions
were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die.
Now the lesson of that seems clear to me,
and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster,
and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,
then there's not going to be much argument, really.
can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,
but that's only if we know what to prevent.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature,
and with plans to live at the higher temperature --
and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist,
things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away,
and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem, or problems in general.
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right --
not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope,
So take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
And on the other one carve: "Problems are inevitable."
At the break, I was asked by several people
And this will be my only comment on it.
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is
how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:
was, by the end of this year, we might have
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,
but if you ever make it to the sea,
and so we decided to do something about it.
and we're in the process now of working our way
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,
and we collect different size organisms on different filters,
and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments
that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms
and use sunlight as the source of their energy
all of us are breathing in and out every day,
we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day
filtering on top of a building in New York City.
And we're in the process of sequencing all that
the warm water samples and the cold water samples,
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit
and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
including all of ours thus far from the expedition,
which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --
And we tried to put these into gene families
Are we just discovering new members of known families,
but every new sample we take in the environment
adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
So we made a map of all the genes
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this,
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored
or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,
was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,
and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,
that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,
injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,
that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles
a polio virus had been made a year before --
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,
and that's the notions that we have with biology.
and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,
and a special committee the U.S. government has set up
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind,
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,
but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,
on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
because we can vary the cassettes and the genes
The key is, how do you put all of the others?
that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
in outer space due to all our travel there.
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,
on this planet that are capable of doing that.
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,
Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;
and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field
we think we can design a robot to make
the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999
as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,
and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,
so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns
but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments
to work out what the risk and benefits to society are,
and the rules that scientific teams such as my own
and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available
operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,
so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company
The president has seen how those rules worked well.
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight
which is that, if we can give more choices to people,
But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,
takes away a choice that people in the economy want.
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming
So if you give just to one side or the other,
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,
for changing rules that get us out of traps.
And he says that if you want to see
the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,
look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,
It's not just that the rules are bad because
the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
So that if we want to create environments with good rules,
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,
effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --
a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
and cut China off from the rest of the world.
as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
as a percentage of average income in the United States.
In the '50s and' 60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue
to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.
which you can see on the edge of the outline here,
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where
to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
But, to get on a process of increasing income,
that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:
make the opportunity to go work with the market rules
available to the people who wanted to opt in there.
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.
that made the iPhone that many of you have,
in these places that people could opt in to,
that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
a move toward the market model for the entire economy.
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,
to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people
On the other hand, the nation is too big.
If you try to change the rules in the nation,
and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
with new rules that people can opt in to.
to get all of the benefits that we can have
when millions of us work together under good rules.
to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
who will come hire the people who move there first.
the residents who will come and live there permanently,
raise their children, get an education for their children,
We can go do it over and over again.
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
if we allow for the possibility of building cities
but no one is forced to live under it.
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders
we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:
to build, first a little enclave of the market model,
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships
we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,
a delegation of control from one country to another
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions
that come up when we start to think about these things,
can get in the way, can make us pull back,
and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,
both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
that he has the chance to do for Cuba
but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south
for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.
Allow a new city to be built up there.
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in
without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
They also totally get the idea that in some instances
they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --
the kind of investors who will come build the port,
if they do it along with a partner nation.
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
There are immense stretches of land like this --
land where hundreds of millions of people could live.
not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --
who will move to cities in the coming century --
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,
the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks
like most of the world is already built out.
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up
by the cities that three billion people now live in.
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle
you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents
take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
by building more cities that people can move to.
And if these are cities governed by good rules,
they can be cities where people are safe from crime,
where people have a chance to get a job.
is write some details that might go into this manual.
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,
and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be
one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
How would we write the treaty to do that?
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
You could use the gains on the value of the land
to pay for things like the police, the courts,
but the school system and the health care system too,
which make this a more attractive place to live,
makes this a place where people have higher incomes --
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone
and build it, and set up the basic rules,
in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,
and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down
but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things
there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,
even though there is so many people on earth,
and when they discover them, they share with us.
the rules that govern how we interact with each other;
that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,
don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --
the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
And most of them did so without using birth control.
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait
until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.
to try to discover what was different about those kids.
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.
all of us, divide the flow of your human experience
And the problem is that they can become biased,
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,
what other people are doing and what you're feeling.
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
So that their decisions are based on past memories.
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
For others it's not the past, it's not the present,
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --
past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.
And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,
a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.
who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices
because if you wait you're going to get two of them,
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:
curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --
reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,
by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,
and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:
a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,
to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to
there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --
but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot
about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,
which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken
in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories
that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition
and have been for the past two and a half years.
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,
show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,
showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,
simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan
get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface
with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,
gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,
especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore
a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,
and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,
which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
it might be raining, and you might be standing
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner.
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,
and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,
is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --
it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface
through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things
like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,
it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
this was an event that should have been celebrated
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,
and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words
a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,
that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,
the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
But still, there was no sign in our images,
or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,
showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,
and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,
until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
And then, only a week and a half ago,
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan
is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,
has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered
that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles
My team and I have examined images like this,
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred
not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --
and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,
and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,
and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,
may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn
from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.

And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter
And when you look at the news through that filter,
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
But the top story of this past year was the economy,
this particular recession is going to be old news.
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.

Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

So, as we speak, people are mapping the world
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
The challenge I face when I hear this question
is that often I have just returned from the Middle East
but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,
for what that actually looked like on the ground.
and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.

Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.

I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East
In the course of taking my film to villages

As it turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders

Every single person, every single organization on the planet
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act,
the way we communicate is from the outside in.
It's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.

Totally different right? You're ready to buy a computer from me.
All I did was reverse the order of the information.
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,
But, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products.
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat screen TVs.
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?
None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down,
what you see is the human brain is actually broken
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,
and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in,
yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information
we're talking directly to the part of the brain
and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making
And the best we can muster up is, "I don't know. It just doesn't feel right."
Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart,
Well, I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts
the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
But if you don't know why you do what you do,
and people respond to why you do what you do,
to vote for you, or buy something from you,
and want to be a part of what it is that you do.
Again, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;
the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,
but if you hire people who believe what you believe,
they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
And nowhere else is there a better example of this

Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop;
not a single person on the Wright brothers' team
and The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream
worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,
they would have to take five sets of parts,
and no one was there to even experience it.
We found out about it a few days later.
The day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit.
and I will improve upon your technology, "but he didn't.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

And they love to tell you, "Oh, it's about 10 percent," proudly.
Well, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.
We all have about 10 percent who just "get it."
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."
The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it
before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it?

how do we remember where we parked our car?
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron
And when it fires a little spike of electricity,
there's going to be a red dot and a click.
whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And it signals to the rest of the brain
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron
And if we record from lots of different neurons,
when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,
And some of these patients played a video game
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,
whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
where the rat or person is within its environment?
likes to fire sort of midway between the walls
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
whenever there's a wall close by to the south.
And if you put another wall inside the box,
that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --
So the cell on the left, you can see,
to a wall or a boundary to the east,
whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box
or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall
or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are,
And then, if we put them back in the environment,
generally they're quite good at putting a marker down
where they thought that flag or their car was.
we could change the shape and size of the environment
how where they think the flag had been changes
as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,
and then if you ask people where it was,
It's as if you remember where the flag was
by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells
and then you can get back to that location
so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
But we also know where we are through movement.
roughly what the heading direction is to go back.
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input
from a kind of cell called a grid cell.
And if you record from several grid cells --
each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,
and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly
and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,
from one of these cells to the next cell
the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,
of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain
according to whether we're running along these six directions
or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,
which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,
which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
And he can return to the location where he parked
by moving so as to find where it is
with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
we see it in a whole series of locations
when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,
like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,
of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
your memories could start by place cells activating each other
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,
so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
like how you remember or imagine or even think
of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
