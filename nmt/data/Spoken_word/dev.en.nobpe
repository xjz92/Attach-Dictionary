and you &apos;re like , man , I didn &apos;t really sleep very well .
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed , I laid down --
but you really don &apos;t go to sleep , you go towards sleep .
It just takes a while . You &apos;ve got to go through these phases and stuff ,
So how do we expect -- does anyone here expect someone to sleep well
if they &apos;re being interrupted all day at the office ?
How can we possibly expect people to do their job
if they &apos;re going to the office to be interrupted ?
That doesn &apos;t really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me .
So what are these interruptions that happen at the office
or you &apos;ve got your own couch , or whatever you want to do .
they &apos;ll tell you that they don &apos;t want their employees to work at home
&quot; Well , if I can &apos;t see the person , how do I know they &apos;re working ? &quot;
which is ridiculous , of course , but that &apos;s one of the excuses that managers give .
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .
It turns out that those aren &apos;t the things that are really distracting .
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV .
You decide when you want to turn something on .
You decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk .
At the office , most of the interruptions and distractions
that really cause people not to get work done
will often have you think that the real distractions at work
Some of you may work at places where you can &apos;t get to these certain sites .
I mean , is this China ? What the hell is going on here ?
and that &apos;s the problem , that &apos;s why people aren &apos;t getting work done ,
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes
or Twitter here and there , or YouTube here and there ?
The real problems are what I like to call
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .
And this is why things don &apos;t get done at work --
if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work --
like at home , or in a car , or on a plane ,
or late at night , or early in the morning --
You find a lot of other distractions , but you don &apos;t find managers and meetings .
So these are the things that you don &apos;t find elsewhere ,
That &apos;s pretty much what managers are for . They &apos;re for interrupting people .
so they have to make sure everyone else is doing the work , which is an interruption .
And we have a lot of managers in the world now ,
and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world now ,
and there &apos;s a lot of interruptions in the world now because of these managers .
They have to check in : &quot; Hey , how &apos;s it going ?
Show me what &apos;s up , &quot; and this sort of thing
and they keep interrupting you at the wrong time ,
while you &apos;re actually trying to do something they &apos;re paying you to do ,
But what &apos;s even worse is the thing that managers do most of all ,
and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees .
and it &apos;s an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people --
we &apos;re going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting .
Just , you &apos;ve got to stop doing what you &apos;re doing , so you can have this meeting . &quot;
I mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
All of a sudden you &apos;re telling them that they have to stop doing that
So they go into a meeting room , they get together ,
and they talk about stuff that doesn &apos;t really matter usually .
Meetings are places to go to talk about things you &apos;re supposed to be doing later .
So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting
Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting ,
but that &apos;s not true , unless there &apos;s only one person in that meeting .
If there are 10 people in the meeting , it &apos;s a 10-hour meeting ; it &apos;s not a one-hour meeting .
It &apos;s 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization
which probably should have been handled by two or three people
which is in increments of 15 minutes , or 30 minutes , or an hour .
You can &apos;t . I don &apos;t even know if you can .
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour .
And so we tend to fill these times up
So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today ,
what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work ,
so it &apos;s not the last resort , but it &apos;s the first resort ?
&quot; When I really want to get stuff done , I go to the office . &quot;
everything should be there for them to do their work ,
but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
I have three suggestions I &apos;ll share with you guys .
I have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- I &apos;ll make it really easy for you .
The first Thursday of the month -- just the afternoon --
nobody in the office can talk to each other .
is that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done
is when no one &apos;s bothering them , when no one &apos;s interrupting them .
And you can give someone -- giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time
is the best gift you can give anybody at work .
It &apos;s better than a new monitor . It &apos;s better than new software ,
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office
And if you try that , I think you &apos;ll find that you agree .
And maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
That &apos;s something that you &apos;ll find will really , really work .
tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings ,
and replace that with more passive models of communication ,
Now some people might say email is really distracting
but they &apos;re distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing .
You can quit the email app ; you can &apos;t quit your boss .
and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule , at your own time ,
when you &apos;re available , when you &apos;re ready to go again .
So you &apos;re going to be kind of going up and doing some work ,
and then you &apos;re going to come down from that work ,
and then maybe it &apos;s time to check that email , or check that I.M.
And there are very , very few things that are that urgent
that need to happen , that need to be answered right this second .
start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email
and other things that someone else can put away
and then get back to you on their own schedule .
is that , if you do have a meeting coming up ,
Today &apos;s Friday -- so Monday , usually people have meetings on Monday .
I mean just erase it from memory , it &apos;s gone .
And you &apos;ll find out that everything will be just fine .
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make
at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday ,
just forget about them , and things will be just fine .
People have a more open morning , they can actually think ,
and you &apos;ll find out that maybe all these things you thought you had to do ,
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys
and organizers and people who are in charge of other people
and giving people some more time to get some work done .
And I think it &apos;ll all pay off in the end .
and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways ,
And you know , to be honest , I &apos;ve been doing this for seven years ,
and I haven &apos;t got a clue what the future is going to be like .
and it &apos;s increasingly in places like India , China , Brazil , Africa .
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people .
About three billion people , by the end of this year ,
And it &apos;ll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .
we need to figure out what those people are about .
And that &apos;s , kind of , where I see what my job is
Our research often starts with a very simple question .
So I &apos;ll give you an example . What do you carry ?
If you think of everything in your life that you own ,
And of that stuff , what do you actually use ?
implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using
has some kind of spiritual , emotional or functional value .
people are willing to pay for stuff that has value , right ?
I go in people &apos;s bags . I look in people &apos;s pockets , purses .
I go in their homes . And we do this worldwide ,
and we follow them around town with video cameras .
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question ,
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff .
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are --
across cultures and across gender and across contexts --
And I &apos;m not saying this is a good thing , but this is a thing , right ?
I mean , I couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if I wanted to .
for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .
So why are these things so important in our lives ?
And it turns out , from our research , that it boils down to survival --
survival for us and survival for our loved ones .
So , keys provide an access to shelter and warmth --
And a mobile phone , it turns out , is a great recovery tool .
If you prefer this kind of Maslow &apos;s hierarchy of needs ,
Yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff ,
And what I mean by that is , you know ,
you can transcend space by simply making a voice call , right ?
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience ,
and someone else can pick it up at their convenience .
And this is fairly universally appreciated , it turns out ,
which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected .
But actually , you can do this kind of stuff with PCs .
And the mobile phone , in addition , is both personal --
and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it &apos;s convenient .
you can just go ahead and do it , right ?
But -- and it &apos;s a pretty big but -- we forget .
We &apos;re human , that &apos;s what we do . It &apos;s one of our features .
and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .
And that &apos;s that moment when you &apos;re walking out of a space ,
and you turn around , and quite often you tap your pockets .
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets .
And you turn around , and you look back into the space ,
And pretty much everyone does it at some point .
OK , the next thing is -- most of you , if you have a stable home life ,
and what I mean is that you don &apos;t travel all the time , and always in hotels ,
but most people have what we call a center of gravity .
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects .
And these things don &apos;t stay in the center of gravity ,
And that is , quite simply , to have nothing to remember .
OK , now , that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie , right ?
But is , in fact , about the art of delegation .
it &apos;s about understanding what you can delegate to technology
And it turns out , delegation -- if you want it to be --
apart from things like bodily functions , going to the toilet .
You can &apos;t ask someone to do that on your behalf .
you wouldn &apos;t pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf ,
So , let me give you an example of delegation in practice , right .
So this is -- probably the thing I &apos;m most passionate about
is the research that we &apos;ve been doing on illiteracy
So , the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures --
that there are almost 800 million people who can &apos;t read and write , worldwide .
And one of the things we were looking at is --
you need to be able to identify the person
It could be a phone number , it could be an e-mail address ,
And the fact is that millions of people do it .
Just from a design perspective , we didn &apos;t really understand how they did it ,
of the kind of research that we were doing .
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation .
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people ,
and this is from a study that we did in Uganda
about how people who are sharing devices , use those devices .
Sente is a word in Uganda that means money .
It has a second meaning , which is to send money as airtime . OK ?
So let &apos;s say , June , you &apos;re in a village , rural village .
I &apos;m sending money back , and it works like this .
So , in your village , there &apos;s one person in the village with a phone ,
And it &apos;s quite likely that they &apos;d have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk .
So what I do is , I buy a prepaid card like this .
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone ,
And I read out that number to them , and they use it to top up their phone .
and it &apos;s now being topped up in the village .
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission , and then you --
the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission ,
and passes the rest over to you in cash .
So the first is , it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone --
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure ,
because they &apos;re not wealthy enough to have bank accounts .
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal ,
I know I could never have designed something as elegant
and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this . OK ?
And , yes , there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending .
is , there &apos;s no central authority trying to control this .
So , it turns out the street is a never-ending source of
And OK , if you break one of these things here , you return it to the carrier .
I mean , that &apos;s buy three , get one free . That kind of thing .
If you go on the streets of India and China , you see this kind of stuff .
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks ,
and they fix it , and they put it back into circulation .
This is from a workbench in Jilin City , in China ,
and you can see people taking down a phone
There are training institutes where they &apos;re churning out people
it boils down to someone on the street with a small , flat surface ,
a screwdriver , a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads --
because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge .
And it &apos;s all about the social network of the knowledge , floating around .
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff ,
OK , for me the street just raises so many different questions .
Like , this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China .
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes .
And I know what you &apos;re asking -- did I test it ?
But I look at something like this , and I consider the implications
And we look at this and we think , well , how does that apply ,
for example , for the design of -- the lessons from this --
apply to the design of online services , future services in these markets ?
And I look at something like this , and honestly , you know ,
why would someone design underpants with a pocket , right ?
And I look at something like this and it makes me question ,
if we were to take all the functionality in things like this ,
And yes , this is quite trivial , but actually the lessons from this can apply to that
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers
This doesn &apos;t have house numbers . This has phone numbers .
So what does it mean when people &apos;s identity is mobile ?
When those extra three billion people &apos;s identity is mobile , it isn &apos;t fixed ?
And then I go to this picture here , which is the one that I started with .
You can see the chai being poured in the background .
And he &apos;s a , you know , incredibly poor teashop worker ,
For me , this kind of personifies this connected world ,
where everything is intertwined , and the dots are --
OK , the title of this presentation is &quot; Connections and Consequences , &quot;
and it &apos;s really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out
what it &apos;s going to be like when everyone on the planet
So , the first thing is the immediacy of ideas ,
but actually , the benchmark for a big idea is changing .
If you want a big idea , you need to embrace everyone on the planet ,
And what I mean by that is , as these become smaller ,
as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater --
these things quite simply move very quickly around the world .
And so the speed of the adoption of things
is just going to become that much more rapid ,
in a way that we just totally cannot conceive ,
The next thing is that , however we design this stuff --
the street will take it , and will figure out ways to innovate ,
the ability to transcend space and time , for example .
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate .
In ways that , despite our resources , they can do it better than us .
And if we &apos;re smart , we &apos;ll look at this stuff that &apos;s going on ,
and we &apos;ll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse
And the last thing is that -- actually , the direction of the conversation .
is really about embracing that and learning how to listen , essentially .
One way to change our genes is to make new ones ,
And what we &apos;re learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be ,
that you don &apos;t have to wait very long to see the benefits .
When you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more ,
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
But more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger .
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago
Some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries ,
nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle ,
so you age less quickly . Your skin doesn &apos;t wrinkle as much .
We &apos;ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left ,
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left ,
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression
of early prostate cancer and , by extension , breast cancer ,
We &apos;ve found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited
70 percent in the group that made these changes ,
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done
Now we &apos;re also about to publish a study --
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
and the different colors -- and along the side , on the right , are different genes .
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --
in effect , turning on the good genes , the disease-preventing genes ,
And so these findings I think are really very powerful ,
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe ,
are giving some people a sense of , &quot; Gosh , well , what can I do about it ? &quot;
Well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes --
they &apos;re a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes
we can actually change how our genes are expressed .
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things :
We &apos;re seeing , along with that proliferation of mobile devices ,
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability .
he said anything that &apos;s not using real stats is a lie --
is how we deal with this from a public standpoint .
And if you &apos;ve ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting &quot; chicken , &quot;
you &apos;re sitting there , looking at the person , waiting for them to look away ,
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him .
OK , the gentleman on the left is saying , &quot; Screw you ,
like &quot; Let me find somebody else I give a damn about . &quot;
Or what we call the &quot; sweet gravy , stop me before I kill again ! &quot;
What this is doing is , we find a --
and a fundamental human need -- which we &apos;ve been hearing about a lot , actually --
but it &apos;s the shared narratives that make us a culture .
almost anything that could come to me through this device . &quot;
than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
but the kiss that &apos;s being documented kind of looks like it sucks .
So , as we lose the context of our identity ,
that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative ,
The stories that we tell -- what we push out --
And so that &apos;s the request I have for everybody in this room .
that is going to create the new shared experience ,
which in fairness , kind of is forever by Hollywood standards --
and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done .
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s ,
and regretted it by the time they were 30 .
I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place --
and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight
on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street .
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares .
And then I went home that night , and I had an even larger emotional meltdown ,
And this was all actually quite shocking to me ,
But I had always felt like , look , you know ,
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now .
In other words , I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret ,
which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past
that we should always look forward and not backward ,
and that one of the noblest and best things we can do
is strive to live a life free of regrets .
And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first --
something we might all agree to sign onto ...
basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss
And as it happens , Shakespeare was onto something here ,
It &apos;s also , by the way , a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage .
in the face of even obviously very poor decisions .
So if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret ,
I think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
if we had done something different in the past .
It requires , first of all , agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place .
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice ,
and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward
and imagine how things would be playing out in our present .
And in fact , the more we have of either of these things --
that you &apos;re on your way to your best friend &apos;s wedding
and you &apos;re trying to get to the airport and you &apos;re stuck in terrible traffic ,
You &apos;re going to experience more regret in that situation
Well because , if you miss your flight by three minutes ,
&quot; I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel .
We feel regret when we think we are responsible
we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
But then finally , it occurred to some researchers to step back
Here &apos;s what the answers turn out to look like .
We wish we &apos;d taken better advantage of the education that we did have .
We wish we &apos;d chosen to study a different topic .
various decisions and choices about our sense of self
So in other words , we know most of what we know about regret
But it turns out , when you look overall at what people regret in life ,
you know what , our financial decisions don &apos;t even rank .
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets .
or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius ,
Odds are , you &apos;re not going to care in five years .
But for these things that we actually do really care about
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo ,
I mean , it &apos;s right up there with , &quot; I want my mommy ! &quot;
We &apos;re not trying to understand how the problem came about .
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night
from the part of us that made a decision we regret .
And we certainly don &apos;t have any empathy for that part --
the thing we consistently say is , &quot; I could have kicked myself . &quot;
is to basically take these first three components of regret
So it &apos;s not that I sat there in my bedroom that night ,
these are the four consistent defining components of regret .
But I want to suggest that there &apos;s also a fifth one .
after I got done kicking myself and so forth ,
much as travel insurance doesn &apos;t cover acts of God ,
probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy .
In point of fact , no insurance covers acts of idiocy .
And I think it &apos;s particularly painful for us now in the West
in the grips of what I sometimes think of
We think we can throw money at the problem
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists --
because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right .
that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos ,
and I &apos;m going to return to that point in a few minutes .
with which we experience these emotional components of regret
depending on the specific thing that we &apos;re feeling regretful about .
You can accidentally hit &quot; reply all &quot; to an email
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work .
Or you can have your last day at work .
and in the very worst case scenario , even their lives .
can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
So how are we supposed to live with this ?
that help us to make our peace with regret .
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret
Now in my case , this really wasn &apos;t a problem ,
because it &apos;s actually very easy to laugh at yourself
when you &apos;re 29 years old and you want your mommy
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion
It connects the poles of our lives back together ,
and it sends a little current of life back into us .
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret
And do you guys just want to see it ?
for the most part they like how it looks .
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t like how it looks .
I can guess what some of you are thinking .
are also not as ugly as you think they are .
And when I came and settled in New York afterward ,
some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time .
to somehow keep an eye on your own true north .
And what I loved about this image of the compass
was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .
But it turns out , it doesn &apos;t remind me of the thing I thought it would ;
of the most important lesson regret can teach us ,
which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us .
And ironically , I think it &apos;s probably the single most important thing
I possibly could have tattooed onto my body --
and we don &apos;t want to hurt them or lose them ,
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them .
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo
and that I want to leave you with today
It reminds us that we know we can do better .
I thought in getting up to my TED wish
I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do
and how it fits with what they try to do .
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent ,
half the world &apos;s people still living on less than two dollars a day ;
a billion people with no access to clean water ;
two and a half billion no access to sanitation ;
one in four deaths every year from AIDS , TB , malaria
and the variety of infections associated with dirty water --
80 percent of them under five years of age .
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .
In the United States , since 2001 we &apos;ve had five years of economic growth ,
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families
dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent .
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent .
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --
which is why we &apos;re all here in Northern California doing what we do
for a living , enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal .
weapons of mass destruction , the spread of global disease
and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren &apos;t not so many years ago .
And perhaps most important of all , it is unsustainable
because of climate change , resource depletion and species destruction .
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter
it is a world that moves away from unequal , unstable , unsustainable
interdependence to integrated communities -- locally , nationally and globally --
a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago ,
I think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9 / 11,
I think the thing that troubled the British most
was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens
whose religious and political identities were more important to them
than the people they grew up with , went to school with ,
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century .
Into this mix , people like us , who are not in public office ,
have more power to do good than at any time in history ,
live under governments they voted in and can vote out .
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion .
people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money
that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .
When the tsunami hit South Asia , the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars .
And thirdly , because of the rise of non-governmental organizations .
to affect the lives of our fellow human beings .
None in India . There are now at least a half a million active .
None in China . There are now 250,000 registered with the government ,
probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons .
When I organized my foundation , and I thought about the world as it is
and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation ,
and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life
that would help to alleviate poverty , fight disease , combat climate change ,
bridge the religious , racial and other divides that torment the world ,
but to do it in a way that would either use
whatever particular skills we could put together in our group
to change the way some public good function was performed
so that it would sweep across the world more .
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs .
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort ,
and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I &apos;ll make tonight ,
Ira Magaziner , is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he &apos;s done .
When I got out of office and was asked to work , first in the Caribbean ,
to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis ,
generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year .
you could get them at a little under 400 dollars .
The first country we went to work in , the Bahamas ,
that they were buying this medicine through two agents
And all of a sudden , they could save seven times as many lives
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines ,
and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy ,
were being sold on a high-margin , low-volume , uncertain-payment basis .
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations
and the supply chain , and went to a low-margin , high-volume ,
to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers
to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy .
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
And pretty soon , the average price was 192 dollars .
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars .
because nobody could afford to buy any of it .
Then , the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax
That children &apos;s medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year .
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives
of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive
are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose , treat and care
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America .
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals
with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric
and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world ,
somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
And that is now what we &apos;re trying to do ,
and working with this large cities group to fight climate change ,
to negotiate huge , big , volume deals that will enable cities
which generate 75 percent of the world &apos;s greenhouse gases ,
And this whole discussion as if it &apos;s some sort of economic burden ,
I think it &apos;s a bird &apos;s nest on the ground .
but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly .
For those of you who saw &quot; An Inconvenient Truth , &quot;
the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one ,
if we don &apos;t do anything , here &apos;s where they could go .
of things we can do to change the trajectory .
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
Now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
It has been my experience in working in developing countries
that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say ,
well , we can &apos;t do this , that or the other thing because of corruption --
I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption ,
We now have the money , given these low prices , to distribute
AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach .
Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work ,
and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them .
The systems are not there to reach the people .
working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --
but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --
is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area
that can be used to deal with AIDS , TB , malaria , other infectious diseases ,
maternal and child health , and a whole range of health issues
poor people are grappling with in the developing world ,
that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda ,
and then will be a model that could literally
be implemented in any other poor country in the world .
And the test is : one , will it do the job ?
And two , will it do it at a price
that will enable the country to sustain a health care system
the more convinced I am that we have to --
break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight .
however many obstacles you have faced in your life ,
there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted
who has done the best job of this in the health care area ,
of building a system in a very poor area , is Dr. Paul Farmer ,
who , many of you know , has worked for now 20 years with his group ,
Partners in Health , primarily in Haiti where he started ,
As poor as Haiti is , in the area where Farmer &apos;s clinic is active --
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --
since 1988 , they have not lost one person to tuberculosis , not one .
And they &apos;ve achieved a lot of other amazing health results .
on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem ,
because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day .
So I rang up , asked Paul Farmer if he would help .
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti
and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country ,
number one , it would be a wonderful thing for a country
that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years ,
and number two , we would have something that could then be adapted
to any other poor country anywhere in the world .
And we &apos;re working in an area called Southern Kayonza ,
which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda ,
with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people .
We &apos;re essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti :
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed
who work on bringing about health education , clean water and sanitation ,
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care
if they have problems of the severity that require it .
The procedures that make this work have been perfected ,
as I said , by Paul Farmer and his team
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years .
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda .
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government
has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country ,
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about our team because it &apos;s indicative of what we do .
working in our AIDS program , some of them for nothing --
And then we have others working in these other related programs .
was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble ,
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work .
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s .
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life .
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country .
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it .
When we came to this rural area , 45 percent of the children under the age of five
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five .
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis .
Within the first 18 months , the following things happened :
we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS .
That &apos;s 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area .
Listen to this : less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .
That &apos;s lower than the figure in the United States .
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs .
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system .
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000 . I meant 40,000 .
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --
in just 18 months , up from zero when we started .
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow .
We &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide
that we have renovated along with four other clinics ,
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home .
because we &apos;ve implemented Paul Farmer &apos;s model , using community health workers ,
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years .
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP
on health care , except for the United States , we spend 16 --
We &apos;re now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up .
We &apos;re also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing :
to save as many lives as quickly as we can ,
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world .
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors , nurses ,
health administration and community health workers throughout the country ,
to set up the information technology , the solar energy ,
we will take down the need for outside assistance
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build
a high-quality rural health system in a poor country , Rwanda ,
and indeed , for any poor country anywhere in the world .
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world
a place we &apos;d all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in .
It has been an honor for me , particularly , to work in Rwanda
where we also have a major economic development project
in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter , the Scottish philanthropist ,
where last year we , using the same thing with AIDS drugs ,
cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent
These people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me ,
helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other .
We &apos;re undoing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
I &apos;m doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid
to the 35 percent of the people that have no access ,
but to do it with clean energy . To have responsible reforestation projects ,
the Rwandans , interestingly enough , have been quite good , Mr. Wilson ,
There &apos;s a couple of guys from southern farming families --
the first thing I did when I went out to this place
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt
We have a chance here to prove that a country
and provide comprehensive , quality health care with minimal outside help .
I am grateful for this prize , and I will use it to that end .
We could use some more help to do this ,
but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system
in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income ,
one that could save hundreds of millions of lives
over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth .
It &apos;s worth a try and I believe it would succeed .
that I was the little kid in the village
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali ,
It was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
and even if part of what he says is true ,
they &apos;re not going to have the life that I had .
that I would spend the rest of my life
And here it is : it &apos;s called the Green School .
Would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
We pay the bill at the end of the month ,
but the people that are really going to pay the bill
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks ,
and then they signed up for two extra courses .
We &apos;re on the grid . We &apos;re not proud of it .
is the second vortex to be built in the world ,
and mixing it with a huge amount of water --
and nobody at the school wanted to know about them ,
And they work . People use them . People are okay .
we took old automobile windshields , put paper behind them
I met a father the other day ; he looked a little crazed .
He said , &quot; I &apos;ve been on an airplane for 24 hours . &quot;
He said , &quot; I had a dream once about a green school ,
and I saw a picture of this green school ,
so their kids can walk to school on the paths .
The sidewalks are gravel . They flood when it rains ,
they found out the fence was made out of tapioca .
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen ,
We manage to keep the garden that was there
running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms .
but they know something that few people know in a rice culture .
they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it .
and it &apos;s not a normal lunch . There &apos;s no gas .
It &apos;s a school where you do learn reading --
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields .
We &apos;ve done a lot of outrageous things in our lives ,
and we said , okay , local , what does &quot; local &quot; mean ?
that 20 percent of the population of the school
because these kids will be Bali &apos;s next green leaders .
It comes out of the ground like a train .
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months
When the architects came , they brought us these things ,
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do ,
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world ,
Green School is a model we built for the world .
And you just have to follow these simple , simple rules :
Roger Ebert : These are my words , but this is not my voice .
I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak .
In those days , I was living in a fool &apos;s paradise .
took away my ability to speak , eat or drink ,
in which a computer does some of my living for me .
we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED .
I used to be able to talk like that .
and how the act of speaking or not speaking
as to force the birth of a new person
However , I &apos;ve found that listening to a computer voice
So I &apos;ve decided to recruit some of my TED friends
Chaz Ebert : It was Chaz who stood by my side
in time to return to my movie review show ,
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg
Two weeks later , I was ready to return home .
Thank God I was still in my hospital room
that if that song hadn &apos;t played for so long ,
I might have already been in the car , on the way home ,
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath
and nobody had to try to read my handwriting .
I tried out various computer voices that were available online ,
and for several months I had a British accent ,
When it saw a period , it knew how to make a sentence
sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air .
There are all sorts of html codes you can use
to control the timing and inflection of computer voices ,
For me , they share a fundamental problem : they &apos;re too slow .
I need to type fast and to jump right in .
to wait for me to fool around with the codes
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?
How does that affect who you are as a person ?
How did I feel not being able to speak ?
I &apos;ve become uncomfortable when I &apos;m separated from my laptop .
Even then , I &apos;m aware that most people have little patience
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice
to hear my own voice coming from a computer .
There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own .
But I decided then to just give it a try .
All of their voices had been made by a speaker
But they were willing to give it a try .
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice ,
There was a reason for that ; it was me .
The tapes from my TV show weren &apos;t very useful
because there were too many other kinds of audio involved --
movie soundtracks , for example , or Gene Siskel arguing with me --
I &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
These are a few of the comments I recorded for use
when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program .
Roger 2.0 : Oprah , I can &apos;t tell you how great it is
This is the first version of my computer voice .
When I read something , it will read in my voice .
The voice was created by a company in Scotland
that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken
This is the first voice they &apos;ve created for an individual .
There are several very good voices available for computers ,
that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .
Roger Ebert : As you can hear , it sounds like me ,
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice ,
and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex .
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations
John Hunter : All my life I was a motormouth .
I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story
titled &quot; I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream . &quot;
For almost all of its millions and billions of years ,
For almost all the years of life on Earth ,
that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world ,
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school ,
I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois
which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC .
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished .
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago ,
It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana ,
of much of the virtual , online universe we occupy today .
But I &apos;m not here from the Chamber of Commerce .
I &apos;m here as a man who wants to communicate .
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s
when one of the first Atech systems was installed
And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards
that they &apos;d better install some phone lines for Internet connections ,
&quot; The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival
with a portable computer the size of a suitcase
Indeed , I am lucky to live in history at all ,
Now we live in the age of the Internet ,
which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
I was left with a little less flesh and bone .
and it &apos;s my shoulders that slow up my walk .
It is human nature to look at someone like me
and assume I have lost some of my marbles .
There are people who don &apos;t want to make eye contact .
You should never let your wife read something like this .
And on the Web , my real voice finds expression .
All of these people are saying , in one way or another ,
I have much to make me happy and relieved .
If I were in this condition at any point
RE : Wait . I have one more thing to add .
You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test .
If the judge can &apos;t tell the machine apart from the human ,
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test .
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke
and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman ,
I閳ユ獓 like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --
those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid .
And , of course , I &apos;m dedicating it also to my grandmother ,
whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles ,
especially for me when I was an activist , and being harassed by the police .
You will recall that in 1976 , June 16 , the students of South Africa boycotted
the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor ,
And the students wanted to speak to the government ,
And I was very young then . I think I was 11 years ,
when I know that maybe the police might be coming
around the ninth or 10th of June or so .
And indeed , the police came -- because they閳ユ獟l just arrest us
and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like , after the 20th or so .
So it was on the 10th of June , and they came , and they surrounded the house ,
and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house ,
And she said to them , &quot; Vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
I &apos;m tired of you having to come here , harassing us ,
while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes .
He is here , and you &apos;re not going to take him .
I &apos;ve got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here , gets it . &quot;
? Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama . ?
? Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory , ?
? I know the truth in your smile , ?
? piercing through the gloom of my ignorance . ?
? Oh , there is a mama lying down sleeping ?
? you &apos;re very ill and your heart crying . ?
? Wondering , wondering , wondering , wondering where is this world coming to . ?
? Is it right the children have to fend for themselves ? No , no , no , no , no. no . ?
? Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady &apos;s head ? ?
? Thula Mama Mama , Thula Mama . Thula Mama Mama . ?
? Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama Mama , Thula Mama ?
? Tomorrow it &apos;s going to be better to climb , Mama . ?
? Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour . ?
? And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing , ?
? baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby . ?
? Should I now stop singing of love , ?
? now that my memory &apos;s surrounded by blood ? ?
? Sister , why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer ? ?
? So who are they who says , no more love poems now ? ?
? I want to sing a song of love ?
? for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant ?
? and still gave birth to a healthy child . ?
? Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile ?
? that will ignite my love song , my song of life , ?
? my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , ?
? my song of life , my song of love , my song of life . ?
? Ooh , I閳ユ獫e not tried to run away from song , ?
? I hear a persistent voice , more powerful than the enemy bombs . ?
? The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood . ?
? My song of love and my song of life , my song of love , ?
? my song of life , my song of love , ?
? my song of life , my song of love -- I want everybody to sing with me -- ?
? my song of life , my song of love , my song of life -- everybody sing with me -- ?
? my song of life , my song of love -- I can &apos;t hear you -- ?
? my song of love , my song of life -- you can do better -- ?
? my song of life , my song of love -- keep singing , keep singing -- ?
? my song of love , my song of life , yes , my song of love -- ?
? you can do better than that -- ?
? my song of life , yes , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love -- ?
? keep singing , keep singing , keep singing -- my song of love . ?
? Oh yeah . My song of -- a love song , my song of life . Sing . A love song , my song of life . Sing . ?
? Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . ?
? Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . ?
Readers don &apos;t want to pay for yesterday &apos;s news , and advertisers follow them .
is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday .
So , should we rather ask , &quot; Can anything save newspapers ? &quot;
or niche , for some smaller groups like business --
because later we listen to radio in a car ,
check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV .
I think there is no reason , no practical reason
started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc .
After a few years , they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe .
with no visual culture , no budgets for visuals --
in many places there were not even art directors .
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
Before , I was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once ,
&quot; What ? There &apos;s nothing to design there . It &apos;s just boring letters &quot;
And she was right . I was very frustrated , until one day .
I came to London , and I &apos;ve seen performance by Cirque du Soleil .
and put it to the highest possible level of performance art . &quot;
I thought &quot; Oh my God , maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers . &quot;
And I did . We started to redesign them , one by one .
It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers .
I &apos;m not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation .
&quot; Covers of the Year &quot; three times in a row .
And music has a rhythm , has ups and downs .
We treated two pages , both spreads , as a one page ,
You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design .
Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland ,
What really makes it amazing : that the circulation of these newspapers
Same in Poland : plus 13 , up to 35 percent
after years of stagnation , the paper started to grow ,
And the process we made was not about changing the look ,
I took an architectural rule about function and form
And I put strategy at the top of it .
So first you ask a big question : why we do it ? What is the goal ?
And then , usually after two months , we start designing .
Why am I asking all of these business questions ,
But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer :
to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end .
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product .
It can change your workflow -- actually , it can change everything in your company ;
You can live in a small poor country , like me .
but still can put your work to the highest possible level .
And you need to remember that to be good
I haven &apos;t talked about probably in more than 10 years .
I came home from work , put a leash on my dog
While I was preparing my dog for the run ,
picked up his car keys , got into a car
is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .
And I remember putting my hands on the ground
is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog .
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well --
so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth .
and they were trying to put a beat back into it .
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck
to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there .
so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well
And in fact , they started to call me a Gomer .
I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together ,
to try to get my feet moving the right way .
And I ended up with a plastic nose , porcelain teeth
But it &apos;s hard sometimes to talk about these things ,
for somebody else that they thought could come back
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover .
So they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a dart ,
and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado .
And I know all of you are scratching your head :
&quot; A senior citizens &apos; home ? What in the world are you going to do there ? &quot;
all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now ,
The one advantage that they had over most of you
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .
And I had a white cane in one hand
and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand .
So they pulled back and they were looking at each other ,
and they were going , &quot; Okay , what skills do we have in this room ?
But one of the first things they needed to do
since I &apos;d been eating through a tube in my chest
So I had to go through trying to eat again .
She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment . &quot;
We &apos;re not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me
But I did say no to the blue hair .
is they decided that , well I need to learn to speak .
if you &apos;re not able to speak and can &apos;t see .
So they figured not being able to see is one thing ,
was teaching me to speak in the day --
But for me , I was an adult and it was embarrassing ,
and capture the air and get the word out .
They were going to make it fun for me .
So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night ,
So I &apos;m going to just leave it to your imagination
And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer &apos;s
took on the task of teaching me to write .
So there were two obstacles I had to get through .
And every time I approached the corner or the curb
was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street .
So one of the seniors just came up to me ,
and she pushed me up to the corner and she said ,
&quot; When you think it &apos;s time to go , just stick the cane out there .
they realized that they needed to put the resources together ,
so that I could go to the Braille Institute
because of the senior citizens who invested in me ,
and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained .
all these things that I had never seen before .
and is replaced with how you feel about things
and I saw this thing sitting in my room
And I go , &quot; I &apos;m just going to touch it . &quot;
The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands
and seeing that I &apos;d lost 10 years of my life .
I thought that time had stood still for some reason
I realized that time marched on for me too
We didn &apos;t have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration
A peasant , who was walking to market that morning ,
and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time .
where he died the next day in the arms of his brother .
And the last words he said to his brother were ,
But a few years earlier , while still at school ,
But the academicians couldn &apos;t understand anything that he wrote .
This is how he wrote most of his mathematics .
So he stayed up the whole night , writing away ,
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny ,
he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation .
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics
was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed .
In microbiology you really don &apos;t want to get a symmetrical object ,
The swine flu virus , at the moment , is a symmetrical object .
But on a larger scale of biology , actually symmetry is very important ,
I &apos;ve taken two pictures here and I &apos;ve made them artificially symmetrical .
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful ,
And if you can make yourself symmetrical , you &apos;re sending out a sign
that you &apos;ve got good genes , you &apos;ve got a good upbringing
So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate
what &apos;s happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .
Or what &apos;s not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles
it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape
and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .
and the letters are triangles , circles and other geometric figures ,
But it &apos;s not just scientists who are interested in symmetry .
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it .
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in &quot; The Magic Mountain . &quot;
and he says he &quot; shuddered at its perfect precision ,
But what artists like to do is to set up expectations
I found , actually , when I visited a colleague of mine
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko .
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs .
has eight columns , with beautiful symmetrical designs on them .
&quot; Wow , the architects must have really been kicking themselves
when they realized that they &apos;d made a mistake and put this one upside down . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , no , no . It was a very deliberate act . &quot;
And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth . &quot;
But if I had to choose one building in the world
to be cast out on a desert island , to live the rest of my life ,
being an addict of symmetry , I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada .
we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips , which my family love .
he &apos;s really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra .
I think one of the problems about school mathematics
is it doesn &apos;t look at how mathematics is embedded
So , I wanted to open his eyes up to
But it &apos;s on the walls where all the exciting things are happening .
What is symmetry ? When &#91; there &#93; are two of these walls ,
to be able to answer some of these questions .
move it in some way , so it looks the same
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves .
What can you do to something ? You close your eyes .
So , for example , the walls in the Alhambra --
I can take all of these tiles , and fix them at the yellow place ,
put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there .
And if you open your eyes again , you wouldn &apos;t know that they &apos;d moved .
But it &apos;s the motion that really characterizes the symmetry
But it &apos;s also about producing a language to describe this .
to change one thing into another , to change geometry into language .
So I &apos;m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --
push you a little bit to understand how this language works ,
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same ?
Well , there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn ,
and still it looks like it did before I started .
I could rotate it by a third of a turn ,
or put it back down on its image , or two thirds of a turn .
And a fifth symmetry , I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn .
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object
that make it look like it did before I started .
Now , for Galois , there was actually a sixth symmetry .
Can anybody think what else I could do to this
which would leave it like I did before I started ?
I can &apos;t flip it because I &apos;ve put a little twist on it , haven &apos;t I ?
But what I could do is just leave it where it is ,
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry .
was a very modern concept , seventh century A.D. , by the Indians .
And this is the same idea . This is a symmetrical --
so everything has symmetry , where you just leave it where it is .
Well , I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise
I can reflect it in the line through X ,
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry
where I just pick it up and leave it where it is .
Now , I &apos;m a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport ,
And I &apos;m going to give a prize at the end of my talk
for the person who gets closest to the answer .
How many things can I do to this object
and put it down so it still looks like a cube ?
Okay ? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on ,
And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end .
But let &apos;s go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects .
What Galois realized : it isn &apos;t just the individual symmetries ,
If I do one magic trick move followed by another ,
of the things unseen , the sort of abstract idea
So I &apos;ve given names . The capital letters , A , B , C , D , E , F ,
to the B on the starfish . And so on .
So what if I do B , which is a sixth of a turn ,
followed by C , which is a third of a turn ?
Well let &apos;s do that . A sixth of a turn ,
the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go .
I do one followed by another , the answer is
What I if I did it in the other order ? Would it make any difference ?
Let &apos;s see . Let &apos;s do the third of the turn first , and then the sixth of a turn .
And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other .
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle .
Let &apos;s see what happens if we do two symmetries
Let &apos;s do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise ,
Well , the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z
followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .
The combined effect , the triangle ends up somewhere completely different .
It &apos;s as if it was reflected in the line through Y.
Now it matters what order you do the operations in .
they both have six symmetries . So why shouldn &apos;t we say
And you can try this when you go down to the pub , later on .
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn ,
then flip it . And then do it in the other order ,
and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction .
Now , Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact .
And , using those rules , he was able to say
And they &apos;ll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle ,
It &apos;s almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry .
In the front here , I &apos;ve got one , two , three people
but the number , the abstract idea of the number , is the same .
And we can see this now : we go back to the walls in the Alhambra .
we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things
with the triangles with a little twist on them .
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn
if you ignore the colors . We &apos;re not matching up the colors .
But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn
What about the center of a triangle ? I can rotate
by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle ,
And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge ,
So rotate along halfway along the edge , and they all match up .
Now , let &apos;s move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra .
And we find the same symmetries here , and the same interaction .
So , there was a sixth of a turn . A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet .
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars .
that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same .
This is a wall , a ceiling , and a floor .
They all look very different . But this language allows us to say
that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object ,
which we call 4-4-2 . Nothing to do with football ,
but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate
by a quarter of a turn , and one by half a turn .
Now , this power of the language is even more ,
&quot; Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries
different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra .
And they , if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one ,
it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17 .
all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space .
So I think it &apos;s a great example of things unseen ,
which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .
So , like Galois , I stayed up all last night
Well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . If I could have my board
So I &apos;m going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object
and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --
what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning .
Rather than you all shouting out , I want you to count how many digits there are
If you &apos;ve got it as a factorial , you &apos;ve got to expand the factorials .
If you think you &apos;ve got an estimate for how many digits ,
If you all stay down he wins it automatically .
Okay . Excellent . So we &apos;ve got four here , five , six .
Great . Excellent . That should get us going . All right .
Anybody with five or less digits , you &apos;ve got to sit down ,
Five or less digits . So , if you &apos;re in the tens of thousands you &apos;ve got to sit down .
60 digits or more , you &apos;ve got to sit down .
Let &apos;s have the other ones , who sat down during the 20 , up again . Okay ?
If I told you 20 or less , stand up .
Because this one . I think there were a few here .
Okay , how many digits do you have in your number ?
21 . Okay good . How many do you have in yours ?
It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik &apos;s cube
in the mathematical language . So you can &apos;t have that one .
So Ghez , there we go . That &apos;s your new symmetrical object .
I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala ,
where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you ,
for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala .
And I think what drives me , as a mathematician ,
are those things which are not seen , the things that we haven &apos;t discovered .
It &apos;s all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject .
And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese &quot; Essays in Idleness &quot; :
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth . &quot; Thank you .
so many of the things that we &apos;re enjoying today ,
so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED
Now let &apos;s advance to 10,000 years before the present .
have shown that they were grinding grain morning , noon and night .
It was the beginning of a much higher degree
And we are also changing our teeth right now .
But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal ,
to where you or your ancestors happen to stand .
there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences ,
and there was a very healthy sense of caution ,
&quot; This I will not treat . This I cannot treat . &quot;
show how important it is not to do harm .
that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery
to one in which there was a hopeful outlook ,
that he was not always going to do the right thing .
was a little slow to seep through the general population ,
in the most complex machine of all times --
because it did everything that a human being did
Unfortunately , he was smitten in more ways than one ,
Now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century
The lesson of the Titanic , for a lot of the contemporaries ,
a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,
It &apos;s really a question of the system , how the ship was loaded ,
but it may be one of the greatest of all times ,
was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War .
A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it .
and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time .
that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain .
Now when we come to the period after the Second World War ,
but it was the precise temperature of the water
and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic
And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads
So it shows that we &apos;re really all in this together .
So one of the characteristic problems of our time
was the way in which other kinds of calamities
and they &apos;ve discovered that the greatest number , the greatest decade ,
as reflected in all of the lists that others have made --
a number of lists that they have merged --
but he couldn &apos;t really find an alternative technical job .
So this was the best job he could get .
He was upset by the low quality and high cost
that we &apos;re living in a time of unexpected possibilities .
Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now --
and it &apos;s very possible that the solutions to those
the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry ,
which was a problem in Europe at the time --
We need to see what they can do for us .
We need to learn , for example , from Dr. Cushing ,
He had to have some errors . He had to have some mistakes .
which they hadn &apos;t really been for years and years .
They might have been able to do it earlier .
So , I kind of believe that we &apos;re in like the &quot; cave-painting &quot; era of computer interfaces .
Like , they &apos;re very kind of -- they don &apos;t go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be
OK . So I mean , this is the kind of status quo interface , right ?
And OK , so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac ,
you know , but really it &apos;s the kind of same old crap we &apos;ve had for the last ,
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers .
I mean it &apos;s point and click , it &apos;s like the menus , icons , it &apos;s all the kind of same thing .
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk .
It &apos;s so much more subtle , so much more visceral
And I &apos;d like to bring that experience to the desktop .
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop .
It &apos;s kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .
So you can bump things -- they &apos;re all physically , you know , manipulable and stuff .
And instead of that point and click , it &apos;s like a push and pull ,
things collide as you &apos;d expect them . Just like on my real desk ,
I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid ,
or you know , flip through them like a book
or I can lay them out like a deck of cards .
When they &apos;re laid out , I can pull things to new locations or delete things
or just quickly sort a whole pile , you know , just immediately , right ?
And then , it &apos;s all smoothly animated , instead of these jarring changes you see in today &apos;s interfaces .
Also , if I want to add something to a pile , well , how do I do that ?
I just toss it to the pile , and it &apos;s added right to the top . It &apos;s a kind of nice way .
Also some of the stuff we can do is ,
for these individual icons we thought -- I mean ,
how can we play with the idea of an icon , and push that further ?
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger
if I want to emphasize it and make it more important .
But what &apos;s really cool is that since there &apos;s a physics simulation running under this ,
it &apos;s actually heavier . So the lighter stuff doesn &apos;t really move
but if I throw it at the lighter guys , right ?
So it &apos;s cute , but it &apos;s also like a subtle channel of conveying information , right ?
This is heavy so it feels more important . So it &apos;s kind of cool .
because it has a lot of , I think , valuable properties .
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .
So one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them ,
just like paper . Remember , you know , something for later .
Or if you want to be destructive , you can just crumple it up
we &apos;ll pin things up to the wall to remember them later ,
and you know , you &apos;ll see post-it notes and things like that around people &apos;s offices .
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them .
So , one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that ,
you know , &quot; Okay , well my real desk is really messy . I don &apos;t want that mess on my computer . &quot;
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align ,
kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop . Things are kind of grid aligned .
More boring , but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping .
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop .
Let &apos;s just break this shelf . Okay , that shelf broke .
I think beyond the icons , I think another really cool domain for this software --
I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs .
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs
and bring it to that kind of shoebox of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
I can toss these things around . They &apos;re so much more tangible and touchable --
and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it .
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before .
So I can pile things up , I can flip through it , I can , you know --
okay , let &apos;s move this photo to the back , let &apos;s delete this guy here ,
and I think it &apos;s just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .
in the sense that he went there to Argentina
But it &apos;s also a fiction . There &apos;s a lot of work that went into it after that .
to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index .
when we were deep in the valley over there .
and it &apos;s with those teeth that I want to propose today
from being something that we extract and derive from the world
to something that actually starts to shape it --
the world around us and the world inside us .
And I was thinking about this , of all places ,
on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago ,
about what life was like during the Cold War
And he said , &quot; Well we were mostly breaking stealth . &quot;
And I said , &quot; That &apos;s a good job . That &apos;s interesting .
you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .
right through 156 tons of steel in the sky .
But if you can take this big , massive thing ,
And if you &apos;re a radar , that &apos;s a really bad job .
And he said , &quot; Yeah . &quot; He said , &quot; But that &apos;s if you &apos;re a radar .
we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals ,
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication ,
we thought , &apos; Probably has something to do with the Americans . &apos; &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now ,
And I said , &quot; What &apos;s the black box for Wall Street ? &quot;
whether it &apos;s Proctor &amp; amp ; Gamble or Accenture , whatever --
it &apos;s like playing poker and going all in right away .
And so they have to find a way --
that you use to break up the big thing
can be used to find a million little things
and figure out what &apos;s actually happening in the market .
of what &apos;s happening in the stock market right now ,
what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms
and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act .
nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes ,
and they called it the Flash Crash of 2 : 45 .
All of a sudden , nine percent just goes away ,
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening .
we &apos;re writing these things that we can no longer read .
and they find , actually sometimes , some of these algorithms .
And when they find them they pull them out
and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .
when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don &apos;t understand --
that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look ,
You can find it here : this book about flies
that you may have been looking at on Amazon .
If you had bought it at 1.7 , it would have been a bargain .
Nobody was buying or selling anything ; what was happening ?
as surely as you see it on Wall Street .
And as with Amazon , so it is with Netflix .
They started with Cinematch , and they &apos;ve tried a bunch of others --
and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down ,
Well , a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood ,
And the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t Google .
And they &apos;re in your house . They &apos;re in your house .
These are two algorithms competing for your living room .
that have very different ideas about what clean means .
if you slow it down and attach lights to them ,
and they &apos;re sort of like secret architects in your bedroom .
These are the ones where you have to press what floor you &apos;re going to go to
of letting everybody go into whatever car they want .
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two ,
and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five .
is just the number that moves up or down
And how far can you take that ? How far can you take it ?
So let me take it back to Wall Street .
And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are ,
you &apos;d look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt
throwing out all the furniture , all the infrastructure for human use ,
to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in --
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system .
And of course , it is , but it &apos;s distributed from places .
In New York , this is where it &apos;s distributed from :
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city .
And the reality is that the further away you are from that ,
none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space
37 times faster than you can click a mouse --
Unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
is that , if you &apos;re trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are ,
you &apos;re going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are
And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots
is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do : we &apos;ll build bubbles or something ,
And it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
and you realize that they &apos;re not metaphor , they &apos;re prophecy .
But now there &apos;s this third co-evolutionary force : algorithms --
And we will have to understand those as nature ,
so I &apos;m going to have to talk fast , and it will
use up your spare mental cycles , so multitasking may be hard .
So , 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout .
So , traffic keeps flowing , so that means less braking ,
which means less accelerating , less gas and less pollution ,
This is one in my neighborhood . And they are
much better -- better than traffic lights , better than four-way stop signs .
but they are more expensive not to . So , we should look at that .
So , here &apos;s one . There &apos;s another one which I studied .
And so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
and so that &apos;s two ounces of gas to accelerate out of .
That &apos;s five cents each , and times 3,000 cars per day ,
That &apos;s just the gasoline cost . There is also pollution ,
that &apos;s 8.3 hours per day . The average wage in the U.S.
is $ 20 an hour . That is 60,000 per year .
Add that together with the gas , and it &apos;s $ 112,000 per year ,
Discount that back to the present , at five percent :
Now , if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line ,
So , it makes one wonder , &quot; Why is it there ? &quot;
I mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ?
Because it is saving lives . So , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there
and if they &apos;re waiting forever a long queue could form
because the cars aren &apos;t slowing down on the main road .
So , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
yield signs in 1950 . But that &apos;s all we got .
Well the meaning of yield is : You must yield the right-of-way .
That means that if there are five cars waiting , you have to wait
till they all go , then you go . It lacks the notion
So , it &apos;s hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .
what you used to do at yield signs ? Now do something different . &quot;
you know , for those who didn &apos;t see the public service announcements .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
It &apos;s kind of shaped like a T , as in taking turns .
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don &apos;t know how to deal with
So , now that you are all &quot; Road Scholars &quot; ...
don &apos;t wait for that sign to be adopted , these things don &apos;t change quickly .
And you can have more impact on the environment
than by changing your vehicle . Thank you very much .
and then all of our problems will be solved .
When I make an incision inside a patient &apos;s body , it &apos;s dark .
We need to shine light to see what we &apos;re doing .
surgeries have always started so early in the morning --
For example , this is the oldest operating room in the Western world ,
of one of the most famous hospitals in America .
And do you know where the operating room is ?
And because we no longer need to use sunlight ,
we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this
That &apos;s so easy anybody could become a surgeon , right ?
However , when we have a real patient on the table ,
enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out ,
I don &apos;t care if it has this gene or that gene ,
or if it has this protein or that protein ,
and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels
and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience ,
We &apos;ve made a good job . We &apos;ve taken it out .
That &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room
But then we actually don &apos;t know that it &apos;s all out .
We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed ,
and then send those bits to the pathology lab .
In the meanwhile , the patient &apos;s on the operating room table .
freezes it , cuts it , looks in the microscope one by one
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece .
&quot; You know what , points A and B are okay ,
but point C , you still have some residual cancer there .
So we go back and we do that again , and again .
we actually found that there &apos;s a couple other spots
So now you &apos;re faced with telling your patient , first of all ,
whether or not there &apos;s still cancer on the surgical field ?
I mean , in many ways , the way that we &apos;re doing it ,
who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry
The main part of it is the blue part , polycation ,
and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer ,
So when those two are together , the molecule is neutral
if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule
along with the dye , which is shown in green ,
We can tell in the operating room , in the field ,
where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do
and how much more work they need to do
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,
There &apos;s actually normal muscle on top of it . See that ?
but you can see it even if it &apos;s not right on the top --
has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer , melanoma .
that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer .
is if the lymph node did not have cancer ,
But sentinel lymph node , the way that we do it today ,
and you want to know where &apos;s the next gas station ,
you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
You have to cut it out , bring it back home ,
So with our technology , we can tell right away .
You see a lot of little , roundish bumps there .
Who amongst us hasn &apos;t had swollen lymph nodes with a cold ?
to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence ,
we can also use the same smart three-part molecule
you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer
That &apos;s a lot of people to have a lot of problems --
which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem ,
But you know what , these little nerves are so small ,
And they &apos;re known because somebody has decided to study them ,
we &apos;re trying to excise cancer , we don &apos;t know where the cancer is .
We &apos;re trying to preserve nerves ; we can &apos;t see where they are .
And at first this didn &apos;t get a lot of support .
People said , &quot; We &apos;ve been doing it this way for all these years .
Here you &apos;re looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse ,
and you can see that that big , fat portion you can see very easily .
But in fact , at the tip of that where I &apos;m dissecting now ,
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out .
for facial expression , for facial movement , for breathing --
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ?
What about the nerve that &apos;s going into this tumor ?
But what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
I think that it &apos;ll change the way that we do surgery .
in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues .
I think that this will result in my surgeries
We know that this can be done and we &apos;re committed to doing it .
I &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
It is not an event for the solo runner .
And that is the light that I want to shine
You woke up , felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door ,
and felt in awe when you found something new .
But I bet there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t think about today --
that you probably don &apos;t think about it very often at all .
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside --
have allowed us to zoom in on the brain ,
and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons .
where there &apos;s a fairly small number of different parts --
we know how they work , because we humans designed them --
the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells ,
They come in different shapes ; they &apos;re made out of different molecules .
And they project and connect to different brain regions ,
and they also change different ways in different disease states .
a fairly small cell , an inhibitory cell , that quiets its neighbors .
It &apos;s one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia .
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell
they can span a significant fraction of the brain .
that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
And this process , which takes just a millisecond or so ,
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
and turn these different kinds of cell on and off
If we could activate cells , we could see what powers they can unleash ,
then we could try and figure out what they &apos;re necessary for .
And that &apos;s a story I &apos;m going to tell you about today .
And honestly , where we &apos;ve gone through over the last 11 years ,
of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain
the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room ,
they not only steal our time to live , they change who we are .
through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders ,
practically none of them can be considered to be cured .
And part of that &apos;s because we &apos;re bathing the brain in the chemical .
made out of thousands of different kinds of cell
That &apos;s also why , perhaps , most of the drugs , and not all , on the market
can present some kind of serious side effect too .
from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain .
But electricity also will go in all directions --
which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go ?
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago ,
I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist ,
all we need to do is to find some way
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell ,
that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells ,
figure out what they do and how they contribute
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature ,
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow ,
then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light .
And their neighbors , which don &apos;t have the molecule , would not .
There &apos;s one other magic trick you need to make this all happen ,
and that &apos;s the ability to get light into the brain .
And to do that -- the brain doesn &apos;t feel pain -- you can put --
that &apos;s gone into the Internet and communications and so on --
that you can use to activate , in animal models for example ,
There &apos;s a certain alga that swims in the wild ,
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about .
When blue light hits it , it opens up a little hole
and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal
just like a solar cell charging up a battery .
So what we need to do is to take these molecules
it &apos;s encoded for in the DNA of this organism .
So all we &apos;ve got to do is take that DNA ,
put it into a gene therapy vector , like a virus ,
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy ,
So this turned out to be very simple to do .
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,
we gave it a try , and it worked on the first try .
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .
you have a neuron which can be activated with light .
is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want
And you can do that ; you can tweak the viruses
so they hit just some cells and not others .
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do ,
use one of these viruses to deliver the gene
just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
And then when you shine light on the entire network ,
So for example , lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier --
If we can deliver that gene to these cells --
and they &apos;re not going to be altered by the expression of the gene , of course --
and then flash blue light over the entire brain network ,
And when the light turns off , these cells go back to normal ,
so they don &apos;t seem to be averse against that .
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do ,
what their power is in computing in the brain ,
but you can also use this to try to figure out --
well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells ,
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories
is , what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward ?
those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction .
So if we could figure out what cells they are ,
for which drugs could be designed or screened against ,
or maybe places where electrodes could be put in
So to do that , we came up with a very simple paradigm
if the animal goes there , the animal gets a pulse of light
in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .
This animal &apos;s going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there ,
and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that .
And he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
which some of you may have heard about , in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .
Now we &apos;ve shown that a brief activation of these
each coupled to its own independent miniature light source .
And then we can try to do things in vivo
that have only been done to-date in a dish --
for the signals that can cause certain things to happen .
And one story I want to tell you about
is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder --
was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
The shock isn &apos;t painful , but it &apos;s a little annoying .
And over time -- in this case , a mouse ,
which is a good animal model , commonly used in such experiments --
Now the question is , what targets in the brain can we find
So what we do is we play that tone again
But we activate targets in the brain , different ones ,
using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide ,
in order to try and figure out which targets
can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear .
shows you one of these targets that we &apos;re working on now .
a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states .
And the animal &apos;s going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there .
There &apos;s no audio on this , but you can see the animal &apos;s freezing .
And there &apos;s a little clock in the lower left-hand corner ,
so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .
And the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
And now you can see , just 10 minutes into the experiment ,
that we &apos;ve equipped the brain by photoactivating this area
Now over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve gone back to the tree of life
because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .
If we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds ,
you can figure out what necessary role they play
And we &apos;ve now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life --
every kingdom of life except for animals , we see slightly differently .
And we found all sorts of molecules , they &apos;re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins ,
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before
Let &apos;s give an example of where we think this is going to go .
one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain .
But that &apos;s obviously irreversible , and there could be side effects .
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time ,
and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state --
sort of like a dynamical system that &apos;s being coaxed down into a stable state .
So this animation just tries to explain this concept
where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light ,
and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure ,
we &apos;re hoping to be able to turn it off .
And so we don &apos;t have data to show you on this front ,
which is that maybe these molecules , if you can do ultra-precise control ,
to make a new kind of prosthetic , an optical prosthetic .
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
There &apos;s another thing , which is you &apos;ve got to get these genes into cells .
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed
which probably most of us around this room have ,
to deliver genes into the brain or the body .
And so far , there have not been serious adverse events
There &apos;s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves ,
Most of us don &apos;t have fungi or algae in our brains ,
so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?
Are the cells going to tolerate it ? Will the immune system react ?
In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet --
and so far we haven &apos;t seen overt reactions of any severity
or to the illumination of the brain with light .
So it &apos;s early days , to be upfront , but we &apos;re excited about it .
our light sensors that are in the back of our eye , are gone .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Now let &apos;s zoom in on it here , so we can see it in more detail .
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top ,
and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors
until finally that layer of cells at the bottom , the ganglion cells ,
It &apos;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored ,
because there &apos;s nothing for the drug to bind to .
On the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules
and install them on some of these other spare cells
And because there &apos;s so many of these cells in the eye ,
and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience ,
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze .
It &apos;s a six-arm maze . And there &apos;s a bit of water in the maze
to motivate the mouse to move , or he &apos;ll just sit there .
is to get out of the water and go to a little platform
Now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually ,
He &apos;s swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform .
that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans .
And so we &apos;re being careful in trying to look at these different models
We &apos;re going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide .
in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye
just like installing solar cells all over those neurons
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment
and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus .
And now you can see , the animal can indeed avoid walls
these animals are able to get to that platform
just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives .
To close , I want to point out that we &apos;re also exploring
new business models for this new field of neurotechnology .
but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world ,
so people can study and try to treat different disorders .
And our hope is that , by figuring out brain circuits
at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them ,
we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier ,
Juan Enriquez : So some of the stuff is a little dense .
The second thing that I think I heard you say
is you can now control the brain in two colors ,
JE : Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code .
So with blue light , we can drive information , and it &apos;s in the form of a one .
And by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors
so we can augment functions in people with disabilities .
you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros .
EB : Sure , yeah . We &apos;re hoping to use this as a way of testing
and use that to understand more about the brain .
JE : Does that mean that some day you could download memories
EB : Well that &apos;s something we &apos;re starting to work on very hard .
where we &apos;re trying to tile the brain with recording elements too .
So we can record information and then drive information back in --
JE : Well , that might change a couple things . Thank you .
spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors ,
with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye :
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors ,
And we looked at three different types of rooms .
where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation
If you look at the x-axis of this graph ,
you &apos;ll see that what we commonly want to do --
So if you look at the green data points ,
you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of microbial diversity ,
But if you look at the blue data points ,
If you look at the y-axis of this graph ,
And the first things that you can see from this graph
is , if you look at the blue data points ,
they &apos;re not simply a subset of the green data points ,
that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
may not necessarily be the best for our health .
this is a clue that it &apos;s a good time
And for this reason , many people eat probiotic yogurt
I want to take you back basically to my hometown ,
and to a picture of my hometown of the week
so the plume was luckily blowing west , away from us .
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours --
And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences
of a book and a baby , and having this event happen so close --
that my first thought , when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all
or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building ,
was that I &apos;d made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I &apos;d just written .
Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power
and creative potential of density , of largely urban density ,
of connecting people and putting them together in one place ,
and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas
And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling ,
those towers burning and falling -- that in fact , one of the lessons
And that of all the technologies that were exploited
probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives
were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings
you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers ,
And so I started to think , well , you know , density , density --
I &apos;m not sure if , you know , this was the right call .
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days .
And then about two days later , the wind started to change a little bit ,
and you could sense that the air was not healthy .
And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village
where we lived , my wife sent me out to buy a , you know ,
a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond ,
And obviously I &apos;m physically a very strong person , as you can tell -- --
so I wasn &apos;t worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks .
And I walked out , and this really miraculous thing happened to me
as I was walking north to buy this air filter ,
which was that the streets were completely alive with people .
There was an incredible -- it was , you know , a beautiful day ,
and the West Village had never seemed more lively .
where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book
that so influenced what I was writing in &quot; Emergence &quot; --
that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death ,
and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids .
And all the people who lived in the neighborhood ,
were all out there -- had them all open .
There were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working .
All the things that make a great city successful
and all the things that make a great city stimulating --
they were all on display there on those streets .
And I thought , well , this is the power of a city .
we talked about cities as being centralized in space ,
but what makes them so strong most of the time
They don &apos;t have a center executive branch that you can take out
If they did , it probably was right there at Ground Zero .
I mean , you know , the emergency bunker was right there ,
and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives .
But nonetheless , just 20 blocks north , two days later ,
If you &apos;d gone into the minds of the people ,
well , you would have seen a lot of trauma ,
and you would have seen a lot of heartache ,
and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover .
But the system itself of this city was thriving .
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well ,
and how some of those reasons kind of map
on to where the Web is going right now .
The question that I found myself asking to people
when I was talking about the book afterwards is --
the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that
and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality ?
but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody .
Same thing to the question of , who was keeping the streets alive
And this is increasingly what we &apos;re starting to see on the Web
when I was writing &quot; Emergence &quot; and when the book came out .
So it &apos;s been a very optimistic time , I think ,
and I want to just talk about a few of those things .
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity
This is not the future King of England , although it looks like it .
It &apos;s some guy , it &apos;s a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online
who &apos;s interested , if you look at the bottom , in soccer and Jesus
and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and &quot; my hometown &quot; -- those are his links .
this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real ,
that kind of conjures up that period better than that , I think ,
which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog
and link to it , and somebody reading the page
has the power to click on that link or not click on that link .
And , you know , I don &apos;t want to belittle that . That , in a sense --
to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday --
that was , in a sense , the kind of interface electricity that
powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web :
that you could put up a link , and somebody could click on it ,
and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go .
But it &apos;s still a very one-to-one kind of relationship .
There &apos;s one person putting up the link , and there &apos;s another person
on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not .
and we &apos;ve already seen a couple of references to this .
This is what happens when you search &quot; Steven Johnson &quot; on Google .
About two months ago , I had the great breakthrough --
one of my great , kind of shining achievements --
which is that my website finally became a top result for &quot; Steven Johnson . &quot;
There &apos;s some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson
who has dropped two spots , I &apos;m happy to say .
And , you know , I mean , I &apos;ll look at a couple of things like this ,
but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing .
It &apos;s just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze .
what &apos;s creating this page , obviously -- and we all know this ,
is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson ,
putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it ,
and Google just sitting there and running the numbers .
This page is effectively , collectively authored by the Web ,
kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place .
Now , they &apos;re more innovative -- well , Google &apos;s pretty innovative --
There &apos;s this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati --
that &apos;s filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these .
And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs .
He &apos;s analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he &apos;s tracking .
And he &apos;s tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs ,
and so you have kind of an authority --
a weblog that has a lot of links to it
is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it .
And so at any given time , on any given page on the Web , actually ,
you can say , what does the weblog community think about this page ?
This is what they think about my site ; it &apos;s ranked by blog authority .
You can also rank it by the latest posts .
I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture
but they wouldn &apos;t necessarily know that you were pointing to them .
And that was one of the reasons why the web
because you needed two-way linking , you needed that kind of feedback mechanism
Now what &apos;s interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger ,
where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web --
He has this line where he says , you know , you &apos;re going to put up a link there ,
if you see a link , somebody decided to put it there .
And he says , the link to one site didn &apos;t just grow on the other page &quot; like a tree fungus . &quot;
And in fact , I think that &apos;s not entirely true anymore .
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati
and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes .
I wouldn &apos;t really be directly in control of it .
So it &apos;s much closer , in a way , to a data fungus , in a sense ,
wrapped around that page , than it is to a deliberate link that I &apos;ve placed there .
Now , what you &apos;re having here is basically a global brain
that you &apos;re able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it &apos;s thinking .
which looks at search requests to test what &apos;s going on , what people are interested in ,
and they publish it with lots of fun graphs .
And I &apos;m saying a lot of nice things about Google ,
so I &apos;ll be I &apos;ll be saying one little critical thing .
which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching
for Britney Spears pictures , which is not necessarily news .
The Columbia blows up , suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia .
Well , you know , we should expect to see that .
So the key thing in terms of these new tools
that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain ,
that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream --
the question is , are you finding out something new ?
And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share
and then you search the results that you get back for somebody &apos;s name .
So basically , the number of pages that mention this term ,
that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages
Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet , I might add .
But the interesting thing is , you can broaden the search a little bit .
And it turns out , actually , that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish .
I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide
I also did -- and I don &apos;t want to start a little fight in the next panel --
but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection .
So right here -- now this is a big category , you have smaller percentages ,
so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett , who &apos;ll be speaking shortly .
So Dennett &apos;s in the lead a little bit there .
But what &apos;s interesting is you can then broaden the search
and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .
So Gary Bauer is not too far behind --
has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection .
And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard . So --
you can see we &apos;re in the ascot , which is always good .
And by the way , Chris , that would &apos;ve been a really good panel ,
Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing ,
but this analysis some of you may have seen .
looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses .
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere ,
so they &apos;re kind of , you know , memes that start taking off ,
that didn &apos;t have a lot of historical precedent before .
So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s --
That &apos;s Britney Spears . I mean , you know , OK , interesting .
And OK , I didn &apos;t learn anything new there as well -- that &apos;s pretty obvious .
1985 , right at the center of the Reagan years --
Now , there &apos;s one way to interpret this , which is to say that
&quot; emancipation &quot; and &quot; depression &quot; and &quot; recovery &quot; all have a lot of syllables .
So you know , you can actually download -- it &apos;s hard to remember those .
in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise ,
is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country
and shifting to a much more intimate , much more folksy , much more telegenic --
You know , 20 years before it was still , &quot; Ask not what you can do , &quot;
but with Reagan , it &apos;s , &quot; that &apos;s where , there &apos;s Nancy and I , &quot; that kind of language .
but you didn &apos;t actually notice syntactically what he was doing .
The question now -- and this is the really interesting question --
is , what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now
in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs
because they are really kind of at the cutting edge .
And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system .
Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky
that got a lot of attention about a month ago ,
on the web to all these various different blogs .
It follows a power law , so that there are a few extremely well-linked to , popular blogs ,
and a long tail of blogs with very few links .
So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links .
because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,
one modem democracy , where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .
And so the question is , &quot; Why is this happening ? &quot;
It &apos;s an emergent property of the blogosphere right now .
Now , what &apos;s great about it is that people are working on --
within seconds of Clay publishing this piece , people started working on changing
the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing .
largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage .
if you &apos;re the first site there , everybody links to you .
If you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links ,
and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future ,
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on ,
literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece --
was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers .
And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don &apos;t have a lot of links ,
that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours .
So in a sense , bursty weblogs coming from new voices .
So he &apos;s working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system .
but you &apos;re changing the underlying rules in interesting ways
So the most amazing thing about this -- and I &apos;ll end on this note --
are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern
and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not .
So the most wonderful thing , I think , about this whole debate
about power laws and software that could change it
I think for people like me in the world of the making of things ,
And so the question that we might not have birds
became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around
looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared .
Now , I &apos;m not a scientist , that &apos;ll be really clear .
But , you know , we &apos;ve just come from this discussion of what a bird might be .
Well , in my world , this is a rubber duck .
&quot; This product contains chemicals known by the State of California
to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm . &quot;
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind
and then label it and sell it to children ?
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave
called &quot; The Monticello Dialogues &quot; on NPR , and sent me this as a thank you note --
&quot; We realize that design is a signal of intention ,
but it also has to occur within a world ,
and we have to understand that world in order to
and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs
in which we design , we , in a way , need to go to the primordial condition
to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet ,
and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that &apos;s there ,
and I think as our culture tortures itself now
we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent ,
This is -- I put it down at the bottom ,
So what are our intentions , and what would our intentions be --
if we wake up in the morning , we have designs on the world --
well , what would our intention be as a species
because how could you dominate something you had killed ?
because you can &apos;t be steward of something if you can &apos;t dominate it .
So the question is , what is the first question for designers ?
Now , as guardians -- let &apos;s say the state , for example ,
which reserves the right to kill , the right to be duplicitous and so on --
the question we &apos;re asking the guardian at this point is
But I don &apos;t know that that &apos;s the common debate .
value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work ,
how do we love all the children of all species for all time ?
And so we start our designs with that question .
Because what we realize today is that modern culture
If we come here and say , &quot; Well , I didn &apos;t intend
and we say , &quot; That &apos;s not part of my plan , &quot;
then we realize it &apos;s part of our de facto plan .
Because it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s happening because we have no other plan .
And I was at the White House for President Bush ,
and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan .
If the end game is global warming , they &apos;re doing great .
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children
downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act ,
then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as ,
&quot; Brain death for all children . No child left behind . &quot;
are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families ?
So if you don &apos;t have an endgame of something delightful ,
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change ,
which requires humility . And in my business as an architect ,
it &apos;s unfortunate the word &quot; humility &quot; and the word &quot; architect &quot;
have not appeared in the same paragraph since &quot; The Fountainhead . &quot;
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility ,
reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years
So , as Kevin Kelly pointed out , there is no endgame .
There is an infinite game , and we &apos;re playing in that infinite game .
This is what I presented to the White House .
Our goal is a delightfully diverse , safe , healthy and just world ,
with clean air , clean water , soil and power --
even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said
when asked what it was like to be President of France .
He said , &quot; What do you think it &apos;s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ? &quot;
But at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .
and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black ?
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations .
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes .
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification , the dead zones
that &apos;s beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind
here in the Great Plains , and so that hegemony is leaving .
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC ,
they asked him , &quot; When will we see the end of the age of oil ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was ,
&quot; The Stone Age didn &apos;t end because we ran out of stones . &quot;
We see that companies acting ethically in this world
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect .
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles , sent to China .
release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens &apos; environment ,
On the other hand , we see great signs of hope .
He has given eyesight to two million people for free .
We see in our material flows that car steels don &apos;t become car steel again
The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam ,
Now if I was a bird , the building on my left is a liability .
The building on my right , which is our corporate campus for The Gap
with an ancient meadow , is an asset -- its nesting grounds .
Here &apos;s where I come from . I grew up in Hong Kong ,
During the dry season , we had four hours of water every fourth day .
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been
farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries .
You can &apos;t farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington ,
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics ,
so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off .
studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier ,
And this might have worked in Berlin , but we built it in Houston ,
and the windows are all closed . And with most products
appearing not to have been designed for indoor use ,
When I went to Yale , we had the first energy crisis ,
and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland
which would give you a sense of my ambition .
And Richard Meier , who was one of my teachers ,
kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism ,
and he would say , &quot; Bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- --
In 1984 , we did the first so-called &quot; green office &quot; in America
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials .
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time
and it was to prove there was no danger
So , all of a sudden , here I am , graduating from high school in 1969,
and this happens , and we realize that &quot; away &quot; went away .
Remember we used to throw things away , and we &apos;d point to away ?
And yet , NOAA has now shown us , for example --
and they found six times as much plastic as plankton .
When asked , they said , &quot; It &apos;s kind of like a giant toilet that doesn &apos;t flush . &quot;
So we &apos;re looking for the design rules of this --
this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world , Irian Jaya ,
The book itself is a polymer . It is not a tree .
That &apos;s the name of the first chapter -- &quot; This Book is Not a Tree . &quot;
&quot; we write our history on the skin of fish
And with so much polymer , what we really need
as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment :
fixes nitrogen , distills water , accrues solar energy as fuel ,
Well , why don &apos;t we knock that down and write on it ?
as most people -- you know , can I afford it ?
We &apos;re adding the Jeffersonian agenda , and I come from Charlottesville ,
where I &apos;ve had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson .
We &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
You know , most people don &apos;t realize it comes from
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other .
So we &apos;ve been looking at the idea of competition
as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .
not in just competition terms in our modern context
of destroy the other or beat them to the ground ,
because , in our lexicon , asphalt is two words : assigning blame .
But if we look at asphalt as our growth ,
then we realize that all we &apos;re doing is destroying
So when we see E equals mc squared come along , from a poet &apos;s perspective ,
and all of a sudden , you get this biology .
And we have plenty of energy , so we &apos;ll solve that problem ,
but the biology problem &apos;s tricky , because as we put through
that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --
and it needs to be an open system of chemicals .
So we &apos;re asking for human artifice to become a living thing ,
and we want growth , we want free energy from sunlight
Then , the question becomes not growth or no growth ,
we want to grow the things that we might enjoy ,
and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese .
and I worked with a German chemist , Michael Braungart ,
but also the technical one , where we take materials
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition .
which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton ,
the world would run out of cork and dry up .
but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million
heavy metal content , knowledge of how we &apos;re making them
Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals
in human manufacturing , and we &apos;re releasing this database into the public in six weeks .
So designers all over the world can analyze their products
down to the parts per million for human and ecological health .
We &apos;ve developed a protocol so that companies can send
these same messages all the way through their supply chains ,
because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars
-- and say , &quot; Where does your stuff come from ? &quot; They say , &quot; Suppliers . &quot;
the water coming out was clean enough to drink .
Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet , infinitely reusable carpet .
Here &apos;s nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor ,
Shoes for Nike , where the uppers are polyesters , infinitely recyclable ,
Wear your old shoes in , your new shoes out .
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials
go back to the industry forever , some of the materials go back to soil --
that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water .
Here &apos;s a building for The Gap , where the ancient grasses
And this is our project for Ford Motor Company .
It &apos;s the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn .
These are our tools . These are how we sold it to Ford .
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way , day one ,
at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars .
Here it is . It &apos;s the world &apos;s largest green roof , 10 and a half acres .
and this is the first species to arrive here . These are killdeer .
The country -- the home of biological . And putting them together .
And so I will finish by showing you a new city
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing
We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick ,
they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal .
They &apos;ll have cities with no energy and no food .
Because if they toxify themselves , being the lowest-cost producer ,
send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --
and then we send them all our money , what we &apos;ll discover is that
we have what , effectively , when I was a student ,
Now we do it by molecule . These are our cities .
We &apos;re building a new city next to this city ; look at that landscape .
We don &apos;t normally do green fields , but this one is about to be built ,
It &apos;s a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape .
And they brought us in and said , &quot; What would you do ? &quot;
This is what they would end up with , which is another color photograph .
So this is the existing site , so this is what it looks like now ,
We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city
will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight
in every single apartment at some point during the day .
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
so the people all have centers and places to be .
We have a 24-hour street , so that there &apos;s always a place that &apos;s alive .
If you flush a toilet , your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants ,
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas ?
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations .
And then it makes natural gas , which then goes back into the city
to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants .
to the roofs of the city , where we &apos;ve got farming ,
because what we &apos;ve done is lifted up the city ,
the landscape , into the air to -- to restore the native landscape
and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city .
And this is the concept for the top of the city .
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next .
We inhabit the city with work / live space on all the ground floors .
And so this is the existing city , and this is the new city .
Now just like the physical maps of our world
Most people , when they first look at a fresh human brain ,
they say , &quot; It doesn &apos;t look what you &apos;re typically looking at
Typically , what you &apos;re looking at is a fixed brain . It &apos;s gray .
20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart ,
Scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century ,
where activity was going on in the human brain .
So for example , they can see in the back part of the brain ,
There &apos;s the cerebellum ; that &apos;s keeping you upright right now .
It &apos;s keeping me standing . It &apos;s involved in coordinated movement .
This is the area where primary auditory processing --
you &apos;re sending it up into higher language processing centers .
is the place in which all of the more complex thought , decision making --
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on .
you probably aren &apos;t going to order the steak for dinner .
So if you take a deeper look at the brain ,
one of the things , if you look at it in cross-section ,
is that you can &apos;t really see a whole lot of structure there .
some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells .
And that &apos;s shown here in the the very light blue .
And what you can see is it &apos;s very non-uniform . You see a lot more structure there .
But you can also see things underneath there as well .
are the areas in which the wires are running through .
So there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
And as you can see , they &apos;re very non-uniformly distributed .
since we can now start to map brain function ,
we can start to tie these into the individual cells .
So as I mentioned , there are 86 billion neurons .
There are also these smaller cells as you &apos;ll see .
to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain .
They &apos;re proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
They &apos;re controlling who nervous system cells partner up with .
basically everything that the nervous system has to do .
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level ,
understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on .
This a place where the dead are brought in .
There &apos;s a lot of criteria by which we &apos;re selecting these brains .
that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,
Because what we &apos;re trying to measure , the RNA --
we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains .
Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life .
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection
It &apos;s a standard template by which we &apos;re going to hang the rest of this data .
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .
is we collect what &apos;s called a diffusion tensor imaging .
as almost mapping our interstate highways , if you will .
and we put them into what &apos;s basically a glorified meat slicer .
There &apos;s a blade here that &apos;s going to cut across
We &apos;re going to then apply one of those stains to it ,
And then what we get is our first mapping .
You could consider this state boundaries , if you will ,
From this , we &apos;re able to then fragment that brain into further pieces ,
which then we can put on a smaller cryostat .
This is 20 microns thin , so this is about a baby hair &apos;s width .
that &apos;s going to apply one of those stains to it .
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this .
So again this is what they can see under the microscope .
And from there it &apos;s routine . They understand where to make these assignments .
And they can make basically what &apos;s a reference atlas .
to go back to another piece of that tissue
You can see that blue dot there cutting . And that tissue falls off .
and then we put a florescent tag on it .
and we put it on to something called a microarray .
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,
is actually a unique piece of the human genome
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it ,
quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .
We &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus .
So each sample gets us about 50,000 data points
and I &apos;ll show you what that synthesis looks like .
that &apos;s all freely available to any scientist around the world .
They don &apos;t even have to log in to come use this tool ,
mine this data , find interesting things out with this .
You &apos;ll start to recognize these things from what we &apos;ve collected before .
There &apos;s an operator side on the right that allows you to turn ,
which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on .
are where a gene is turned on to a great degree .
Green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
And remember that we &apos;ve assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome
We &apos;re just starting to look at this data ourselves .
There &apos;s some basic things that you would want to understand .
So if you want to understand the action of drugs ,
you want to understand how they &apos;re acting in the ways you want them to ,
and also in the ways you don &apos;t want them to .
you want to see where those genes are turned on .
And for the first time , we can actually do that .
We can do that in multiple individuals that we &apos;ve assayed too .
We get confirmation that , indeed , the gene is turned on --
in serotonergic structures , things that are already known be affected --
but we also get to see the whole thing .
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before ,
It &apos;s as interesting a side effect as it could be .
One other thing you can do with such a thing
is you can , because it &apos;s a pattern matching exercise ,
an entire listing of what the genome has on offer
in the form of people covering in the news
saying , &quot; Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes
and they try to find hot spots of activity
But what you get out of such an exercise
It tells you the what , but it doesn &apos;t tell you the where .
and they can start to get clues about activity .
They can start to look at common pathways --
other things that they simply haven &apos;t been able to do before .
that even though we celebrate all of our differences ,
This is an example of a study that we did
to follow up and see what exactly those differences were --
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .
These are two genes that we found as good examples .
One is called RELN -- it &apos;s involved in early developmental cues .
that &apos;s telling us a gene is turned on there .
So I &apos;m going to leave you with a final note
But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
So here it is . You can check : I am short , I &apos;m French ,
so that &apos;s going to be clear in a moment .
And I suspect many of you probably gave something
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you &apos;ve raised --
and you have a budget to spend . You want to spend it on the poor :
that all we need to do is to spend money ?
Or do you believe the people who tell you that
aid is not going to help , on the contrary it might hurt ,
After all , we have spent billions of dollars on aid .
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example .
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress .
We have no idea . We don &apos;t know what the counterfactual is .
To give the aid , and hope and pray that something comes out of it ?
Sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
And the world has spent a lot of money on it :
are each pledging a lot of money towards it ,
and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort .
So this is what you call a &quot; last mile problem . &quot;
In fact , that is the leading cause of under-five mortality .
And , not only do they protect the people who sleep under them ,
If half of a community sleeps under a net ,
And yet , only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net .
or , for that matter , pay people to use them
or at least they &apos;re not going to use them as bed nets ,
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage ,
in order to make sure that they really value them ?
Maybe that &apos;s the solution , maybe we should send kids to school .
Do you hire teachers ? Do you build more schools ?
And in this way , you can take the guesswork
And I &apos;ll give you some examples with those three questions .
Now , it &apos;s not because the vaccines are not there --
and it &apos;s not because parents do not care about their kids .
The same child that is not immunized against measles ,
Well , part of the problem , surely , is people do not fully understand .
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized .
And maybe when you get there , what you find is this :
The subcenter is closed . Ao you have to come back ,
and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do ,
Well , if that &apos;s the problem , then that &apos;s much easier .
So these are simple ideas , but we didn &apos;t know .
So what we did is we did a randomized , controlled trial
We made it easy -- I &apos;ll tell you how in a moment .
by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization .
to do something that they don &apos;t want to do .
On the other hand , if your problem is you tend to postpone ,
then it might give you a reason to act today
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent .
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils ,
Now , you might say , &quot; Well , but it &apos;s not sustainable .
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway ,
ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don &apos;t .
Should you give them for free , or should you ask people to pay for them ?
One is : If people must pay for a bed net ,
because if we think people get used to handouts ,
it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets .
And many experiments have been run , and they all have the same results ,
so I &apos;m just going to talk to you about one .
could get the bed net in the local pharmacy .
when people have to pay for their bed nets ,
three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net ,
and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets ,
Well , the good news is , people , if they have the bed nets ,
will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it .
If they get it for free , they use it .
If they have to pay for it , they use it .
were actually more likely to purchase the second one
So people do not get used to handouts ; they get used to nets .
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .
So , that &apos;s for bed nets . So you will think , &quot; That &apos;s great .
You know how to immunize kids , you know how to give bed nets . &quot;
But what politicians need is a range of options .
They need to know : Out of all the things I could do ,
what is the best way to achieve my goals ?
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
There are so many things you could do . You could pay for uniforms ,
So , is that sufficient ? If we think they should work intuitively ,
Well , in business , that &apos;s certainly not the way we would go about it .
and with the same horseman and the same horse ,
to carry the goods on the horse carts , on the ground ,
So why shouldn &apos;t we do the same with social policy ?
so why aren &apos;t we doing that with social policy ?
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects ,
you get between one and three extra years of education .
Things that don &apos;t work so well is bribing parents ,
just because so many kids are already going to school
that you end up spending a lot of money .
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that ,
this is not what people would have gone for ,
We need that kind of information , we need more of it ,
So now , I started from the big problem , and I couldn &apos;t answer it .
and I have the answer to these smaller questions .
So let &apos;s go back to Haiti for a moment .
That doesn &apos;t sound like that much when you think about it .
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars
Well , I think what part of the problem is that ,
and they &apos;ll send in the doctors , and they &apos;ll send in the lumber ,
And the problem of poverty is not like that .
and third , we don &apos;t know whether we are doing the right thing .
I gave you three simple answers to three questions :
you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved .
Here &apos;s an example of how this can be powerful .
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .
And yet , when the young global leader in Davos
and the effort of many country governments and foundations ,
And now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question
whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference ,
but can we come back here in 30 years
I believe we can and I hope we will .
Welcome to Africa ! Or rather , I should say , welcome home .
Because this is where it all really began , isn &apos;t it ?
Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --
for the human species as we know it began right here .
We are on an amazing journey the next four days .
You &apos;re going to hear stories of &quot; Africa : The Next Chapter . &quot;
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment ,
and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .
What &apos;s the worst thing you &apos;ve ever heard about Africa ?
But this is about Africa , the story we have not heard .
and the stories that do exist about positive tales .
A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities
to separate the rhetoric from the reality , the fact from the fiction .
To go to the actual data and statistics that exist
about the actual things that are happening on the ground
that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you .
A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image ,
and how it takes control of its own destiny .
of what I have focused on for most of my professional career .
making the companies not just the best in Africa
when I was completing my MBA in the United States .
Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine .
And she said , &quot; I want to write a case , Euvin --
And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela .
that could have slid into the abyss of chaos .
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle .
became part of the research base for a chapter
And why I tell you this story is because later , when I was interviewed
on SABC Africa , on a pan-African broadcast , they asked ,
&quot; What is your key lesson , or the key thing you enjoy the most ? &quot; --
because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project .
The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --
that was used to share news with the rest of the world
of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds .
So I want to share with you a personal story
because in 1994 , I packed a few things into a backpack
But very soon , I found myself from the southern part of Africa ,
in South Africa -- at the very north , in Egypt .
I went to the Siwa Oasis . That was one of my stops .
And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things ,
but the key thing is that it was the place
when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him .
And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert .
Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm .
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle ,
So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers .
was the magical view of the sky at night .
With no natural light source , Siva is one of these amazing places
that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry .
And I see the same picture , but from the opposite side .
And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me
because I &apos;ll never forget it . I remember the very moment .
And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point .
The first thing that I saw was North America at night --
glowing , in all its glory . A warm feeling . Light .
And then I saw it -- Africa . Quite literally the &quot; Dark Continent . &quot;
the thing that brought the message home to me
was that this is the challenge we are facing ,
Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks
that exist north and in the south and other areas --
that , &quot; The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it . &quot;
So let &apos;s start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent
Africa is the second-largest continent , a landmass second from Asia .
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big
that you could fit in the continental United States ,
China , and the entire Europe into Africa , and still have space .
But you could say , &quot; Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages ,
As an investment banker , I &apos;m in the cross-flow of information
and the changes that are taking place in capital markets .
So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals , or signs ,
and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .
And let &apos;s start at the high level , on the macro-factors .
Inflation , in general , is coming down across Africa --
Zambia : from 2004 to 2006 , moves from the 18 percent in inflation
Egypt : from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent .
from the 16 percent to the eight percent . Single digits .
More fascinating , you have other countries -- South Africa ,
But that &apos;s just part of the story . You have a similar trend with currencies --
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country .
So the very definition -- to say &quot; invest in Africa &quot; is a no-go .
You can make money , you can lose money in Africa .
as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America .
And I &apos;m very proud and happy to be in that role
because it is a fascinating position to be in .
To hear this dialogue that &apos;s just increasing in tenor and velocity ,
of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come .
So the first port of call : let &apos;s talk a little bit about South Africa .
But not the South Africa we always talk about --
the gold , the minerals , the First World infrastructure --
For example , South Africa was recently voted as the top destination
for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers .
were Bain Capital and KKR , the big boys of private equity .
Headline in South Africa : &quot; They have landed . &quot; Quite ominous .
But what were they there for ? To acquire assets .
Bing Capital &apos;s acquisition of Edcon , a large retailer , is testimony
to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .
Being a retailer , it is a play on the belief
that this middle-class that &apos;s growing will continue to grow ,
that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue .
But the story of Africa , and my focus , is beyond South Africa
Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days .
But looking at Goldman Sachs &apos; work -- we had the famous BRIC Report .
The new report , &quot; The Next Eleven , &quot; highlights that by 2020
Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world .
What &apos;s going on in Nigeria ? A couple of things .
I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .
Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond
But the first Eurobond , the raising of international capital
that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy .
Looking at the oil industry , Africa provides 18 percent
of the U.S. &apos; s oil supply , with the Middle East just 16 percent .
2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --
the same league as Kuwait , the same league as Venezuela .
But with Africa , let &apos;s start being careful about this .
We have to move away from what &apos;s called &quot; the curse of the commodities . &quot;
Because it &apos;s not about oil , it &apos;s not about commodities .
and I &apos;m going to move through these very , very , very fast
Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone --
The announcement just came out the last few weeks .
So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse
in East Africa to get standards for organic produce . Better prices .
Again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
replanting and redeveloping their forests . Why is that important ?
As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed &#91; we will need &#93;
from over 80 banks to 25 banks . Strengthening of the system .
But what &apos;s going on there ? Only 10 percent of the country is banked .
There are only 700 ATMs in the country . Opportunity .
Now let &apos;s look at the continent as a whole .
People look at the roads , for example , and they &apos;d say ,
&quot; Angola : 90 percent of roads are untarred . Ah , problem ! &quot;
It &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . Prices of goods go up ,
Nigeria : 70 percent of roads are untarred . Zambia : 80 percent .
In general , more than 50 percent of roads are untarred .
This is an opportunity ! Energy needs -- it &apos;s an opportunity .
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing ?
If I had to ask you , &quot; In 2005 what was the best performing stock market
or stock exchange in the world ? &quot; Would Egypt come to mind ?
In 2005 , the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent .
What &apos;s going on in some of the other countries ?
Let &apos;s look at some 2006 numbers . Kenya : over 60 percent . Nigeria : over 40 percent .
But in any investment decision , the key question is ,
Because in Africa today , we are competing globally for capital .
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties .
There &apos;s an overhang of capital in the U.S. , and the key is yield pickup .
and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor
that &apos;s aware of what he or she is doing .
in the league of Ukraine and Turkey . Immediately we have a comparison .
Some other figures . South Africa : triple B-plus . Botswana : A-plus .
In fact , one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa .
Why are they doing that ? Because they expect investment to follow .
and one of my final points I want to mention , is
has launched their first African channel . Why is CNBC doing this ?
They &apos;re doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
Me and you , the investments we are going to be making ,
the investments the world is going to be making --
So that &apos;s the change that &apos;s coming down the pipeline .
So in conclusion , I want to turn back to that very slide
that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago .
This time &#91; I &apos;ll &#93; give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,
and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa ,
think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent .
In 1899 , Joseph Conrad released &quot; The Heart of Darkness , &quot;
a tale of grim horror along the Congo River .
is one of those bright lights . And that &apos;s the very Congo river
So the next step , over the next four days ,
And perchance , if you can always keep this picture in your mind ,
that when we convene maybe in the distant future , in 2020,
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic
So unlike traditional magic , it uses the power of words ,
and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you all how easy it is
to manipulate the human mind once you know how .
And I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody here .
I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me , first of all .
Now about half the audience has their left hand up . Why is that ?
OK , swap them around , put your right hand up .
OK , now , cross your hands over , so your right hand goes over ,
then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb --
Yours is the other way around , so swap it around .
Excellent , OK . Extend your fingers like this for me .
OK , now , if you did not allow me to deceive your minds ,
So , now you can see how easy it is
for me to manipulate the human mind , once you know how .
which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman
there &apos;s still people trying to do it here --
-- who could sense printed letters and even sense colors , just by touch .
She could also read the serial numbers on bills
when they were placed , face down , on a hard surface .
Now , I was fascinated , but at the same time , skeptical .
a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms ,
where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things .
And it &apos;s just a really weird thing to try and figure out .
Now earlier on , as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV ,
Keith Barry : Kathryn , it &apos;s Keith here . I &apos;m going to take you to a secret location , OK ?
Now , Kathryn , there was no way you could see through that blindfold , at all , through all that .
KT : OK , but don &apos;t say my name like that .
KB : There &apos;s no way you could have seen through it , agreed ?
KB : OK , I &apos;m just going to take it off . You &apos;re OK , you &apos;re OK .
Do you want to take off the other part of it ?
Go ahead and take it off , you &apos;re OK . We &apos;ll just stop for a second .
KT : I &apos;m so afraid of what I &apos;m going to see .
KB : No , no , you &apos;re fine , you &apos;re fine , take it off . You &apos;re OK . You &apos;re safe .
I &apos;m trying to see through your eyes . I can &apos;t see .
KB : Look at the road , look at the road .
KT : No , no , I &apos;m just still looking at the road .
That was the most scary thing I &apos;ve ever done in my life !
and we got a camera man in the back ,
but halfway through the drive , he told me he had a --
I think it was a nine-millimeter or something , stuck to his leg .
So , I stopped pretty quick , and that was it .
Now , most people here would automatically say no . OK ,
The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way .
So , I want you to just think about it for a moment .
with a logical solution to what just happened , all right .
But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception ,
will , 99 percent of the time , be way off the mark .
This is because magic is all about directing attention .
If , for instance , I didn &apos;t want you to look at my right hand ,
But if I wanted you to look at my right hand ,
Now , I &apos;m going to give you some demonstrations up here , live , right now .
I need two people to help me out real quick .
OK , give them a round of applause as they come up .
Now , it &apos;s very important for everybody here to realize
You don &apos;t know what &apos;s about to happen . Is that agreed ?
OK , would you mind just standing over here for a moment ?
KB : OK , oh . Tell them -- actually here &apos;s the thing ,
Can you stand over here ? This will just make it a little bit easier .
OK , that was a pity . I would have told them it was the ace of spades .
OK , a little bit closer , come over -- they look really nervous up here .
OK , now , do you believe in witchcraft at all ?
I want you to just stand exactly like this for me ,
because we &apos;re going to try a voodoo experiment right now .
I want you to be aware of the sensations ,
and don &apos;t open your eyes until I ask you .
KB : You did feel that ? What did you feel ?
KB : Twice . OK , extend your left arm out in front of you .
Be aware of the sensations , don &apos;t say anything , don &apos;t open your eyes , OK .
I just touched his back , and I just touched his arm .
Yeah , I walk around nightclubs all night like this .
You just take a seat over here for a second .
I &apos;m going to use you again , in a moment .
And can you take a seat right over here for me , if you don &apos;t mind .
Now , what I want you to do is look directly at me , OK ,
just take a deep breath in through your nose ,
I &apos;m merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity ,
I &apos;m going to take your left hand , and just place it up here .
And I want you to hold it there , just for a moment ,
and I only want you to allow your hand
to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop
as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness ,
and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .
I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop .
OK , now , in a moment , you &apos;ll feel a certain pressure , OK ,
and I want you to be aware of the pressure .
And I only want you to allow your hand
to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release ,
OK , and only when you feel the pressure go back ,
I want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop ,
OK , that was wonderfully done . Let &apos;s try it again .
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop , keep your eyes closed .
I want you to point directly at his forehead , OK .
Only when you want the pressure to be released ,
but only when you want the pressure to be released .
Only when you want the pressure released , we &apos;ll try it again .
And hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
Only when you want the pressure to go back , make a downward gesture .
You did it pretty quickly , but it went down , OK .
Now , I want you to be aware that in a moment ,
when I snap my fingers , your eyes will open , again .
It &apos;s OK to remember to forget , or forget to remember what happened .
Most people ask you , &quot; What the hell just happened up here ? &quot;
But it &apos;s OK that even though you &apos;re not hypnotized ,
On five , four , three , two , one -- open your eyes , wide awake .
I once saw a film called &quot; The Gods Are Crazy . &quot;
Do you remember when they threw the Coke bottle out of the airplane ,
and it landed on the ground , and it didn &apos;t break ?
sometimes the spoon will bend or melt , sometimes it will not .
Sometimes the object will slide across the table , sometimes it will not .
It depends on how much energy you have that day ,
We &apos;re going to try an experiment in psychokinesis , right now .
Make sure it is solid , there &apos;s only one hole , and it &apos;s a normal Coke bottle .
And you can whack it against the table , if you want .
OK , I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb .
Now , I &apos;ve got a shard of glass here , OK .
I want you to examine the shard of glass .
Be careful , because it is sharp . Just hold on to it for a moment .
I want you to imagine all the negative energy
But I want you to take this very seriously .
In a moment , you &apos;ll feel a certain sensation , OK ,
I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle .
Think of that guy , that ba -- that guy .
it might take a while -- drop it into the glass .
Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass .
And I want you to release that negative energy
That was a lot of negative energy , built up in there .
I also want you to think of his name . Look at me and think of his name .
OK , think of how many letters in the title of his name .
You didn &apos;t react to that , so it &apos;s four letters in the title .
Think of one of the letters in the title .
There &apos;s a K in his name , there is a K.
See the way I knew that , because my name starts with a K also ,
but his name doesn &apos;t start with a K , it starts with an M.
Tell Mike I said hello , the next time you see him .
I &apos;ve got one more thing to share with you right now .
Actually , Chris , I was going to pick you for this ,
but instead of picking you , can you hop up here
And it should be a male victim , that &apos;s the only thing .
KB : I was going to use you for this ,
but I decided I might want to come back another year .
KB : OK , Steve , I want you to take a seat , right behind here . Excellent .
They just , they insist that because I was a magician ,
Now , they &apos;re all the exact same except this one
obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it .
I want you to examine it , and make sure it &apos;s solid .
KB : OK . Now , Steve , I &apos;m going to stand in front of the table ,
OK . When I stand in front of the table ,
I want you to put the cups on the plinths , like this ,
in any order you want , and then mix them all up ,
so nobody has any idea where the spike is , all right ?
KB : No one in the audience . And just to help you out ,
I &apos;ll block them from view , so nobody can see what you &apos;re doing .
I &apos;ll also look away . So , go ahead and mix them up , now .
KB : Almost , oh . OK , you &apos;re making sure that &apos;s well hidden . Now --
oh , we &apos;ve got one here , we &apos;ve got one here .
But I don &apos;t want you to know either , so swivel around on your chair .
They &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure I don &apos;t do anything funny .
So , now you don &apos;t know where the spike is ,
and I don &apos;t know where it is either , OK .
Now , is there any way to see through this blindfold ?
KB : No , just , is there any way to see through it ?
Don &apos;t move the cups , because I don &apos;t want anybody to see where the spike is ,
and then line them up , like this , all right ?
My hand is at life , here , so -- at risk .
KB : OK , where are you ? Put out your hand .
KB : Now , Steve , do you think it &apos;s here ? Yes or no ?
KB : I told you I &apos;d have the last laugh .
Now , if I go this way , is there another cup over here ?
KB : Oh , no , no , no . He asked me could he do the left hand . Absolutely not .
KB : Now , if I go this way , is there another cup ?
KB : OK . Do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
Do you think the spike is under your left hand ,
Now , remember , you made all the decisions all along .
If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on ,
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
As an altar boy , I breathed in a lot of incense ,
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious
I want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality .
Would you like to see it ? I brought some with me .
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .
I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues .
But I countered , &quot; Well men &apos;s brains make this too .
But he was right , it was a stupid idea .
In other words , I thought I could design an experiment
And when it &apos;s produced , it has a three-minute half-life ,
So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin ,
have to grab it fast and keep it cold .
so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery .
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project .
that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; Are you trustworthy ? &quot;
is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money .
They all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
We give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them .
And in that pair , one person gets a message saying ,
&quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10
and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot;
or do you want to send some amount back ?
You &apos;re going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust ,
and the transfer from the second person back to the first
on why the second person would ever return any money .
We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money ,
we found that the more money the second person received ,
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .
So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin ,
I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain
and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust ,
we can more than double the number of people
who sent all their money to a stranger --
Yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
After they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings
and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .
that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason ,
So if I do something that hurts you , I feel that pain .
If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your joy .
Now this is the same Adam Smith who , 17 years later ,
would write a little book called &quot; The Wealth of Nations &quot; --
because it tells us how to turn up this behavior
you see lots of morality and immorality , let me tell you .
So one Sunday afternoon , a man walks into my cashier &apos;s booth
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
And he said , &quot; Hey , I was in the men &apos;s room .
I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;
We have to find the owner for this . &quot; I said , &quot; Yea . &quot;
So we &apos;re trying to decide what to do with this ,
&quot; I was in your gas station a while ago ,
and I bought this jewelry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you &apos;re saving my life . Here &apos;s my phone number .
I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 reward . &quot;
I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes ,
and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot;
Again he asked me , &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so nice , let &apos;s split the reward . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars ,
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop ,
is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him ,
and you &apos;re opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money .
So if you trust them , their brains don &apos;t release oxytocin .
If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all .
So there &apos;s a technical word for these people in my lab .
These are not people you want to have a beer with .
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .
and about half those don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus .
So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stressed out ,
There &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting --
So we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .
Now think about this . It means , within our own biology ,
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women ,
we have testosterone that makes us want to punish
We don &apos;t need God or government telling us what to do .
to see if this really holds in our daily lives .
So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England .
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice
And I took blood from the bride and the groom
and the wedding party and the family and the friends
but they do so in a very particular way .
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
So I think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ritual
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money
didn &apos;t really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
So even though I have a fear of heights ,
and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
And there are so many ways we can connect to people .
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
And one of these guys , he must have been 22,
I said , &quot; Look , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot;
but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .
So there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people ,
These are the most primitive people in the world .
and my favorite way to do it is , in fact , the easiest .
I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world ,
We have found that people who release more oxytocin
Of course , if you don &apos;t like to touch people , I can always shove this up your nose .
Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot;
Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is
I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage
And then I &apos;ll kind of be like -- -- and then they &apos;re like , &quot; Whoa ! &quot;
See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets --
so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes ,
Sometimes I startle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on ,
and then it goes like -- -- &quot; Oh ! &quot;
And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around
We &apos;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot;
and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions
And ... Well , I guess I could tell you
It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , L鑼卭n Theremin
-- he also was a musician besides an inventor --
he came up with the idea for making the theremin ,
I think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal -- it &apos;s like --
and he thought , &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound
and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot;
he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .
they &apos;ll make reference to a theremin by going , &quot; Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , &quot;
because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies ,
It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing --
because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance
with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time
you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ;
And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still
because little movements with other parts of your body
will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note -- --
If I pass out on the next song ...
like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware
of every little crazy thing your body is doing ,
or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing
while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like ,
And it &apos;s like , &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ;
I don &apos;t want to be like -- -- you know ? &quot;
It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also ,
and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ;
you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening
and realize you &apos;ll have bummer notes come here and there
and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on ,
or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
I &apos;m going to do &quot; Lush Life . &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
I &apos;m not quite sure whether I really want to see
a snare drum at nine o &apos;clock or so in the morning .
But anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater ,
of course , is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument
and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen .
And it sounds quite simple , but actually it &apos;s quite a big , big job .
Because you know , when you look at a piece of music -- for example ,
if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here , hopefully ,
a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
And , you know , we open it up and I read the music .
I will follow the instructions , the tempo markings , the dynamics .
if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . It &apos;s very straightforward .
But here I &apos;m being told that the piece of music is very quick .
I &apos;m being told where to play on the drum .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
So therefore , if I translate this piece of music , we have this idea .
And so on . My career would probably last about five years .
However , what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
Everything that there isn &apos;t time to learn from a teacher ,
But it &apos;s the things that you notice when you &apos;re not actually with your instrument
that in fact become so interesting , and that you want to explore
So there , we experience the translation . Now we &apos;ll experience the interpretation .
But in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if I look at you and I see
a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
I see that you &apos;re clutching a teddy bear , etc . , etc .
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like ,
what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
However , that &apos;s just , you know , the initial idea I may have that we all get
when we actually look , and we try to interpret ,
In the same way , I look at the music ; I get a basic idea ;
I wonder what technically might be hard , or , you know , what I want to do .
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen , listen .
We have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
If I play , for example , holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick --
you &apos;ll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm .
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not --
even though I &apos;m actually holding the stick quite tightly .
By holding it tightly , I feel strangely more detached .
If I just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system ,
suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort . Much more .
And I just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument ,
I need time with people in order to interpret them .
If , for example , I play just a few bars of a piece of music
for which I think of myself as a technician --
that is , someone who is basically a percussion player ...
And so on . If I think of myself as a musician ...
And so on . There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just --
And I remember when I was 12 years old ,
and I started playing tympani and percussion , and my teacher said ,
&quot; Well , how are we going to do this ? You know , music is about listening . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , I agree with that . So what &apos;s the problem ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , how are you going to hear this ? How are you going to hear that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , I think I hear it through here . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands ,
through my arms , cheekbones , my scalp , my tummy , my chest , my legs and so on . &quot;
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums --
to such a narrow pitch interval , so something like ...
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
and it &apos;s amazing that when you do open your body up ,
and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through ,
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger , there .
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall
of the music room , and together we would &quot; listen &quot; to the sounds of the instruments ,
far , far more broadly than simply depending on the ear .
Because of course , the ear is , I mean , subject to all sorts of things .
The room we happen to be in , the amplification , the quality of the instrument ,
And that &apos;s basically what we are . We &apos;re just human beings ,
but we all have our own little sound colors , as it were ,
And as I grew older , I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London ,
and they said , &quot; Well , no , we won &apos;t accept you , because we haven &apos;t a clue ,
you know , of the future of a so-called &apos; deaf &apos; musician . &quot;
And so therefore , I said to them , &quot; Well , look , if you refuse --
as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love
then we have to think very , very hard about the people you do actually accept . &quot;
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle , and having to audition twice --
what had happened was that it changed the whole role
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of
they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
And every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then
based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not .
So therefore , this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting
bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .
And I have to say , many of them now
The interesting thing about this as well , though --
is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound --
which is basically all of us , and we well know that music really is our daily medicine .
Because you know , some of the extraordinary things I &apos;ve experienced
as a musician , when you may have a 15-year-old lad
who may not be able to control his movements ,
who may be deaf , who may be blind , etc . , etc . --
suddenly , if that young lad sits close to this instrument ,
and you play something that &apos;s so incredibly organ-like , almost --
I don &apos;t really have the right sticks , perhaps --
but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn &apos;t be ,
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows
wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few rows wouldn &apos;t experience either .
Every single one of us , depending on where we &apos;re sitting ,
And of course , being the participator of the sound ,
and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce --
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
In the same way that when I see tree moves ,
then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound .
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
I mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience ,
and not by learning a piece of music , putting on someone else &apos;s interpretation of it ,
buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music , and so on and so forth .
Because that isn &apos;t giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic ,
and something that I can fully experience the journey of .
So it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work .
It may be that in other halls , they &apos;re simply not going to experience that
at all and so therefore , my level of soft ,
Do you see what I mean ? So , because of this explosion in access to sound ,
how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy --
But it &apos;s meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls
they put together . There are so few halls in this world
dare I say . But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
The tiniest , softest , softest sound to something that is so broad ,
it may sound good up there , may not be so good there .
Maybe terrible over there , but not too bad there , etc . , etc .
-- for which you can play exactly what you imagine ,
And so therefore , acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are
I cannot , you know , give you any detail as far as what is actually happening
with those halls , but it &apos;s just the fact that they are going to a group of people
&quot; Well , how on Earth can they experience music ? You know , they &apos;re deaf . &quot;
We just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
Or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what blindness is about .
If we see someone in a wheelchair , we assume they cannot walk .
It may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . That , to them , means they can walk .
In a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
it &apos;s unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills ,
to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber , to stop the judgment .
For me , as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music ,
it &apos;s very easy for me to say , &quot; Oh yes , I like that piece .
Oh no , I don &apos;t like that piece . &quot; And so on .
And you know , I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time .
It may be that the chemistry isn &apos;t quite right between myself and that particular piece of music ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean I have the right to say it &apos;s a bad piece of music .
And you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician ,
So there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this .
If I can just say , &quot; Please clap and create the sound of thunder . &quot;
I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .
And please try to create that through your clapping . Try . Just -- please try .
Very good ! Snow . Snow . Have you ever heard snow ?
Evelyn Glennie : Well then , stop clapping . Try again .
You know , the interesting thing here , though , is that I asked a group of kids
However , not one of you got out of your seats to think ,
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds . &quot;
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way
other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .
In the same way that when we listen to music ,
we assume that it &apos;s all being fed through here .
This is how we experience music . Of course it &apos;s not .
We experience thunder -- thunder , thunder . Think , think , think .
Listen , listen , listen . Now -- what can we do with thunder ?
I remember my teacher . When I first started , my very first lesson ,
I was all prepared with sticks , ready to go .
And instead of him saying , &quot; OK , Evelyn , please , feet slightly apart ,
arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle , sticks in a more-or-less V shape ,
Please keep your back straight , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot; --
where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid , frozen ,
and I would not be able to strike the drum ,
because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said ,
&quot; Evelyn , take this drum away for seven days , and I &apos;ll see you next week . &quot;
So , heavens ! What was I to do ? I no longer required the sticks ;
I had to basically look at this particular drum ,
see how it was made , what these little lugs did , what the snares did .
Turned it upside down , experimented with the shell , experimented with the head .
And of course , I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that --
because then , where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ?
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book ?
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
So for example , one of the things that we learn
when we are dealing with being a percussion player , as opposed to a musician ,
Like that . And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
And so on and so forth . What does this piece require ?
Single stroke rolls . So why can &apos;t I then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?
And interestingly , the older I became , and when I became a full-time student
at a so called &quot; music institution , &quot; all of that went out of the window .
And constantly , the question , &quot; Well , why ? Why ? What is this relating to ?
I need to play a piece of music . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , this will help your control ! &quot;
&quot; Well , how ? Why do I need to learn that ? I need to relate it to a piece of music .
Is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? Why am I doing that ?
and the reason has to be by saying something through the music . &quot;
And by saying something through music , which basically is sound ,
we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
But I don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
That &apos;s up to you , when you walk through a hall .
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things .
I may feel sorrowful , or happy , or exhilarated , or angry when I play
So please , the next time you go to a concert ,
just allow your body to open up , allow your body to be this resonating chamber .
Be aware that you &apos;re not going to experience the same thing as the performer is .
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound ,
because they &apos;re hearing the contact of the stick on the drum ,
or the mallet on the bit of wood , or the bow on the string , etc . ,
or the breath that &apos;s creating the sound from wind and brass .
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike ,
or breath , is being pulled . Just experience the whole journey of that sound
in the same way that I wished I &apos;d experienced the whole journey
of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses .
These kids on the Internet , they have this group of kids
Tom Green : Yeah . And they &apos;ve been dogging me for a year .
I got to tell you , it &apos;s driving me nuts , actually .
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream ,
And so what I did is I took it , I translated it into English ,
and I stuck it up for my friends to use .
There &apos;s no archive , there are no barriers , there &apos;s no registration .
is it &apos;s fostered the creation of a lot of
Internet phenomena , viral videos and whatnot , known as &quot; memes . &quot;
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site
some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --
and you get an &apos; 80s pop song . That &apos;s all it was .
And it got big enough to the point where
there was a float last year at the Macy &apos;s Thanksgiving Day parade ,
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream ,
We do ; they &apos;re the codified rules that I &apos;ve come up with ,
And so they &apos;ve come up with their own set of rules ,
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically .
&quot; If it exists , there is porn of it . No exceptions . &quot;
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .
not just the memes they &apos;ve created , but the exploits .
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago ,
and the Internet got wind of it . My community
I didn &apos;t instruct them to do it ; they just decided that that &apos;s what they wanted .
And so , you know , 390 percent approval rating ain &apos;t so bad .
It &apos;s that they weren &apos;t putting me at the top of this list ;
it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed
The amount of time and effort that went into that
it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized .
Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise . It went up online .
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet .
organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --
So we &apos;ve got this activist group that &apos;s this grassroots group
And last , I &apos;m going to show you the example ,
Dusty is the name that we &apos;ve given to this cat .
And , you know , this didn &apos;t sit well with people ,
So what they did is they -- I mean , they put CSI to shame here --
They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video .
We &apos;re sacrificing a lot of that , and I think in doing so ,
But if I ask them , is the TED website going to go down ?
CA : Well , you never know . Some of them --
we &apos;ve got people in 75 countries out there watching .
You &apos;ve had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
is being served here by just allowing people --
there are very few places , now , where you can go
And saying whatever you like , I think , is powerful .
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line .
But I think it &apos;s important to have these places .
When I get emails , people say , &quot; Thank you for giving me this place ,
you know , can be constructive ; it can be really damaging .
And if you cut the link between what is said
I mean , surely there are huge risks with that .
CA : Tell me about what -- I mean , I think you asked the board
because I can &apos;t read to you anything that they said , more or less .
But there were some good things that came out of that too .
CA : And that content is all off the board now .
Right , it &apos;s gone ? Or is it still up there ?
CP : I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
Now , I &apos;m not sure I would have necessarily recommended
everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway .
Chris , you yourself ? I mean , you &apos;re a figure of some intrigue .
but it &apos;s not making you a lot of money , yet .
CP : The commercial picture is that there really isn &apos;t
I mean , obviously , it &apos;s got some very offensive , obscene content on it ,
And when you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;ve pretty much sacrificed
CP : I got out of Mom &apos;s , and I &apos;m back in school right now .
CA : But what conversations did you or do you
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
But my parents -- I think part of why
CA : And they were probably pleased to see you
CP : Yeah . They still didn &apos;t know what to think of that though .
As I said , I just went back to school ,
kind of taking whatever I &apos;ve learned from online communities
CA : Chris , thank you . Absolutely fascinating . Thank you for coming to TED .
And although we know that the land animals I &apos;m going to talk about
are just the scum of the Earth on the land --
the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us
because they &apos;re sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters .
radiated out to take their place . And so , we know this
in extraordinary detail . And so this is a core
from near Bermuda . We know that the tsunamis , the earthquakes ,
can &apos;t really quite get around the kind of disaster
even before scientists in general came to an agreement
scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes
Mesozoic , the middle life , and the Cenozoic , the recent life .
And as it turns out , it actually corresponds really nicely
and a Cenozoic period , an age of reconnection --
And so my work , really , is trying to understand
to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals
I mean , certainly mammals did . This is one example .
You can go outside -- see many other examples .
Within five , 10 million years of the bolide impact
we had a whole variety of animals going into the water . Why didn &apos;t they do that ?
Why didn &apos;t they hang around in trees at good size ,
Why didn &apos;t they do all these things , and if they didn &apos;t do all these things ,
And if there were no animals in those spaces , what does that tell us
Really interesting questions . I think a lot of it has to do with body size .
In fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size --
and studying it , digging it up for many years ,
and it seems as though everything is quick time , just like technology ,
an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
the time it took to reach maximum body size ?
but we &apos;re interested in the time it took them to achieve that .
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals
the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we &apos;ve made ,
and many other scholars have made around the world .
This slide was shown before . This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx .
We now know this transition is the one time
we &apos;re going to see where they began in a minute --
and it is the one time that they rapidly
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series
that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature .
We called this bird Sinornis . It &apos;s a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx ,
and if you go to different layers , you find things
that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx , and every grade in between ,
so that if you find something today , we &apos;re usually splitting hairs --
or , more appropriately , feathers -- as to decide whether it &apos;s actually
It is the greatest transition that we have , actually ,
It is really our greatest -- one of our greatest -- evolutionary sequences .
I thought if I &apos;m going to understand dinosaur evolution ,
where they had picked up fragments , go back to a time and a place
I &apos;d like to call for this little video clip
to give you some idea of , sort of , what we face . Normally , we get asked a lot of questions :
&quot; Well , how do you find fossils in areas that look like this ? &quot;
And we &apos;re coming over a cliff , and at the top of that cliff ,
At the bottom of the cliff , we find that they &apos;re rare as hens &apos; teeth .
That &apos;s where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
You go into an area like this , you get a geologic map ,
and the best , most-inspired team you can bring to the area .
And the rest is up to you . You &apos;ve got to find fossils .
You &apos;ve got to dig a hole that &apos;s usually quite a bit bigger than that
to get it out ; you &apos;ve got to climb those cliffs
not just the dinosaurs , but the entire story . If you &apos;re lucky ,
you actually find the ash bed to dig it , and we did .
or your kids know , at least , on four legs .
This is sort of a look at the skull ,
and it &apos;s an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long .
That &apos;s where dinosaurs began . That &apos;s where the radiation began .
than the mammal radiation , which was a four-legged radiation .
and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers , as they are --
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents ,
because it was those continents that are least explored .
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally ,
you really have to force yourself to go down
I &apos;ve been to some of those continents , but Africa was ,
in the words of Steven Pinker , was a blank slate , largely .
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle ,
There &apos;s no roads into the Sahara . It &apos;s an enormous place .
the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara
and take them out , you really have to put together
Some of them are political . Many of them are physical .
Some of them -- the most important -- are mental .
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions --
people who understand science as adventure with a purpose .
Your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport --
your job as a leader is to try to inspire them
to do more work than they &apos;ve ever done in their life
So , you can &apos;t leave your normal metal tools out
because you &apos;ll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes .
So , you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .
These are the Tuareg nomads , and they &apos;re living their lives
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground ,
To do that , you &apos;ve got to actually transport them
We &apos;re talking about Ethiopia , but let &apos;s talk about Niger --
or Niger , in our English language -- north of Nigeria --
when we started working there , did not have container traffic .
onto a boat , if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara .
and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs
that you saw buried there -- 20 tons of material --
a sauropod dinosaur like we haven &apos;t seen on some other continents .
It really is a little bit out of place temporally .
if we dug in contemporary beds in North America .
a whole menagerie . When you pick up something like this --
and some of you have had the chance to touch it --
this is a piece of history . You &apos;re touching something that &apos;s 110 million years old .
This is a thumb claw . There it was , moments after it was discovered .
and it really began when we began to understand
It &apos;s only been with us for less than a century ,
when radioactive dating came about , less than a century ago ,
and we could actually tell how old some of these things were ,
because it changes the way we look at ourselves
When you pick up a piece of history like that ,
That &apos;s the animal that thumb claw came from : Suchomimus .
This is something we found in Morocco , an immense animal .
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal .
This was the cover of Science , because they thought
but we can see by some in our administration
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of --
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent ,
It has no big claw on its hind foot . It doesn &apos;t look like a Velociraptor .
So what we &apos;re trying to piece together here is a story .
and that &apos;s a nasty one we haven &apos;t named yet .
And huge things -- I mean , this is a
Now , this field is just -- and , of course , science in general -- is just -- adventure .
Man : Look at that set of choppers ! Yeah , he &apos;s a big one .
Man : OK , hand me some more here . Man 2 : OK .
Narrator : It falls to Paul to cover its eyes .
Man : Watch out ! Watch out ! No , no , no , no . You &apos;re going to have to get on the back legs .
Man 2 : You have the back legs ? No , you have the front legs , my friend .
Paul Sereno : Let &apos;s get this tape measure on him . Put it right there .
Man : Enormous . PS : You &apos;ve got a ... 14-foot croc .
PS : Don &apos;t get off . You don &apos;t get off , but don &apos;t worry about me .
PS : Don &apos;t get off ! Don &apos;t get off ! Don &apos;t get off !
Narrator : Paul has never seen a fossil do that .
Well , you know , the -- the fossil record is truly amazing
because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way .
It depended on the shape of their skull , though ,
to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world
that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile , probably a male .
I &apos;m going to lead an expedition to the Sahara
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara
waiting for us to go back . So , really exciting .
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet .
Now , we normally think of Tibet as a highland .
No one &apos;s found them . We know where they are ,
and we &apos;re going to go and get them next year .
but if you go in the warm part of the year , it &apos;s O.K.
Now , I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history
I &apos;ve talked about a few of them . We really need to take that further .
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy
to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means .
We can &apos;t predict , necessarily , what will happen in evolution ,
but we can learn some of the rules of the game ,
These are all landlubbing animals . There &apos;s a couple of choices .
from one to the other and erase that division ,
and you survive on the other side and create a difference .
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other
of those three things , but the paleontologist never found you .
And so , in addition to digging , I think we have some answers
from the dinosaur record . I think these dinosaurs migrated --
we call it dispersal -- around the globe , with the slightest land bridge .
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole ,
But when they were divided , indeed they were divided ,
But there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s even more important , and I think that &apos;s extinction .
The best way to test this is to actually create a model .
So if we move back , this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life .
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time .
Now we have divergence over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
We can control those things that we &apos;re worried about :
to mimic what we think the continents were like ,
and run it a thousand times , so we can estimate the parameters ,
to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not ,
at least to know the barriers of the problems . So that &apos;s a little bit about the science .
Today I &apos;m going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here
talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago ,
which is related to the fact that I never --
and actually , in talking to a lot of TEDsters ,
there &apos;s a number of you out there -- I don &apos;t know that I &apos;d get an answer
honestly , if I asked you to raise your hand ,
but there are a number of you out there that started your
as failures , by society &apos;s standards , as failures by schools .
I was one of those . I was failed by my school -- my school failed me .
I was a total failure in school , not really headed to graduate high school .
And I went on -- that &apos;s my first painting on canvas .
I worked up a portfolio , and I was headed to New York .
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there .
Something was going on in the background . I headed to New York to a studio .
I took a side trip to the American Museum , and I never recovered .
But really it &apos;s the same discipline -- they &apos;re kindred disciplines .
in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it
I give you a human face because you &apos;re experts at that .
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs .
who are least represented in our science and technology spheres .
We all know , and there &apos;s been several allusions to it ,
that we are failing in our ability to produce
We &apos;ve known that for a long time . We &apos;ve gone through the Sputnik phase ,
it becomes even more prominent . Where are all these people going to come from ?
And a more general question for our society is ,
what &apos;s going to happen to all the rest that are left behind ?
What about all the kids like me that were in school --
that were in school and didn &apos;t get a chance and will never get a chance
Those are the questions I ask . And we talk about Ethiopia , and it &apos;s very important .
What do you want to do ? And they gave them two problems .
and we will attract tourists , which is our number two industry .
And I hope to God the United States government , me , or TED ,
or somebody helps us do that , because that would be an incredible thing for their country .
But when we look back at our own country , we &apos;re looking back at our cities ,
the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city I come from --
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries --
as to how we get these kids involved in science .
We met them in their early stages in high school . They were --
and they are now -- one at the University of Chicago , another in Illinois .
We &apos;ve got students at Harvard . We &apos;re six years old .
Because when you go out there as a scholar , and you try to find out longitudinal studies ,
track records like that , there essentially are very few , if none .
So , we &apos;ve created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation ,
90 percent of those choosing science as a career .
It &apos;s an impressive track record , and so we look back and we say ,
well , we didn &apos;t really exactly work this out theoretically from the start ,
but when we look back , there are theoretical movements in science education .
and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist .
You have to have those steps . If you have --
It &apos;s hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist ,
which involves standing up in front of people like we &apos;re doing here at this symposium
and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist
And so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . We &apos;re planning a permanent home in Chicago .
We have lots of ideas , but I guarantee you this one thing --
and I &apos;ve talked to some people here at TED --
it &apos;s not going to look like anything you &apos;ve seen before .
I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us
and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars .
But robots are still not in our home , ironically .
certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us
For me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
And so that year , I started to build this robot , Kismet ,
working with other graduate students in the lab --
Scientist : This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me .
Scientist : Yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too .
like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child ,
which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind .
to tap into something deeply social within us --
and with that , the promise of an entirely new way
I &apos;ve been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots ,
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio .
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo .
And because it &apos;s new , Leo doesn &apos;t really know what to make of it .
But sort of like us , he can actually learn about it
might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start ,
And with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine
But what do I mean when I say &quot; push our social buttons ? &quot;
is that , if we design these robots to communicate with us
the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --
like Nexi , our humanoid robot , is doing here --
what we find is that people respond to robots
People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is ,
that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool
To answer questions like , how is it that , from a brief encounter ,
we &apos;re able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is ?
Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters ?
to learn this or understand this from watching people
because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically .
We can &apos;t carefully control them because they &apos;re subconscious for us .
this is a video taken from David DeSteno &apos;s lab at Northeastern University .
And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is
because it turns out people just behave like people
For instance , if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues ,
maybe they would be a cool , new communication technology .
You call your friend , she puts her handset in a robot ,
you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends ,
maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
where we brought human participants , people , into our lab
like looking at a set of objects on the table ,
discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --
of how valuable and important they thought they were .
The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group
The next was to add mobility -- so , have the screen on a mobile base .
This is like , if you &apos;re familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --
we asked people to rate their quality of interaction
through this technology , in a number of different ways .
how much empathy did you feel for the other person ?
And this is what we see when they use just the screen .
It turns out , when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --
And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression .
Now let &apos;s try to put this into a little bit of context .
Today we know that families are living further and further apart ,
and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships
and I want them to have a really good relationship
so they just don &apos;t get to see each other that often .
but my boys are little -- they don &apos;t really want to talk ;
So I love the idea of thinking about robots
I imagine a time not too far from now --
open up a browser and jack into a little robot .
I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays
and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house ,
over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese ,
and now it &apos;s a big problem with our children as well .
And we know that as you get older in life ,
if you &apos;re obese when you &apos;re younger , that can lead to chronic diseases
but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system .
a kind of friendly , supportive presence that &apos;s always there
to be able to help you make the right decision
So we actually explored this idea in our lab .
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work .
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach .
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do .
It could share information looking down at a screen .
And then it could help track that for you .
And it would build a working alliance with you
It could help you set goals and track your progress ,
does the social embodiment really matter ? Does it matter that it &apos;s a robot ?
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters ?
where we put one of three interventions in people &apos;s homes
One case was the robot you saw there , Autom .
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ,
And the third was just a pen and paper log ,
So one of the things we really wanted to look at
but really how long they interacted with the robot .
Because the challenge is not losing weight , it &apos;s actually keeping it off .
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions ,
So the first thing I want to look at is how long ,
It turns out that people interacted with the robot
even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer .
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance ,
And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study ,
they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots .
The last thing I want to talk about today
We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today ,
My sons , they love the screen . They love the screen .
But I want them to play ; as a mom , I want them to play ,
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today
that &apos;s really trying to think about how we can take
where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play .
CB : -- the character itself could come into your world ?
when the character becomes real and enters into their world .
they can relate to it and play with it in a way
that &apos;s fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .
So changes that children make in the real world
So here , Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2 .
give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world .
So they are now sending the character back into that world .
And then finally , what I &apos;ve been trying to do here
where they really feel like they are part of that story ,
the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching &quot; Star Wars . &quot;
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination
to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space
I really want to come up with new ways of children &apos;s media
We &apos;ve invited a lot of kids into this space ,
But I can tell you , the thing that they love the most
Running -- it &apos;s basically just right , left , right , left -- yeah ?
I mean , we &apos;ve been doing it for two million years ,
that hasn &apos;t been said and performed better a long time ago .
But the cool thing about running , as I &apos;ve discovered ,
Case in point : A couple months ago , if you saw the New York City Marathon ,
she hasn &apos;t won a marathon of any kind in eight years ,
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport ,
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu -- some other people had the same idea ,
The gun goes off , and she &apos;s not even an underdog .
Paula Radcliffe , the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck
suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back .
So we all know what to do in this situation , right ?
You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow
says , &quot; Come on . Come with us . You can do it . &quot;
And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her .
So that &apos;s a fantastic story , and we all know how it ends .
but she goes home with something bigger and more important .
instead of losing , she blazes past the lead pack and wins ,
you &apos;ve got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there .
When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate
than anybody else in the race , again , it &apos;s not a coincidence .
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills ;
Someone with that kind of heart , there &apos;s some kind of connection there .
can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico ,
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices :
you either fight back and engage or you could take off .
which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs .
is , deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --
is that all the things that we &apos;re going to be talking about today ,
all the things that we &apos;re trying to come up with
using all of our technology and brain power to solve --
and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression --
all this stuff , the Tarahumara don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
there &apos;s got to be some kind of cause and effect there .
that are bending their brains to try to figure out
They &apos;re trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries .
And once again , a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery --
perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara
is wrapped in three other mysteries , which go like this :
three things -- if you have the answer , come up and take the microphone ,
And if you know it , then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth .
Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size .
you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy .
In other words , early humans are eating dead animals --
the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago .
because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle .
Every other animal is stronger than we are --
they have fangs , they have claws , they have nimbleness , they have speed .
We think Usain Bolt is fast . Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel .
That would be an Olympic event : turn a squirrel loose --
whoever catches the squirrel , you get a gold medal .
So no weapons , no speed , no strength , no fangs , no claws --
how were we killing these animals ? Mystery number one .
Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now ,
but one thing that &apos;s remarkable about all women sprinters --
The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4 : 15 .
I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy
For some reason you guys are just really slow .
But you get to the marathon we were just talking about --
you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years .
medical science said that if a woman tried to run 26 miles --
does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run 26 miles ,
why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s ?
The uterus would fall out , literally fall out of the body .
So it &apos;s only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon .
up to the fact that you &apos;re only 10 minutes off
into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans --
remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles --
You can take a runner like Ann Trason , or Nikki Kimball , or Jenn Shelton ,
you put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world
and it &apos;s a coin toss who &apos;s going to win .
A couple years ago , Emily Baer signed up for a race
which tells you all you need to know about the race .
They give you 48 hours to finish this race .
she finishes in eighth place , in the top 10,
even though she stopped at all the aid stations
At the University of Utah , they started tracking finishing times
is that , if you start running the marathon at age 19,
until eventually you &apos;re back to running the same speed you were at age 19 .
So about seven years , eight years to reach your peak ,
You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed ,
are running as fast as they were at age 19 .
Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity --
and please don &apos;t say golf -- something that actually is hard --
someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer ,
you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it .
If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle ,
suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture .
If you wonder , why it is the Tarahumara don &apos;t fight
can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive ,
as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe ,
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness --
again , it &apos;s not our fangs and our claws and our speed --
the only thing we do really , really well is sweat .
Better than any other mammal on Earth , we can sweat really well .
is the fact that , when it comes to running
and after about five or six miles , that horse has a choice .
It &apos;s either going to breathe or it &apos;s going to cool off ,
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals ?
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world
was the fact that we could get together as a group ,
go out there on that African Savannah , pick out an antelope
and go out as a pack and run that thing to death ?
We could run really far on a hot day .
Well if that &apos;s true , a couple other things had to be true as well .
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word &quot; pack . &quot;
If you go out by yourself , and you try to chase an antelope ,
I guarantee you there &apos;s going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah .
who have been doing this for a long time
to understand which antelope you &apos;re actually trying to catch .
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .
You need to have the women and the adolescents there
because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein
is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent .
It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead
and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away .
You need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers
Another thing that has to be true about this pack : this pack cannot be really materialistic .
You can &apos;t be hauling all your crap around , trying to chase the antelope .
You can &apos;t be a pissed-off pack . You can &apos;t be bearing grudges ,
He pissed me off . Let him go chase his own antelope . &quot;
The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego ,
exactly what all of us had done for two million years ,
that it &apos;s us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path .
You know , we look at running as this kind of alien , foreign thing ,
this punishment you &apos;ve got to do because you ate pizza the night before .
Maybe we &apos;re the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had
How do we spoil it ? Well how do we spoil anything ?
We try to can it and package it and make it &quot; better &quot;
The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes
is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt .
And I think that , if anybody in here runs --
we talked for two minutes backstage , and she &apos;s talking about plantar fasciitis .
You talk to a runner , I guarantee , within 30 seconds ,
So if humans evolved as runners , if that &apos;s our one natural advantage ,
why are we so bad at it ? Why do we keep getting hurt ?
is that the running injury is new to our time .
any kind of myths , any kind of tall tales ,
with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor .
that running has become associated with fear and pain .
that , &quot; My only friends are my legs . I only trust my legs . &quot;
used to be you &apos;d run 50 miles across the desert ,
engage in hand-to-hand combat , steal a bunch of horses
my achilles -- I &apos;m tapering . I got to take this week off , &quot;
We are here today . We have our digital technology .
which was just rely on their naked feet and legs
So how do we get back to that again ?
Well , I would submit to you the first thing is
get rid of all packaging , all the sales , all the marketing .
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness
one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time .
So you burn off the Haagen-Dazs from the night before ?
that &apos;s going to make them more relaxed , more serene ,
where you don &apos;t come back into your office a raging maniac anymore ,
where you don &apos;t go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again .
I don &apos;t say let &apos;s go back to the Copper Canyons
and live on corn and maize , which is the Tarahumara &apos;s preferred diet ,
maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there .
that we all enjoyed for most of our existence ,
So what I &apos;ve been seeing today is there is a growing subculture
of barefoot runners , people who got rid of their shoes .
you get rid of the shoes , you get rid of the stress ,
you get rid of the injuries and the ailments .
the Tarahumara have known for a very long time ,
that this can be a whole lot of fun .
I was injured all my life , and then in my early 40s I got rid of my shoes
So hopefully it &apos;s something we can all benefit from .
And I appreciate you guys listening to this story . Thanks very much .
I &apos;m a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums .
but I also make television programs , books and some advertising ,
And it &apos;s about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture ,
I &apos;m going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago ,
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain
and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way .
could one erase the image of Diana , actually quite crudely and physically ?
So , I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana ,
and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche .
The press wrote about her death in rather , I felt , pornographic ways --
like , &quot; Which bit of artery left which bit of body ? &quot;
and &quot; How did she die in the back of the car ? &quot; --
and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism ,
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image ,
and posed her in the right positions and angles
and created something that was in , or existed in , the public imagination .
So people were wondering : was she going to marry Dodi ?
So I created this image of Diana , Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child
and this image came out , which caused a huge public outcry at the time .
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery ,
so I started making reference to media imagery --
made it grainy , shot through doorways and so on and so forth --
in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .
So , this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband ,
And this gets shown in art galleries like this , as a sequence .
I &apos;m particularly interested in how you can &apos;t rely on your own perception .
and I &apos;m fascinated how what you think is real isn &apos;t necessarily real .
with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths .
So , I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us
and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter .
And at the same time , it removes us from the real subject matter ,
and this acts as a sort of titillating thing .
So , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ;
And that is the way , I think , that celebrity magazines work now :
Of course , the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
In England there &apos;s an expression : &quot; you can &apos;t imagine the Queen on the loo . &quot;
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss
and I was cited as a disgusting artist . The press were writing about this ,
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle :
and about how we know facts and information only by media --
very few of us know the real people --
So , these are broadsheets , tabloids , debates were being had all about this work ,
films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work ,
Then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
I was being asked and paid to do front covers .
journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me ,
and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me .
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers .
This was , for example , an image that went into Tatler .
It was an April fool actually , and to this day some people think it &apos;s real .
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,
and they were saying there &apos;s this great image of the Queen
I was exploring , at the time , the hyperbole of icons --
and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives .
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .
I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley , I think , in this one . .
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn --
and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,
and only showing certain angles to create a reality that , obviously ,
This is the look-alike , so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous .
but by the time we &apos;ve made her up and put wigs and makeup on ,
to the extent that her husband couldn &apos;t recognize her --
So , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time .
Stills from the TV series went into this book .
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real ,
Because obviously it &apos;s making a comment about our culture right now :
How do we know when we &apos;re looking at something whether it &apos;s real or not ?
So , from my point of view , it &apos;s important to publish it ,
but at the same time it does cause a confusion --
but problematic for any outlet that I &apos;m working with .
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do ,
and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities
You know , what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru ?
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about
Bin Laden , Saddam Hussein , the links that were put about pre-Iraq war .
And what is going to happen to the monarchy ?
I think , would prefer William to Charles on the throne .
And it &apos;s that wish , or that desire , that I suppose I &apos;m dealing with in my work .
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes , which is Coca-Cola ,
and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities .
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork ;
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way
and that the integrity of the work remained the same .
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on ,
you &apos;re closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product
When you take the logo off , you &apos;re opening up the interpretations
because I think we made it three years ago .
And it &apos;s Camilla in her wedding dress , which , again ,
nearly got re-used now , recently prior to her wedding .
Tony Blair and Cherie . And again , the legalities -- we had to be very careful .
It &apos;s obviously a very big commercial company , and so this little ,
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them ,
so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes --
So , it &apos;s Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech ;
I &apos;ve got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin ;
Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson , who he was having an affair with at that time .
because the imagery got shown in the press the day after
It was a bit of a road stopper , which was problematic
because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds ,
but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance .
so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly , all this imagery .
And the press were interviewing , and I was signing my book . .
Further imagery . I &apos;m making a new book now with Taschen
that I &apos;m working on really for a sort of global market --
my previous book was only for the U.K. market --
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background
And I think it doesn &apos;t really matter that my work is considered humorous , in a way ;
I think it &apos;s a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery
and how we read all our information through imagery .
because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private ,
and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein , and George Bush
And then you change the photograph he &apos;s shooting at ,
and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible . .
and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind ,
And also , commenting on the behind the scenes --
well , as we know now -- what goes on in prisons .
based on the perception we have of the celebrities .
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life ,
and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage
I mean , it &apos;s extremely difficult to find these look-alikes ,
so I &apos;m constantly going up to people in the street
and be in one of my photographs or films .
mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person ,
I &apos;ve also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis --
Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture ;
Blair &apos;s views on Gordon Brown , which I find very interesting ;
This image I &apos;ve decided to show having a reservation about it .
I made it a year ago . And just how meanings change ,
and there were a terrible thing that has happened ,
but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that .
That &apos;s why this image was made one year ago ,
So , I &apos;ll leave you with these clips to have a look .
goes to cardiovascular disease care , whether it &apos;s private or public .
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored .
And that situation cannot be right . We must do something about it .
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .
17 million people die every year from heart disease .
Most of this is in developing countries , and the majority is in Africa .
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease
is in developing countries -- not in the West --
and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West .
It &apos;s not just the Africans that should be concerned about that .
All friends of Africa , that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time ,
if you go back to your room at night ,
and you start getting chest pains , shortness of breath , sweating ?
You &apos;re having a heart attack . What are you going to do ?
Will you fly back to the U.S. , Germany , Europe ?
No , you will die . 50 percent will die within 24 hours , if not treated .
In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here ,
By the time you get to 50 , it &apos;s almost no one left in Nigeria --
It &apos;s not because some people don &apos;t survive childhood illnesses --
they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach
Those are the times that they should be contributing
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents .
you cannot guarantee the security of the African child .
It &apos;s very well known . I &apos;m not going to spend a lot of time on those .
hypertension , diabetes , obesity , lack of exercise . The usual suspects .
Right here in Tanzania , 30 percent of individuals have hypertension .
we &apos;ll save 250,000 lives a year . That &apos;s quite significant !
Easy to treat . Look at the situation in Mauritius .
In eight short years -- we &apos;re here talking about HIV , malaria ,
We cannot make the mistakes we &apos;ve made with malaria and HIV .
will become the leading causes of death in Africa .
That is something to keep in mind . We can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this .
This is a typical African hospital . We can &apos;t depend on the elites --
they go to USA , Germany , U.K. for treatment . Unbelievable .
Post-9 / 11 , &#91; the &#93; United States has had a lot of trouble
So , they spend their money trying to fix those problems .
it is my responsibility . I have to take care of my own problems .
If they help , that &apos;s good ! But that is not my expectation .
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa
demand a new look . We cannot keep on doing things
If they have not worked , we have to look for alternative solutions .
This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us .
Everyone knows the problem . No one knows what the solutions are .
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is .
in terms of free money aid to developing countries .
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --
I live in Nashville , Tennessee , health care capital of America .
&#91; It &apos;s &#93; very easy to raise money for health-care ventures .
we &apos;re going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away .
That is totally wrong . Those of you in the audience here ,
if you want to help Africa , invest money in sustainable development .
Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute ,
so you get a glimpse of what we do ,
and I &apos;ll talk a little bit more about it .
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care ,
We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained ,
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt ,
and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost
that you will need to do those things in the United States .
that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay .
Whether you have one dollar , two dollars -- it doesn &apos;t matter .
And I will tell you how we &apos;re able to do it .
We make sure that we select our equipment properly .
We go for modular units . Units that have multi-modality functions
have modular components . Easy to repair , and because of that ,
we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last .
and we make sure that this process is regenerative .
Very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay ,
unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .
We made sure that we produced some things ourselves .
We manufacture them in-house , ourselves . That keeps the costs down .
that you &apos;ll get a unit dose for 250 dollars --
we come at a price of about two dollars .
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap
Technology is a great equalizer . How do we make it work ?
and we can use expertise in a very smart way .
This is the way our centers are set up .
And we have now decided to go into Africa .
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute
in Port Harcourt , Nigeria . That project will be starting
within the next few months . We hope to open in 2008-09 .
This model can be adapted to every disease process .
and all the images are populated to review stations .
And we designed this telemedicine solution . It &apos;s proprietary to us ,
and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone
who is interested in doing it . You can still be profitable .
We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access
I &apos;ll lead you through , to see how this happens .
This is at the Heart Institute . The doctors from anywhere can log in .
I can call you in Switzerland and say , &quot; Listen , go into our system .
Look at Mrs. Jones . Look at the study , tell me what you think . &quot;
and we &apos;ll make the care of the patient better .
He doesn &apos;t have to experience the anxiety of not knowing
I &apos;m happy to say that the things we have implemented --
80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them , and yet the technology is there .
Because if you can &apos;t get it in Nashville , you can travel to Birmingham ,
two hours away , and you &apos;ll get it . If you can &apos;t get it in Cleveland ,
you can go to Cincinnati . We don &apos;t have that luxury ,
When we do it , we will put the cost of care down .
And we &apos;ll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable .
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that .
But , you know , you have to tell people what can be done .
It &apos;s not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive ,
They need to be alive , they need to feed .
We recommend exercise as the most effective , simple , easy thing to do .
We have had walks every year -- every March , April .
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges .
Which group loses the most weight , we give them prizes .
That way we start exposing the children from very early on ,
on what these issues are . Because once they learn it ,
they will stay with it . In doing this we have created
and these are physicians with expertise and special training .
We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died ,
with complete heart block . For those that understand cardiology ,
If you don &apos;t get this pacemaker , you will be dead .
Indirectly , we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars
from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care .
By the end of this year , we would have contributed over one million dollars
in indigent care . In the first four months , it &apos;s been 340,000 dollars ,
averaging 85,000 dollars a month . The government will not do that ,
They need to put resources elsewhere . But we can still do it .
People say , &quot; How can you do that ? &quot; This is how we can do that .
At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment
have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami
And , if they went to Miami , they will spend significantly more --
eight to 10 times more . And they feel happy spending it at home ,
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay ,
it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people
For this to work , this progress must be sustainable .
We have gone further : we have formed a relationship
so that we will train people locally , who can repair that equipment .
That way we &apos;re not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues .
We &apos;re also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs --
those kinds of things . Now , with that kind of training ,
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging
and all that kind of stuff . In the process , I want you to just hear
from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them .
I &apos;m a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care
as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program .
about the utility of the training I received here ,
and I think there &apos;s been an increased interest now in --
particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting .
Sharon Lazarus : I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean ,
since the past two years . I received training at this institution .
that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica
is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases .
Ernest Madu : The lesson in this is that it can be done , and it can be sustained ,
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care ?
It is not my decision . My job is to make sure that every person ,
no matter what fate has assigned to you , will have the opportunity
to get the best quality health care in life .
that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt , Nigeria ,
as I said before . We will do other centers across West Africa .
We will extend the same system into other areas ,
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation ,
we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we &apos;ve done it ,
and how you can do it . If we do this ,
we can change the face of health care in Africa .
Africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to Africa .
I think I &apos;ll start out and just talk a little bit about
that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal --
all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is
getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent
you know , that Bill Gates talked about this morning .
And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking .
OK , this is a test where you either have to
pick out the big letters , or pick out the little letters ,
And the thing is , the normal brain ignores the details .
Well , if you &apos;re building a bridge , details are pretty important
because it will fall down if you ignore the details .
And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today
I &apos;m really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out
I noticed a lot of little things that most people don &apos;t notice
this flag waving , right in front of the veterinary facility .
This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility ;
all they needed to do was move the flag .
In the early &apos; 70s when I started , I got right down
in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing .
People thought that was crazy . A coat on a fence would make them balk ,
shadows would make them balk , a hose on the floor ...
and that &apos;s shown very , very nicely in the movie .
My drawings got to star in the movie too .
So , what is thinking in pictures ? It &apos;s literally movies
Now , when I was a young kid I didn &apos;t know my thinking was different .
And then when I did my book , &quot; Thinking In Pictures , &quot;
my thinking was quite different . Like if I say ,
most people get this sort of generalized generic one .
but it &apos;s going to be true in a lot of different places .
They flash up into my memory , just like Google for pictures .
And in the movie , they &apos;ve got a great scene in there
where the word &quot; shoe &quot; is said , and a whole bunch of &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s shoes
And they just kind of come up , kind of like this .
and then I think , &quot; OK , well maybe we can have it snow ,
and I can hold it there and turn them into videos .
I &apos;m not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides .
I &apos;ve got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it .
But , one of the things that I was able to do in my design work
of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie .
And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types
and autism types working out there on the movie set too .
But one of the things that really worries me
is : Where &apos;s the younger version of those kids going today ?
They &apos;re not ending up in Silicon Valley , where they belong .
Now , one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn &apos;t that social ,
is I had to sell my work , and not myself .
is I showed off my drawings , I showed off pictures of things .
Another thing that helped me as a little kid
is , boy , in the &apos; 50s , you were taught manners .
You were taught you can &apos;t pull the merchandise off the shelves
Now , when kids get to be in third or fourth grade ,
you might see that this kid &apos;s going to be a visual thinker ,
Now , I had this brain scan done several years ago ,
and I used to joke around about having a
and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control .
is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex .
Now , the thing is , the visual thinker &apos;s just one kind of mind .
You see , the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind --
And where I was bad was algebra . And I was never allowed
Gigantic mistake : I &apos;m finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra ,
Now , another kind of mind is the pattern thinker .
is made from a single sheet of paper --
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it .
And then there &apos;s a verbal mind , they know every fact about everything .
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face .
so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it ,
and they got it bent so it &apos;s not hitting my chin .
But sensory is an issue . Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights ;
Now , visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight
Because think about it : An animal is a sensory-based thinker ,
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant .
He knows who &apos;s been there , when they were there .
Are they friend or foe ? Is there anybody he can go mate with ?
There &apos;s a ton of information on that fire hydrant .
You could have a horse that &apos;s been abused by a rider .
and with the horseshoer , but you can &apos;t ride him .
You have another horse , where maybe the horseshoer beat him up
and he &apos;ll be terrible for anything on the ground ,
with the veterinarian , but a person can ride him .
a man on foot -- they &apos;re two different things .
See , I want you to think about just how specific this is .
I find a lot of people are not very good at this .
they don &apos;t seem to be able to figure out , &quot; Do I have a training people issue ?
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment ? &quot;
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
Now , let &apos;s say I figure out it &apos;s an equipment problem .
Is it a minor problem , with something simple I can fix ?
Or is the whole design of the system wrong ?
what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of ?
You know , five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years ,
the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke
And when the pilots walk around the plane , guess what ? They can &apos;t see
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle .
Now , here is a horse that was deathly afraid
He &apos;d been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat .
Now , the thing is , the world is going to need
We &apos;ve got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds .
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy ,
as I travel around and I do autism meetings ,
is I &apos;m seeing a lot of smart , geeky , nerdy kids ,
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher .
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie .
I was a goofball student . When I was in high school
This brings up the whole thing of you &apos;ve got to show kids
You know , one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do
is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED ,
and there &apos;s all kinds of great stuff on the Internet
Because I &apos;m seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids ,
and the teachers out in the Midwest , and the other parts of the country ,
they don &apos;t know what to do with these kids .
to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind ,
or your mind can be wired to be more social .
And what some of the research now has shown in autism
in the really brilliant mind , and we lose a few social circuits here .
It &apos;s kind of a trade-off between thinking and social .
And then you can get into the point where it &apos;s so severe
you &apos;re going to have a person that &apos;s going to be non-verbal .
language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals .
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain ,
and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars .
that there was some work done to show that
because I think that &apos;s going to go on in my autism lectures .
I mean art was my best subject in school .
We &apos;ve got to think about all these different kinds of minds ,
and we &apos;ve got to absolutely work with these kind of minds ,
because I was a goofball that didn &apos;t want to study .
But you know what ? I was getting work experience .
I &apos;m seeing too many of these smart kids who haven &apos;t learned basic things ,
I was taught that when I was eight years old .
You know , how to have table manners at granny &apos;s Sunday party .
I was taught that when I was very , very young .
And when I was 13 , I had a job at a dressmaker &apos;s shop
and I also had to learn how to do assignments .
You know , all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little .
My mother said , &quot; Well let &apos;s do a picture of something else . &quot;
They &apos;ve got to learn how to do something else .
Let &apos;s figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance .
in order to motivate that kid , that &apos;s one of the things we need to do .
I really get fed up when they , you know , the teachers ,
especially when you get away from this part of the country ,
they don &apos;t know what to do with these smart kids .
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up ?
They can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers ,
The pattern thinkers , they &apos;re the ones that are going to be
your computer programmers , all of those kinds of jobs .
And then you &apos;ve got the word minds . They make great journalists ,
and they also make really , really good stage actors .
I had to learn social skills like being in a play .
It &apos;s just kind of -- you just have to learn it .
And we need to be working with these students .
You know , my science teacher was not an accredited teacher .
Now , some states now are getting it to where
if you have a degree in biology , or a degree in chemistry ,
you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry .
the good teachers , for a lot of these kids ,
but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
Another thing that can be very , very , very successful is
there is a lot of people that may have retired
from working in the software industry , and they can teach your kid .
And it doesn &apos;t matter if what they teach them is old ,
because what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re lighting the spark .
And you get him turned on , then he &apos;ll learn all the new stuff .
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies ,
the thing about the autism , Asperger-y kind of mind ,
you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task . Don &apos;t just say , &quot; Design new software . &quot;
You &apos;ve got to tell them something a lot more specific :
And I just want to thank everybody for coming .
You know , you once wrote , I like this quote ,
then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire
Temple Grandin : Because who do you think made the first stone spears ?
The Asperger guy . And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics
CA : So , I want to ask you a couple other questions ,
TG : Well , first of all , you &apos;ve got to look at age .
If you have a two , three or four year old
Don &apos;t wait , you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching .
You know , the thing is , autism comes in different degrees .
There &apos;s going to be about half the people on the spectrum
that are not going to learn to talk , and they &apos;re not going to be working
Silicon Valley , that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;ve got to get them turned on
I rode horses with other kids , I made model rockets with other kids ,
onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show .
TG : Well let me tell you , that child will be loyal ,
and if your house is burning down , they &apos;re going to get you out of it .
CA : Wow . So , most people , if you ask them
what are they most passionate about , they &apos;d say things like ,
TG : I &apos;m passionate about that the things I do
are going to make the world a better place .
When I have a mother of an autistic child say ,
&quot; My kid went to college because of your book ,
or one of your lectures , &quot; that makes me happy .
You know , the slaughter plants , I &apos;ve worked with them
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants
where you just measure outcomes : How many cattle fell down ?
It &apos;s worked really well . I get satisfaction out of
in the real world . We need a lot more of that ,
CA : When we were talking on the phone , one of the things you said that
you were passionate about was server farms . Tell me about that .
TG : Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that ,
that is extremely valuable . So , maybe , over 10 years ago
And this is before the Internet got really big .
And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked ,
CA : Temple , can I just say it &apos;s an absolute delight to have you at TED .
we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets .
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research ,
or art as a form of R &amp; amp ; D for humanity ,
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists
to start them off further on in the process
Today , I &apos;d like to show you something which came out of these collaborations .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
I thought I &apos;d start with telling you or showing you the people who started &#91; Jet Propulsion Lab &#93; .
as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals
Well , I don &apos;t recommend that you try to do that now .
Naturally , they blew up a shack , and Caltech , well , then ,
hey , you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there .
So , that &apos;s what we call our first five employees
As a matter of fact , one of them , who was , kind of , part of a cult
which was not too far from here on Orange Grove ,
and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals
and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals .
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd .
but as I walked out , then it was too cold ,
and I said , I &apos;d better put my shirt back on .
But more importantly , the reason I wanted to show this picture :
and go do something different , you know , and doing that .
And that &apos;s kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson
that one of my colleagues , you know , put on my wall in my office ,
and it says , &quot; Do not go where the path may lead .
Go instead where there is no path , and leave a trail . &quot;
look what everybody is doing , what they are doing ;
Don &apos;t try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing ,
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets ,
but we also used to have a lot of parties , you know .
As you can see , one of our parties , you know , a few years ago .
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago ,
after Sputnik was launched . We launched the first American satellite ,
and that &apos;s the one you see on the left in there .
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house .
And that was done over a period of a couple of years ,
and now we are the leading organization , you know ,
But even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves ,
So you see , on the bottom , that rocket was supposed to go upward ;
we started an event at JPL for &quot; Miss Guided Missile . &quot;
So , we used to have a celebration every year and select --
there used to be competition and parades and so on .
It &apos;s not very appropriate to do it now . Some people tell me to do it ;
I think , well , that &apos;s not really proper , you know , these days .
So , we do something a little bit more serious .
And that &apos;s what you see in the last Rose Bowl , you know ,
That &apos;s more on the play side . And on the right side ,
that &apos;s the Rover just before we finished its testing
to take it to the Cape to launch it .
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now .
So that kind of tells you about , kind of , the fun things ,
you know , and the serious things that we try to do .
But I said I &apos;m going to show you a short clip
of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea
Being able to treat sound as an instrument , and be able to dig
for more abstract sounds and things to play live ,
The music &apos;s half of me , but the other half --
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab . I &apos;m building the next Mars Rover .
are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them .
You &apos;ve got to do what you want to do .
And anyone who tells you you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t listen to them .
Tell them where to put it , and then just do what you want to do .
Charles Elachi : Now , moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff ,
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them ?
Well , the way I think about it is fairly simple .
Somehow , 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang , and you &apos;ve heard
a little bit about , you know , the origin of the universe .
or lots of people &apos;s imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang
we have this beautiful world that we live in today .
You look outside : you have all that beauty that you see ,
and here we have intelligent people like you and I
All that started from that Big Bang . So , the question is :
How did that happen ? How did that evolve ? How did the universe form ?
How did the galaxies form ? How did the planets form ?
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved ?
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars ?
So we literally are all made out of stardust .
We started from those stars ; we are made of stardust .
So , next time you are really depressed , look in the mirror
and you can look and say , hi , I &apos;m looking at a star here .
So , what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively
write the book of how things have came about as they are today .
And one of the first , or the easiest , places we can go
You know , it &apos;ll take us only six months to get there .
Six to nine months at the right time of the year .
It &apos;s a planet somewhat similar to Earth . It &apos;s a little bit smaller ,
but the land mass on Mars is about the same
It has polar caps . It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours ,
so it has weather . So , it &apos;s very similar to some extent ,
and you can see some of the features on it ,
or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars .
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth , except a hell of a lot larger .
So it &apos;s about the size , you know , of the United States .
It has volcanoes on it . And that &apos;s Mount Olympus on Mars ,
which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet .
And if you look at the height of it
and you compare it to Mount Everest , you see , it &apos;ll give you
an idea of how large that Mount Olympus , you know , is ,
So , it basically dwarfs , you know , Mount Everest here on Earth .
So , that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events
Recently from one of our satellites , this shows that it &apos;s Earth-like --
we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening .
and activity is going on as we speak today .
And these Rovers , people wonder now , what are they doing today ,
so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing .
This is one very large crater . Geologists love craters ,
because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground
which is about a few football fields in size .
And if you look at the top left , you see a little teeny dark dot .
If I zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the Rover on the surface .
So , that was taken from orbit ; we had the camera zoom on the surface ,
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface .
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images
and then you can get those Rovers to move around
And the reason is , many of you went to the Grand Canyon ,
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon , you see these layers .
And what these layers -- that &apos;s what the surface used to be
100 million years ago , and you get deposits on top of them .
So if you can read the layers it &apos;s like reading your book ,
and you can learn the history of what happened in the past
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall
of that crater , and the Rover is going down now , measuring , you know ,
Now , it &apos;s kind of a little bit of a challenge driving
If you were there you wouldn &apos;t do it yourself .
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers
before we got them down -- or that Rover --
Now , when I came last time , shortly after the landing --
I think it was , like , a hundred days after the landing --
I told you I was surprised that those Rovers
Well , here we are four years later , and they &apos;re still working .
Now you say , Charles , you are really lying to us , and so on ,
but that &apos;s not true . We really believed they were going to last
90 days or 100 days , because they are solar powered ,
and Mars is a dusty planet , so we expected the dust
would start accumulating on the surface , and after a while
we wouldn &apos;t have enough power , you know , to keep them warm .
Well , I always say it &apos;s important that you are smart ,
but every once in a while it &apos;s good to be lucky .
And that &apos;s what we found out . It turned out that every once in a while
there are dust devils which come by on Mars , as you are seeing here ,
and when the dust devil comes over the Rover , it just cleans it up .
It is like a brand new car that you have ,
and that &apos;s literally why they have lasted so long .
but that &apos;s exactly why they are lasting that long
Now , the two Rovers , each one of them is , kind of , getting old .
You know , one of them , one of the wheels is stuck , is not working ,
one of the front wheels , so what we are doing ,
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint , you know ,
it &apos;s not working very well , so it &apos;s walking like this ,
and we can move the arm , you know , that way .
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data .
Now , during that whole period , a number of people got excited ,
you know , outside the science community about these Rovers ,
so I thought I &apos;d show you a video just to give you a reflection
about how these Rovers are being viewed by people
So let me go on the next short video .
By the way , this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place , you know ,
CE : That &apos;s about what happened in the Houston operation room . It &apos;s exactly like this .
Video : Now , if there is life , the Dutch will find it .
So anyway , let me continue on showing you a little bit
As I said earlier , it looked very much like Earth ,
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken
from the Sahara Desert or somewhere , and you &apos;d have believed me ,
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us
is the northern region , you know , of Mars , close to the North Pole ,
because we see ice caps , and we see the ice caps shrinking
and expanding , so it &apos;s very much like you have in northern Canada .
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it .
what is that ice made of , and could that have embedded in it
So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars ,
17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds from now ,
So it &apos;s on May 25 around just before five o &apos;clock our time here
on the West Coast , actually we will be landing on another planet .
And as you can see , this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars ,
but I thought that just in case you &apos;re going to miss that show , you know ,
Video : That &apos;s what we call the seven minutes of terror .
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples
that we put them in an oven and actually heat them
We &apos;ll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour , and in seven minutes
we have to stop and touch the surface very softly
Ben Cichy : Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission .
It &apos;s the first mission that &apos;s going to try to land
near the North Pole of Mars , and it &apos;s the first mission
that &apos;s actually going to try and reach out and touch water
Lynn Craig : Where there tends to be water , at least on Earth ,
there tends to be life , and so it &apos;s potentially a place
where life could have existed on the planet in the past .
Erik Bailey : The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling
at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt
in a soft way in a very short amount of time .
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aero-shuttle .
EB : Looks kind of like an ice cream cone , more or less .
BC : And on the front of it is this heat shield ,
of essentially what &apos;s cork on the front of it ,
and this cork is what &apos;s going to protect us
from the violent atmospheric entry that we &apos;re about to experience .
Rob Grover : Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft ,
and we use the friction when it &apos;s flying through the atmosphere
BC : From this point , we &apos;re going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour
EB : The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun .
RG : The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit .
EB : If you fire the &apos; chute too early , the parachute itself could fail .
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart .
BC : In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute ,
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us
from the force of atmospheric entry , so we jettison the heat shield ,
exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars .
LC : After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed ,
the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect
BC : We &apos;ve lost 99 percent of our entry velocity .
So , we &apos;re 99 percent of the way to where we want to be .
But that last one percent , as it always seems to be , is the tricky part .
when it &apos;s going to get rid of its parachute .
BC : We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour
at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars : 3,200 feet .
EB : That &apos;s when we separate from the back shell ,
It &apos;s a very scary moment ; a lot has to happen
but it &apos;s also trying to use all of its actuators
to make sure that it &apos;s in the right position to land .
EB : And then it has to light up its engines , right itself ,
and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely .
BC : Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes
for a signal from Mars to get to Earth .
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes .
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started
EB : We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft
It &apos;s about getting a spacecraft that &apos;s hurtling through deep space
and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out
how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour .
CE : Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here .
So it will be a very tense moment , you know ,
as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet .
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing .
So we are in the process , as we speak , of actually designing
the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars .
So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you , kind of ,
It &apos;s very similar to what you do when you design your product .
we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing .
So we have to study all kinds of different materials ,
In general we don &apos;t try to please the customer here .
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective , you know ,
First we start by we want to have our employees
And we really love being close to the art center , because we have ,
as a matter of fact , one of the alumni from the art center ,
in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room ,
just to get people to think wildly about things .
We have a bunch of Legos . So , as I said ,
this is a playground for adults , where they sit down and try to play
Then we get a little bit more serious , so we have
what we call our CAD / CAMs and all the engineers who are involved ,
or scientists who are involved , who know about thermal properties ,
all of these things , which they work in a team effort
and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent ,
so to see , does that meet the requirement that we need .
On the right , also , we have to take into account
the environment of the planet where we are going .
If you are going to Jupiter , you have a very high-radiation ,
you know , environment . It &apos;s about the same radiation environment
So just imagine : you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor
So these are kind of some of the little challenges , you know ,
If we are doing entry , we have to do tests of parachutes .
You saw in the video a parachute breaking . That would be a bad day ,
you know , if that happened , so we have to test ,
because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds .
We are coming at extremely high speeds , and we are deploying them
to slow us down . So we have to do all kinds of tests .
To give you an idea of the size , you know , of that parachute
Next step , we go and actually build some kind of test models
and actually test them , you know , in the lab at JPL ,
We kick them , we hit them , we drop them ,
just to make sure we understand how , where would they break .
And then we back off , you know , from that point .
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight .
And this next Rover that we &apos;re flying is about the size of a car .
that &apos;s a heat shield which is going to protect it .
And that will be basically built over the next year ,
and it will be launched June a year from now .
Now , in that case , because it was a very big Rover ,
And I know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said
well , that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags .
Unfortunately this Rover is , like , ten times the size of the , you know ,
mass-wise , of the other Rover , or three times the mass .
So we can &apos;t use airbags . So we have to come up with
another ingenious idea of how do we land it .
And we didn &apos;t want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface
we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs .
Actually , the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover
above that surface for 100 feet , and then we have a sky crane
which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface .
Hopefully it all will work , you know , it will work that way .
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist .
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around ,
it &apos;s going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks .
So it will have an arm which will take samples ,
put them in an oven , crush and analyze them .
But also , if there is something that we cannot reach
because it is too high on a cliff , we have a little laser system
which will actually zap the rock , evaporate some of it ,
So it &apos;s a little bit like &quot; Star Wars , &quot; you know , but it &apos;s real .
And also to help you , to help the community
so you can do ads on that Rover , we are going to train that Rover
to actually in addition to do this , to actually serve cocktails ,
So that &apos;s kind of giving you an idea of the kind of , you know ,
I thought I &apos;d go to &quot; The Lord of the Rings &quot; now
and show you some of the things we have there .
Now , &quot; The Lord of the Rings &quot; has two things played through it .
it just has the beauty of the rings and so on .
But for scientists , also the rings have a special meaning ,
because we believe they represent , on a small scale ,
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed ,
that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun ,
a lot of the dust around it created rings
and then the particles in those rings accumulated together ,
and they formed bigger rocks , and then that &apos;s how the planets ,
So , the idea is , by watching Saturn we &apos;re actually watching
our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale ,
First , I &apos;m going to fly you over the rings .
By the way , all of this is real stuff .
that we have in orbit around Saturn , the Cassini .
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings ,
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles .
So that &apos;s why you have these gaps , is because a small satellite , you know ,
Now , you think that those rings are very large objects .
in the other dimension they are paper thin . Very , very thin .
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself .
huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles , which is rotating .
And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form ,
each one looking very different and very odd , and that keeps
scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this ,
and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain
what these things look like , or why they formed that way .
Well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .
It &apos;s a satellite which was all made of ice ,
and we measured it from orbit . Made of ice .
If you look at these stripes in here , what we call tiger stripes ,
when we flew over them , all of a sudden we saw
an increase in the temperature , which said that those stripes
So as we flew by away from it , we looked back . And guess what ?
So this is a Yellowstone , you know , of Saturn .
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet ,
which indicate that most likely there is an ocean , you know ,
And somehow , through some dynamic effect , we &apos;re having these geysers
And the reason I showed the little arrow there ,
we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft
so we can actually measure the material that it is made of .
That was &#91; unclear &#93; also -- you know , because we were worried
about the risk of it , but it worked pretty well .
We flew at the top of it , and we found that there is a fair amount of
organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice .
And over the next few years , as we keep orbiting , you know , Saturn ,
we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface
Now , another satellite also attracted a lot of attention ,
and that &apos;s Titan . And the reason Titan is particularly interesting ,
it &apos;s a satellite bigger than our moon , and it has an atmosphere .
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere .
So if you were on Titan , you would feel the same pressure
that you feel in here . Except it &apos;s a lot colder ,
Now , methane gets people all excited , because it &apos;s organic material ,
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call
a pre-biotic planet , because it &apos;s so cold organic material did not get
So it could be Earth , frozen three billion years ago
So that &apos;s getting a lot of interest , and to show you some example
of what we did in there , we actually dropped a probe ,
which was developed by our colleagues in Europe , we dropped a probe
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan .
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down .
Just looked like the coast of California for me .
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast ,
and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island ,
And then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument ,
we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here ,
It looks like there are rivers on it , there are oceans or lakes ,
we know there are clouds . We think it &apos;s raining also on it .
So it &apos;s very much like the cycle on Earth except
because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know ,
What it turned out , that all that we are seeing , all this liquid ,
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth ,
but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material .
So if you were on Mars -- sorry , on Titan ,
You just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hose in it ,
On the other hand , if you light a match
So in closing , I said I want to close by a couple of pictures .
And just to kind of put us in perspective ,
this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft
The Sun is behind Saturn , so we see what we call &quot; forward scattering , &quot;
so it highlights all the rings . And I &apos;m going to zoom .
There is a -- I &apos;m not sure you can see it very well ,
there is a little teeny dot , and that &apos;s Earth .
You barely can see ourselves . So what I did , I thought I &apos;d zoom on it .
So as you zoom in , you know , you can see Earth , you know ,
just in the middle here . So we zoomed all the way on the art center .
when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach ,
We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey ,
one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies .
And because we shared our genetic information with Linda ,
shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA --
We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman .
And being the current day , of course , we started our own Facebook group .
And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference ,
she &apos;d gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T-shirts .
and what does this have to do with the future of health ?
Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example
is affecting our future of health and wellness --
to the connection of the Internet and social networking .
But if you think about it , if you have a lily pad
What do you think you have in a month ? We &apos;re at a billion .
we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator --
to impact the future of our own health and of health care ,
and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today ,
the way we really don &apos;t use information very well today ,
And one of the major things we can do we &apos;ve talked a bit about here today
We spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life .
in the health care system and our own self
to move the curve to the left and improve our health ,
So if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving .
Imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do .
for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University
about 100 very talented students from around the world .
And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine , biotech ,
And coming up next month is actually Future Med ,
a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .
These mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available --
to the point where there &apos;s one out of the U.K.
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;d try that yet , but that &apos;s available .
so they can better understand and you can better understand
So let &apos;s see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
Well it &apos;s no secret that computers , through Moore &apos;s law ,
We have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
But where I think computational speed is most applicable
The ability now to look inside the body in real time
And we &apos;re layering multiple technologies -- PET scans , CT scans
to find and to seek things at different levels .
Here you &apos;re going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today ,
And now we can see inside of the brain
with a resolution and ability that was never before available ,
so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy .
We can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time .
And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections ,
we &apos;re going to understand the effects of medication or meditation
The scanners for these are getting small , less expensive and more portable .
And this sort of data explosion available from these
The scan of today takes up about 800 books , or 20 gigabytes .
The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte , or 800,000 books .
Let &apos;s get personal . I won &apos;t ask who here &apos;s had a colonoscopy ,
but if you &apos;re over age 50 , it &apos;s time for your screening colonoscopy .
How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick ?
Compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist ,
Oh , we might have missed it , but using A.I. on top of radiology ,
And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies
And this is an example of this paradigm shift .
We &apos;re moving to this integration of biomedicine , information technology ,
wireless and , I would say , mobile now -- this era of digital medicine .
We &apos;re moving , obviously , to the era of the tricorder .
of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred-thousand dollars --
for about 5,000 dollars , I can have the power
of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand .
And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records --
in the United States , we &apos;re still less than 20 percent electronic .
Here in the Netherlands , I think it &apos;s more than 80 percent .
But now that we &apos;re switching to merging medical data ,
and now as a physician , I can access my patients &apos; data from wherever I am
And now , of course , we &apos;re in the era of the iPad , even the iPad 2 .
to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .
And as you saw just about a month ago ,
Watson from IBM beat the two champions in Jeopardy .
So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years ,
when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity
Already today , you don &apos;t need to go to your physician in many cases .
Only for about 20 percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient .
We &apos;re now in the era of virtual visits --
from sort of the Skype-type visits you can do with American Well ,
to Cisco that &apos;s developed a very complex health presence system .
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different .
And these are being augmented even by our devices again today .
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration
so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way .
Or might we be able to leverage today &apos;s gaming technology ,
We can actually now visit our patients robotically --
These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now .
You can Tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together .
So instead of wearing these kludgy devices , we can put on a simple patch .
This was developed by colleagues at Stanford , called the iRhythm --
completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point
Now we &apos;re also in the era , today , of quantified self .
I can get insight into that on a daily basis .
I can share that with my friends , with my physician .
There &apos;s watches coming out that will measure your heart rate , the Zeo sleep monitors ,
a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage
we &apos;re going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight
There &apos;s even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
And I would argue , in the future , we &apos;ll have wearable devices in our clothes ,
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars ,
your red light might go on -- it won &apos;t say &quot; check engine &quot; though .
and go in and get it taken care of .
Probably in a few years , you &apos;ll check into your mirror
how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ...
too much information , I think , than you might need .
Now we &apos;ve heard a lot today about new technology and connection .
will enable us to be more connected with our patients ,
and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine ,
Now we &apos;ve talked about augmenting the patient , to some degree .
We &apos;re now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon
and do things with robotic surgery , which is here today ,
Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology
So the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens ,
where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .
A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam , for example .
where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach
And this is called NOTES , and this is coming --
For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic --
where chips have been put on the motor cortex
and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or , eventually , a robotic arm .
and going into more and more of these patients .
Still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these ,
such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues ,
and can allow the person who &apos;s lost a limb
to have much higher levels of dexterity or control
So we &apos;re really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
If you haven &apos;t lost a limb -- you &apos;ve had a stroke , for example --
Or if you &apos;re a paraplegic -- like I &apos;ve visited the folks at Berkley Bionics --
I took this video last week . Here &apos;s a paraplegic patient actually walking
And now this is the early era of wearable robotics .
And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies ,
This is Aimee Mullins , who lost her lower limbs as a young child ,
And now both of these can climb better , move faster , swim differently
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction ,
But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
So a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era
help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract .
that will eventually autonomously move through your system again
and be able to do things that surgeons can &apos;t do
so you don &apos;t need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them .
And they &apos;re going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices
so you can go places and be monitored remotely .
Here &apos;s one that &apos;s in prototyping by Medtronic that &apos;s smaller than a penny .
Artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball
Again , in early trials , but moving into the future .
BlueTooth , WiFi available -- beams back images to your eye .
to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you .
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again
and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics ?
like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford .
Put it on a chip , enable thousands of tests to be done
at the point of care , anywhere in the world .
and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies
If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther ,
to the point where we can design red blood cells
or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system ,
or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine ,
but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper .
about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
probably next year to two years , probably a hundred-dollar genome .
What are we going to do with hundred-dollar genomes ?
And soon we &apos;ll have millions of these tests available .
And that &apos;s when it gets interesting , when we start to crowdsource that information .
And we enter the era of true personalized medicine --
the right drug for the right person at the right time --
instead of what we &apos;re doing today , which is the same drug for everybody --
And many , many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches .
And I &apos;ll also show you a simple example , from 23andMe again .
My data indicates that I &apos;ve got about average risk
But if I take that same data , upload it to deCODEme ,
I can look at my risk for sample Type II diabetes .
I &apos;m at almost twice the risk for Type II diabetes .
I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example .
how my genes modulate , what my drugs do and what doses I need
and once in the hands of the individual and the patient ,
So again , it &apos;s not just genes , it &apos;s multiple details --
When was the last time your physician asked you where you &apos;ve lived ?
Geomedicine : where you &apos;ve lived , what you &apos;ve been exposed to ,
all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians ,
Well we &apos;re now entering the era of systems medicine , or systems biology ,
where we can start to integrate all of this information .
And by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood
we can start to look at these little patterns
This has been called by Lee Hood , the father of the field ,
We &apos;re going to be predictive ; we &apos;re going to know what you &apos;re likely to have .
We can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ;
and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly participatory .
or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health ,
We &apos;d like to get therapies better and more effective .
Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills .
and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure
This is a new device that is essentially doing that .
It should be on the market within a year or two .
and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison .
the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse .
So if you think of cancer as a weed ,
It seems to shrink , but it often comes back .
and the tumor can return months or years later .
We &apos;re now learning to identify the cancer stem cells
and identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure .
the ability to leverage all of this data together ,
So I &apos;ve studied a lot about stem cells --
We also have adult stem cells throughout our body .
We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation .
to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival
using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .
a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow .
and it &apos;ll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so .
curving through the patient &apos;s body and removing the patient &apos;s bone marrow ,
instead of with 200 punctures , with just a single puncture under local anesthesia .
If you think about it , every cell in your body has the same DNA
to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell
and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient --
And I think they &apos;ll be a new era of your own stem cell banking
to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells ,
to use them in the future , should you need them .
And we &apos;re integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering ,
That &apos;s where things are going to head -- still very early days .
So in close , as you think about technology trends
if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these ,
and begin to cure the well before they get sick .
Because I know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with Stage I disease ,
But often it &apos;s too late and it &apos;s Stage III or IV cancer , for example .
And as a cancer doctor , I &apos;m looking forward to being out of a job .
and your brain can be broken into two parts .
There &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side ,
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere ,
And for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
So where would you put your brain on this scale ?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes ,
but I think for most people in the audience ,
with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time .
And so I consider myself one of these people ,
along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists ,
But at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition
How do we develop this intuition ? Well we like to play with stuff .
So we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts ,
is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
I mean , it can sound weird to think about
one thing being in two different places at the same time ,
but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
He was just a toddler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson ,
and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them ,
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world ,
It &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist ,
they find they do all sorts of really weird things --
or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
And so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ;
and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often .
But it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
Because if everything is made up of little particles
And so I &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing
So a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
And that &apos;s this piece of metal I &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
And here I &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . We &apos;re looking right there in the center .
And then here &apos;s a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal .
So what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal ,
and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sticking out over a ledge .
in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer ,
and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
For the last stuff , I had to build my own machine --
but it needs a little help to do it .
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I &apos;m in an elevator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things ,
and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
And so we knew , if we wanted to see
we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers .
and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air ,
to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
We found it was moving in really weird ways .
Instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating ,
and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --
So what I &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal
Now it &apos;s only at precise times when they align .
is in two different places at the same time ,
which in turn means the entire chunk of metal
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years
between a single atom and that chunk of metal
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time ,
that chunk of metal can be in two different places ,
I mean , this is just my logical side talking .
So imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time ,
and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box ,
we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
And so I had to develop this new intuition ,
that it seems like all the objects in the elevator
about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually .
Spencer , and his grandmother , who was shocked by his work .
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ;
her flat , two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen
even then . All along it was the sadness , the squalor ,
when often the first sound you &apos;d hear in the morning
of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block ,
and the last sound at night as likely as not
would be your father pulling up in his car ,
and going heavily down to the cellar , to the furnace ,
to shake out the ashes and damp the draft
before he came upstairs to fall into bed --
light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown
and , when you had to go look for a child ,
or run down to the grocery store on the corner ,
not only were never made up during the day ,
adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access ,
In those days , one hid much else as well :
or , at a ball game , thumped your friend &apos;s back
and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection ;
the shock of your father &apos;s whiskers on your cheek ,
and you could hug another man , then hold on for a moment ,
though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --
into the bushes : like a creature of leaves you &apos;d lurk ,
It actually happened right at the time we met .
who incessantly yap on the roof under my window .
Her shadow once , fumbling the chain on her door ,
only the barking and the music -- jazz --
filtering as it does , day and night into the hall .
The time it was Chris Connor singing &quot; Lush Life &quot; --
my first real love , who -- till I left her --
And head on my shoulder , hand on my thigh ,
as I was too young , later , to believe in her pain .
My starting to fancy she &apos;d ended up in this fire-trap
My seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the mailbox .
A man shouting , &quot; Shut up ! &quot; The dogs frantically snarling ,
when she came to find me at a party ,
Another , different kind of poem of youth and age .
when the blue-haired lady in the doctor &apos;s waiting room
so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop
is a nice coincidence . Because not an hour ago ,
who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that ,
I &apos;d forgotten that not the least part of my awe
consisted of the fact that with every jump he took
I didn &apos;t know if I wanted to break him , or be him .
are urban poems . I happen to be reading a bunch that aren &apos;t .
Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter ,
I was frightened of her . I felt like a child .
would go out of control , and I &apos;d be forever entrapped
Sometimes I &apos;d think I should take her home with me ,
She wouldn &apos;t have wanted me to , I would think .
This is a newer poem , a brand new poem .
as brilliant as she is , first in her class ,
which wouldn &apos;t even be open if it were winter --
if it were winter someone would have closed it --
than this , really an instant , and lets herself fall .
never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ...
or if there is , it &apos;s not her , or not wholly her ,
but a self I took of my own volition unto myself .
I &apos;ll read just one more . I don &apos;t usually say that .
But I &apos;m afraid that Ricky will come out here
if I &apos;m not in a state of incipient desire .
guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah
Because there were images in it he said were licentious .
The display was a photo . Men and women stripped naked ,
waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch .
That she died in the camps made her --
But it was like sex , you didn &apos;t have to be told .
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me ,
I live my life over , as though I were drowning .
What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --
with her sham heat , and her bosom probably plumped
but we &apos;re also aware that , since the beginning of photography ,
if you didn &apos;t recognize many or most of them .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement
And at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
These gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified ,
we &apos;ve been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself
when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;
that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq
the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces .
with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm ,
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest .
and in particular -- I &apos;ve given a lot of talks on this
In the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease
A simple act , in 1987 , of the most famous woman in the world ,
did a great deal , especially in Europe , to stop that .
She , better than most , knew the power of an image .
So when we are confronted by a powerful image ,
We can look away , or we can address the image .
they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money
Images often push us to question our core beliefs
that they were far from the minds of Americans
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .
and it &apos;s a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran
which has never been published , called War Is Personal .
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
that haunts me still , much more than the others .
Ansel Adams said , and I &apos;m going to disagree with him ,
In my view , it &apos;s not the photographer who makes the photo ,
and as a result of that , the image resonates with us .
I was the only human being in an area
-- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it &apos;s -- it &apos;s --
It &apos;s a journey that is right at the limit
And I was dragging all the food I needed ,
one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months .
What we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes I &apos;ve got left ,
is to try and answer three questions . The first one is , why ?
how do you go to the loo at minus 40 ?
exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute , so how do you answer the call of nature ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to answer these now . I &apos;ll come on to them at the end .
Third one : how do you top that ? What &apos;s next ?
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap .
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here ,
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole ,
geographic North Pole , is that it &apos;s slap bang in the middle of the sea .
and to reach it you &apos;ve got to ski literally
the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean .
I &apos;d read lots of books . I studied maps and charts .
But I realized on the morning of day one
I was 23 years old . No one my age
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two .
We started running very low on food . We were both pretty hungry , losing lots of weight .
Some very unusual weather conditions , very difficult ice conditions .
We couldn &apos;t afford a satellite phone , so we had HF radio .
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent .
two-way communication with the outside world in two months .
We &apos;d skied 400 miles . We were just over 200 miles left
to go to the Pole , and we &apos;d run out of time .
We were too late into the summer ; the ice was starting to melt ;
we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio ,
and they said , &quot; Look boys , you &apos;ve run out of time .
for as long as I could remember -- I hadn &apos;t even come close .
And skiing along that first trip , I had two
imaginary video clips that I &apos;d replay over and over again in my mind
when the going got tough , just to keep my motivation going .
being filmed out of the door of a helicopter , there was , kind of , rock music playing in the background ,
and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack , you know , flying in the wind .
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole , you know --
ah , glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo .
that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport ,
the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal .
We didn &apos;t get to the Pole , and we didn &apos;t have any money
to pay anyone to do the PR , so no one had heard
And I got back to Heathrow . My mum was there ; my brother was there ;
my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --
-- and that was about it . I went back to live with my mum .
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition ,
My brother sent me a text message , an SMS --
it was a quote from the &quot; Simpsons . &quot; It said ,
Fast forward three years . I did eventually get off the sofa ,
I wanted to go right across , on my own this time ,
to the North Pole , where the sort of kink in the middle is ,
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own .
Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000 . No one &apos;s done it solo .
So for some reason , this was what I wanted to have a crack at ,
but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece ,
to working with one of the world &apos;s leading nutritionists
At first it was pretty sensible . We flew British Airways to Moscow .
The next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane
to fly us up to a town called Khatanga ,
which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
Our cameraman , who it turned out was a pretty nervous flyer at the best of times ,
actually asked the pilot , before we got on the plane , how long this flight would take ,
and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan , replied ,
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn &apos;t the end of the world ,
It was supposed to be an overnight stay . We were stuck there for 10 days .
There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between
the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter ,
Finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-clear ,
loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem --
dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming ,
and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter ,
And I don &apos;t know if words will ever quite do that moment justice .
All I could think about was running back up to the door ,
To make things worse , you can just see the white dot
up at the top right hand side of the screen ; that &apos;s a full moon .
Because we &apos;d been held up in Russia , of course ,
the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides ;
when you &apos;re standing on the frozen surface of the sea ,
that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit .
I was , you can see there , pulling two sledges .
Grand total in all , 95 days of food and fuel ,
When the ice wasn &apos;t flat , I didn &apos;t have a hope in hell .
I had to pull one , leave it , and go back and get the other one .
the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean ,
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began .
And it &apos;s always drifting . The pack ice is always drifting .
out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year ,
and I was drifting backwards most of the time .
I got up in the morning , took the tent down , skied north for seven-and-a-half hours ,
put the tent up , and I was two and a half miles further back
I literally couldn &apos;t keep up with the drift of the ice .
I &apos;m lying in the tent , getting ready to go .
Later in the expedition , the problem was no longer the ice .
It was a lack of ice -- open water .
I knew this was happening . I knew the Artic was warming .
I knew there was more open water . And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve .
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines .
If they come to water , they &apos;ll climb in , swim across it .
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway --
that I could climb into . It would go on over my boots , over my mittens ,
it would pull up around my face , and seal pretty tightly around my face .
and if I fell through , it wasn &apos;t the end of the world .
It also meant , if the worst came to the worst ,
there was -- one of his crew , a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees .
Well , Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years . This is my pocket wireless telephone ,
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket .
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice ,
sending back information on the distance I &apos;d covered --
we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world .
that &apos;s been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest .
When you get lots of mist , low cloud , the wind starts blowing the snow up .
You can &apos;t see an awful lot . You can just see , there &apos;s a yellow
So , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May .
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia ,
There isn &apos;t even a pole at the Pole . There &apos;s nothing there ,
Stick a flag there , leave it there , pretty soon it will drift off , usually towards Canada or Greenland .
Strange mixture of feelings : it was extremely warm by this stage ,
of course , elated that I &apos;d got there under my own steam ,
that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada ,
The only proof I &apos;ve got that I was there
is a blurry photo of my GPS , the little satellite navigation gadget .
there &apos;s a nine and a string of zeros here .
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole .
I took a photo of that . Sat down on my sledge . Did a sort of video diary piece .
Took a few photos . I got my satellite phone out .
I dialed my girlfriend . I dialed the CEO of my sponsor .
I finally got through to my mum . She was at the queue of the supermarket .
She started crying . She asked me to call her back .
I skied on for a week past the Pole .
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could
This was the last day I had on the ice .
When I spoke to the -- my project management team ,
they said , &quot; Look , Ben , conditions are getting too dangerous .
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position .
I &apos;d never tried to build an airstrip before . Tony , the expedition manager , he said ,
&quot; Look Ben , you &apos;ve got to find 500 meters of
The only bit of ice I could find --
it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip --
was exactly 473 meters . I could measure it with my skis .
I didn &apos;t tell Tony that . I didn &apos;t tell the pilots that .
It just about worked . A pretty dramatic landing --
and I was a bit worried it wasn &apos;t going to land at all .
The pilot , I knew , was called Troy . I was expecting someone called Troy
that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment .
So I thought , I &apos;ve got to compose myself for Troy .
I &apos;m supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type .
The plane taxied up to where I was standing .
The door opened . This guy jumped out . He &apos;s about that tall . He said , &quot; Hi , my name is Troy . &quot;
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper .
They were the least macho people I &apos;ve ever met , but they made my day .
climbed up the ladder . He said , &quot; Just -- just get in the back . &quot;
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front ,
Taxied up and down the runway a few times ,
just to flatten it out a bit , and he said , &quot; Right , I &apos;m going to --
I &apos;m going to give it a go . &quot; And he --
I &apos;ve now learned that this is standard practice , but it had me worried at the time .
You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit .
It &apos;s that little bar there . He put his hand on the throttle .
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his .
I thought , &quot; God , here we go . We &apos;re , we &apos;re -- this is all or nothing . &quot;
Rammed it forwards . Bounced down the runway . Just took off .
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway ,
banking . I could see into the cockpit , Troy battling the controls ,
and he just took one hand off , reached back ,
flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit ,
and it was the &quot; fasten seat belt &quot; sign you can see on the wall .
And only from the air did I see the big picture .
Of course , when you &apos;re on the ice , you only ever see one obstacle at a time ,
whether it &apos;s a pressure ridge or there &apos;s a bit of water .
This is probably why I didn &apos;t get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
I mean , it really was starting to break up .
Why ? I &apos;m not an explorer in the traditional sense .
At the South Pole there &apos;s a big scientific base . There &apos;s an airstrip .
and of technology . They &apos;re the things that excite me .
And it &apos;s also about potential , on a personal level .
This , for me , is a chance to explore the limits --
really push the limits of my own potential , see how far they stretch .
And on a wider scale , it amazes me how people go through life
on a wider scale , I hope that this journey
with their potential , and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time
That &apos;s as close as I can come to summing that up .
The next question is , how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 ?
The answer , of course , to which is a trade secret --
if I have a minute left at the end , I &apos;ll go into more detail .
to the South Pole : the heart of the Antarctic continent .
If you include the coastal ice shelves , you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf --
it &apos;s the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France .
is twice the size of Australia -- it &apos;s a big place .
And there &apos;s a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen ,
the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies --
and a few dogs , all of which went wrong ,
and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot .
There was a tent , a letter to the Norwegian king .
And they turned around , headed back to the coast ,
and all five of them died on the return journey .
this was 93 years ago -- since then , no one has ever skied
from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back .
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about
is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles
or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing --
no one has ever made a return journey . So that &apos;s the plan .
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit , is --
is , I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I &apos;ve forgotten --
but I have a -- I have a school report . I was 13 years old ,
and it &apos;s framed above my desk at home . It says ,
I think if I &apos;ve learned anything , it &apos;s this : that no one else
You &apos;re the only person that decides how far you go and what you &apos;re capable of .
So , I was in the hospital for a long time .
And a few years after I left , I went back ,
and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me --
said , &quot; Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . &quot;
I was very excited . I walked with him to his office .
And he explained to me that , when I shave ,
I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is ,
I was badly burned so I have no hair ,
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
Let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave ,
and I realized that the way I was shaving then
would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life --
because I had to keep the width the same .
I said , &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot;
I said , &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?
so I said , &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life .
This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
there were many treatments I decided not to do --
and I never got this guilt trip to this extent .
And I went to his deputy and asked him , &quot; What was going on ?
And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already ,
and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing .
Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
A few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab .
we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high ,
another group that I thought their performance would be very low ,
and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got --
I was very happy -- aside from one person .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot;
and we said , &quot; What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all ,
we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; Fantastic ! What a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot;
because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower ,
giving us even stronger statistical results than we could .
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .
and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on conflicts of interest ,
The first one is that in life we encounter many people
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality
And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recognize ,
The most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize
And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
Because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .
And I think the real challenge is to figure out
and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it ,
that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors ,
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
I mean , this is all very depressing , right --
people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on .
The positive perspective , I think , of all of this
is that , if we do understand when we go wrong ,
And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much .
I &apos;m curious , show of hands , who agrees with it ?
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist
who &apos;s been in field of HIV for 15 years ,
People do get HIV because they do stupid things ,
and if you put your public health nerd glasses on ,
you &apos;ll see that if we give people the information that they need
about what &apos;s good for them and what &apos;s bad for them ,
that they can use to act on that information ,
That &apos;s slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV ,
So , let &apos;s start with what &apos;s rational for an addict .
Now , I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine , Frankie .
We were having lunch and he was telling me
about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection .
It was someone &apos;s birthday , and they had very kindly
and then he &apos;s wiping the needle on his shirt ,
and I can see the needle coming down towards me ,
And a small part of my brain is thinking ,
And , you know , you can &apos;t fault him for accuracy .
was a heroin addict and he was in jail .
to accept that dirty needle or not to get high .
And if there &apos;s one place you really want to get high ,
and I don &apos;t like to make data out of anecdotes ,
and we said , &quot; Well , do you know how you get HIV ? &quot;
I mean , nearly 100 percent . Yeah , by sharing needles .
And , &quot; Do you know where you can get a clean needle
at a price you can afford to avoid that ? &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re smackheads ; we know where to get clean needles . &quot;
in the places where they &apos;re hanging out and taking drugs .
So what &apos;s that about ? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something ?
We asked that to a junkie and they &apos;re like , &quot; Are you nuts ? &quot;
You don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want
to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
&quot; No , no . We share needles because we don &apos;t want to go to jail . &quot;
if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up ,
it &apos;s a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV ,
Now , let &apos;s look at it from a policy maker &apos;s point of view .
and do something about it on a national scale
and other countries followed suit : Australia , The Netherlands and few others .
And in all of those countries , you can see ,
Now , places that didn &apos;t do this -- New York City for example ,
she was going to have pick up the costs
So what we &apos;ve been doing in the United States
is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data .
needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them .
Now , the ones that show that needle programs aren &apos;t effective --
you think that &apos;s one of these annoying dynamic slides
and I &apos;m going to press my dongle and the rest of it &apos;s going to come up ,
Except that , wait a minute , politicians are rational , too ,
and they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .
and not quite so well to things like this .
who think somehow that if you give out condoms ,
but if you do , I &apos;ve got news for you Benedict --
So , it depends on how much virus there is
And what we &apos;ve got is a very , very high level of virus
and then it bumps along at quite low levels
for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --
you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection .
is essentially determined by how many partners you have
because it means that you have to talk about
whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing ,
there are groups that are more likely to turnover
large numbers of partners in a short space of time .
people who sell sex and their more regular partners .
and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
we &apos;ve got basically nothing going on in the general population --
in these other populations who are at highest risk :
And you &apos;ll note , that &apos;s the local data from Los Angeles :
Of course , you can &apos;t get HIV just by having unprotected sex .
condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent
And , again , it &apos;s because of an alignment of the incentives .
because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another STI .
And , actually , clients don &apos;t want to go home with a drip either .
quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex .
or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things ,
And he &apos;s probably not having a lot of sex right now ,
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder
of why you might want to be having sex , perhaps .
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
some people say , &quot; Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter very much
So , if you look at the viremia thing again ,
But compared to what ? What happens if you &apos;re not on treatment ?
And all of this green stuff here , including the spikes --
which are because you couldn &apos;t get to the pharmacy ,
or you ran out of drugs , or you went on a three day party binge
or because you &apos;ve started to get resistance , or whatever --
Now , am I saying , &quot; Oh , well , great prevention strategy .
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .
But what I am doing is calling into question
and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men
in rich countries where treatment has been widely available
that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment
and his viral load &apos;s going to be low , so I &apos;m pretty safe . &quot;
And the other thing is that people are simply
having to use a condom every time you have sex ,
If we look at the data , we can see that
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --
you &apos;ve really got nothing much going on after treatment begins ,
It means that the combined effect of being less worried
and having more virus out there in the population --
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
We &apos;ve talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days ,
good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers ,
unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies .
transgressive people whose behaviors we don &apos;t want to condone
and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives .
I want to give what &apos;s very nearly the last word to Ines .
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta ;
because she doesn &apos;t have any better option , etc . , etc .
And if we could just teach her to sew
and get her a nice job in a factory , all would be well .
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia :
I do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them
So it &apos;s not a great job , but for a lot of people
We &apos;ve got the tools , the knowledge and the cash ,
Elizabeth Pisani : &quot; When you get to politics , nothing makes sense . &quot;
So , from the point of view of a sex worker ,
From the point of view of a public health nerd ,
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
There are as many different ways of being rational
and that &apos;s one of the glories of human existence .
because of a stupid decision that &apos;s made by a politician ,
We &apos;re not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders .
and everyone who &apos;s watching this out there on the web ,
I think , has a duty to demand of their politicians
and I witnessed , as a reporter for Al Jazeera ,
I covered another war -- the war in Iraq .
I was placed at the center of that war
are we going to live in order to see
a change that does not come through foreign intervention ,
The Iraqis : yes , they got rid of Saddam Hussein ,
&quot; Would you like to see the situation of Iraq ?
Would you like to see civil war , sectarian killing ?
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? &quot;
this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in ,
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .
in our nations in that part of the world ,
and empowered us to go down to the streets .
and say , &quot; We would like to see the end of the regime . &quot;
People who were inspired to go down to the streets
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
This is what they were telling . This is their propaganda .
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia .
But we found that these people in the street ,
that received all this kind of input from ordinary people --
people who are connected and people who have ambition
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .
because of many problems that we are suffering from .
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --
And you have many other countries trying to see
because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
that is happening right now in the Arab world .
This is the right moment , and this is the actual moment
that we see all of these meanings meet together
ordinary person who I don &apos;t know -- from Tahrir Square .
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West --
that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time
and in order to celebrate with the people of that region
Chris Anderson : I just have a couple of questions for you .
Wadah Khanfar : Actually , this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered .
We have covered a lot of tragedies , a lot of problems ,
a lot of conflict zones , a lot of hot spots in the region ,
because we were centered at the middle of it .
But this is a story -- it is a great story ; it is beautiful .
You are witnessing the birth of a new era .
CA : There are a lot of people in the West
or think this may just be an intermediate stage
that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now ,
that espouses some of the values you &apos;ve spoken about so inspiringly ?
and they are trying to put it on a track
In my opinion , these people are much more wiser
At this moment in time , the youth in the Arab world
CA : We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way .
do if they want to connect or make a difference
WK : I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --
we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time
But I can tell you , this is the moment to celebrate
to create a much better future for all of us .
CA : Well Wadah , a group of members of the TED community ,
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
She was 105 years old when I took this picture .
She was always saying things that made me stop and think , like ,
&quot; Time may be a great healer , but it ain &apos;t no beauty specialist . &quot;
Let &apos;s see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together .
And I &apos;m going to have Michael Manring play bass with me .
a few more jumps and I &apos;ll be with her .
Now you &apos;ve got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom , North Carolina .
I &apos;d go up and learn these old songs from her .
And I &apos;d pull her out on the front porch .
Down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule .
And we &apos;d sing this old song . She didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy ,
so I &apos;d sing , &quot; Hey , hey ! &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; Black-eyed Susie . &quot;
Oh , hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion .
Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey !
Oh , hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
When I was going to college at University of California
at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies ,
taking majors in biology and art , he came to the campus .
but near the end of the concert , he played the old timing style of banjo picking
It &apos;s called claw-hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
I went up to him and said , how can I learn that ?
He said , well , you can go back to Clinch Mountain , where I &apos;m from ,
Because there &apos;s a lot of old people still living that play that old style .
I just fell in love with the culture and the people .
And you know , I came back to school , I finished my degrees
and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player .
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures
Just a few of them , but maybe you &apos;ll get just a little hint of some of these folks .
And play a little banjo . Let &apos;s do a little medley .
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks , who just passed away last year .
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers .
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this ,
you could hardly understand him . But it was really wonderful .
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built .
No running water , no electricity . A wonderful , wonderful guy .
I &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that I &apos;ve done
of some of the other folks I didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
This instrument came up in those pictures . It &apos;s called the mouth bow .
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world ,
Now , the old timers didn &apos;t take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this .
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up .
It was hard on the cats , but it made a great little instrument .
Well , have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy
about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys ?
You take Kate , I &apos;ll take Sal ; we &apos;ll both have a Johnson gal .
When the Yankees saw them coming , they &apos;d lay down their guns and hide .
You take Kate , I &apos;ll take Sal ; we &apos;ll both have a Johnson gal .
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville , Texas ,
where I grew up in the early part of my life .
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store .
My mom was driving ; my brother and I were in the back seat .
We were really mad at my mom . We looked out the window .
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields .
You see , we &apos;d just been to the grocery store ,
and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine
that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it .
Well , my mom didn &apos;t put up with much either , and she was driving , and she said ,
&quot; You boys ! You think you can have anything you want .
You don &apos;t know how hard it is to earn money . Your dad works so hard .
You think money grows on trees . You &apos;ve never worked a day in your lives .
You boys make me so mad . You &apos;re going to get a job this summer . &quot;
She pulled the car over ; she said , &quot; Get out of the car . &quot;
My brother and I stepped out of the car .
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton .
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking .
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders . She marched us out in the field .
&quot; I &apos;ve got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives . &quot;
Well , that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman :
put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field
about 10 feet long , about that big around , and we started picking .
Now , cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers .
And my brother and I started to pick it ,
and our hands were startin &apos; to bleed , and then -- &quot; Mom ! &quot;
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this .
Well , the foreman could see he was in over his head , I guess .
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice .
He just sang : &quot; Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
And from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang :
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot;
Now , my brother and I had never heard anything like that
We sat there all day picking cotton , without complaining ,
&quot; Oh , Mary , don &apos;t you weep , don &apos;t you moan &quot; and &quot; Wade in the water , &quot;
and &quot; I done done , &quot; &quot; This little light of mine . &quot;
we &apos;d each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton .
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar ,
but my mother would never let us cash it .
Now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
But if you have children , you know it doesn &apos;t often work that way .
was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again .
But I also learned that some people in this world
do have to work that hard every day , and that was an eye-opener .
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier .
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can .
Now , I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day
when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field .
I wasn &apos;t even aware of music -- not even aware of it .
But that day in the cotton field out there picking ,
I realized I was in the very heart of real music ,
and that &apos;s where I &apos;ve wanted to be ever since .
You sing : Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me --
It &apos;s been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton , isn &apos;t it ?
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
It was a few years ago , but I sort of remembered this story ,
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself , of course ,
but after the concert she came up and she said ,
I set it up with the foreman . I set it up with the owner of the land .
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work .
I didn &apos;t know it was going to make you fall in love with music though . &quot;
Well , this is the steel guitar . It &apos;s an American-made instrument .
who later on made the Dobro , which is a wood-bodied instrument
with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from .
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s ,
before they had electric guitars , trying to make a loud guitar .
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck ,
just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well .
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect .
Break it off , put it on your finger , and slide into the notes .
Fifteen years ago , 14 years ago , I guess , this year ,
my wife and I lost our daughter , Sarah Jane , in a car accident ,
and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world .
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was
just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive .
I had to sit down and make lists , because I was ready to go ;
I was ready to check out of this world .
And you know , at the top of the list , of course ,
were Jenny , and my son , Zeb , my parents -- I didn &apos;t want to hurt them .
But then , when I thought about it beyond that ,
I didn &apos;t care about -- I had a radio show ,
I have a radio show on public radio , &quot; Riverwalk , &quot;
I didn &apos;t care about that . I didn &apos;t care about awards or money or anything .
seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring , the smell of new-mown hay ,
catching a wave and bodysurfing , the touch of a baby &apos;s hand ,
listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon .
And for me , the sound of a steel guitar ,
because one of my parents &apos; neighbors just gave me one of these things .
And I would sit around with it , and I didn &apos;t know how to play it ,
but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play .
And it was the only instrument that , of all the ones that I play ,
This is a song that came out of that .
If you want to talk about it , you know , I will listen to you through .
Words no longer say it ; let me tell you what I always do .
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .
While you can hardly move , they &apos;re running around having all kinds of fun .
Sometimes I think it &apos;s better just to sink way down in your funky mood
&apos;til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues .
Now , you can try to keep it all inside
but you know that &apos;s not going to get you where you want to get .
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose .
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues .
Oh , I think I &apos;ve got time to tell you about this . My dad was an inventor .
We moved to California when Sputnik went up , in 1957 .
he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney .
to become some of the inventors of computer animation .
Michael &apos;s dad was working on something called the computer .
This was 1957 , I was a little 10-year-old kid ;
I didn &apos;t know what that was . But he took me down to see one ,
you know , what they were making . It was like a library ,
just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see ,
some day you &apos;re going to be able to put this thing in your pocket .
I thought , damn , those are going to be some big pants !
So that Christmas -- maybe I &apos;ve got time for this --
that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set .
Well , I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad ; so did Michael .
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see :
Man , we were only 10 , but we knew that made gunpowder .
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway
and we threw a match and phew , it flared up . Ah , it was great .
Well , obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon .
his dad had all kinds of stuff , and we put a pipe in the vice there ,
and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe ,
drilled a hole in the back of the pipe , took some of our firecrackers ,
pulled out the fuses , tied them together , put them in the back there ,
and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder
down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top , in the garage .
We weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper .
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen .
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
That was Pacific Palisades ; it probably is still there , back there .
Well , my brother heard that we had made gunpowder .
He and his buddies , they were older , and they were pretty mean .
They said they were going to beat us up
We said , well , what are you going to do with it ?
They said , we &apos;re going to melt it down and make rocket fuel .
So we made them a big batch , and it was in my --
now , we &apos;d just moved here . We &apos;d just moved to California .
Mom had redone the kitchen ; Mom was gone that day . We had a pie tin .
It became Chris Berquist &apos;s job to do the melting down .
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen .
He said , &quot; Yeah , hey , it &apos;s melting . Yeah , the sulfur &apos;s melting .
It just flared up , and he turned around , and he looked like this .
There were big welts all over my mom &apos;s kitchen cabinet ;
the air was the just full of black smoke .
She came home , she took that chemistry set away , and we never saw it again .
But we thought of it often , because every time she &apos;d cook tuna surprise
and I think I &apos;ll close out my set with something I invented a good while back .
When drum machines were new , I got to thinking ,
why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest form of music , the hambone rhythms ,
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit .
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday ;
I &apos;m going to be doing some of the same ones .
I have a trigger here , trigger here , here , here . Right there .
It &apos;s going to really hurt if I don &apos;t take that off . Okay .
Now , the drum triggers go out my tail here , into the drum machine ,
So let me put them all together . And also , I can change the sounds
by stepping on this pedal right here , and --
let me just close out here by doing you a little
So , about three years ago I was in London ,
and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said ,
and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
We have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
Three years later , we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
in Waterloo , Ontario . It &apos;s the most exciting job I閳ユ獫e ever had .
And it &apos;s the first time I閳ユ獫e had a job where I &apos;m afraid to go away
because of everything that &apos;s going to happen in this week when I &apos;m here .
But in any case , what I &apos;m going to do in my little bit of time
is take you on a quick tour of some of the things
So , we think a lot about what really makes science work ?
is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method
On the other hand , somehow we manage to reason together
And this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do .
because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
I &apos;m not going to read them all to you because I &apos;m not in teacher mode .
who is part of the community gets to fight and argue
as hard as they can for what they believe .
that the only people who are going to decide , you know ,
are the people in our community in the next generation ,
and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere ,
And being in this process of being in a community
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science
and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy ,
between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is ,
and how people think about the society that they live in .
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution .
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science
The earth is in the center , then there are these crystal spheres ,
the sun , the moon , the planets and finally the celestial sphere ,
where the stars are . And everything in this universe has a place .
goes to its natural place , which was of course ,
the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in ,
and more importantly , the medieval society that , through Christianity ,
Where something is , is defined with respect to this last sphere ,
the celestial sphere , outside of which is this eternal ,
Now , in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about
space and time and motion and so forth of Newton .
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand ,
and a society on the other hand , were closely related .
In a Newtonian universe , there &apos;s no center -- thank you .
with respect to a fixed , absolute framework of space and time .
It &apos;s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space ,
because that &apos;s defined , not with respect to say , where other things are ,
but with respect to this absolute notion of space ,
who have certain rights , properties in a formal sense ,
and those are defined with respect to some absolute ,
abstract notions of rights and justice , and so forth ,
which are independent of what else has happened in the society .
Of who else there is , of the history and so forth .
who is in a certain sense outside the universe ,
because he has no role in anything that happens ,
because space is just the way that God knows
So this is the foundations of what &apos;s called , traditionally ,
Now , in the 20th century we had a revolution
that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century ,
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory
of space and time and gravity , is the culmination of that ,
And in this universe there &apos;s nothing fixed and absolute . Zilch , OK .
This universe is described by being a network of relationships .
Space is just one aspect , so there &apos;s no meaning to say
There &apos;s only where it is relative to everything else that is .
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .
And also , if you閳ユ獧e embedded in such a network of relationships ,
your view of the world has to do with what information
or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything .
So this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
This is also , if you talk to legal scholars ,
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view .
So the main slogan here is that there &apos;s nothing outside the universe ,
if you come upon something that &apos;s ordered and structured ,
&quot; guys &quot; in physics , by the way , is a generic term : men and women .
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was , somehow it made itself .
Because there &apos;s no place to put a maker outside ,
as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe .
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization .
Now , Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization
that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see .
would only make sense in such a relational universe .
and wouldn &apos;t really make sense in a Newtonian universe .
So a theory of biology based on natural selection
And if you push that all the way down , really ,
it makes the best sense in a relational universe
that gravity is the result of the world being relational .
If it wasn &apos;t for gravity , there wouldn &apos;t be life ,
because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time ,
keeping pieces of the world , like the surface of the Earth ,
out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve .
we saw the independent development of two big themes in science .
the implications of the notion that order and complexity
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth .
And slowly , that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences ,
And what we閳ユ獫e been working out is the implications , really ,
of the idea that the universe is made up of relations .
and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world ,
and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve .
Now , if you think about democracy from this perspective ,
a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes
that there are many different interests , many different agendas ,
And you understand some things better than other things ,
And I also think that science will never go away and --
In fact , I &apos;m finished . Science will never go away .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know ,
for a book , which was turned into a movie ,
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown ,
on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie
and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the pun --
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven &apos;s First and Fourth symphonies ,
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way
and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series ,
all because of the treacherous first violin passage work
And we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later
saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy
and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
But as a result now , he is prone to
exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation
when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --
he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes ,
and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
that he was going to sink into one of his states ,
and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical ,
a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music
And in a miracle , he lifted his own violin
which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn ,
from Bart璐竗 , all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen .
but he related to this music at a personal level .
He spoke about it with the kind of passion
And I understood that this was the very essence of art .
This was the very reason why we made music ,
that we take something that exists within all of us
through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
music brought him back into a fold of friends .
Robert Gupta : I &apos;m going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists .
Every seven years , I close it for one year
I originally had opened the studio in New York
and for even more that you &apos;ve never heard of .
As I realized , just like with many many things in my life
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
So I decided to close it down for one year .
in the first 25 years of our lives learning ,
And then tacked on at the end of it
to basically cut off five of those retirement years
that the work that comes out of these years
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago ,
I can see my work as a job . I do it for money .
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays .
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism .
But at the same time , there will be periods when I think
is all that really hard work really worth my while ?
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City .
because I knew them too well . So Asia it was .
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on , so Bali it was .
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself .
to be able to get back to all the wild dogs
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts .
And all the stuff I could afford , I didn &apos;t like .
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali
This one , of course , still works with the wild dogs .
And I think by the time this lamp came about ,
Then there is a coffee table . I also did a coffee table .
Then this is a fairly talkative , verbose kind of chair .
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali .
how boring it is to hear about other people &apos;s happinesses .
So I will not really go too far into it .
that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .
he is right now the best chef in the world
If I look at my cycle , seven years , one year sabbatical ,
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine ,
sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M .
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ?
So I &apos;m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
Talk to them about if it was successful or not .
finding out about what I &apos;m going to like in the future ,
my very best way is to talk to people
the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book .
And then I told as many , many people as I possibly could about it
so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on .
I had thought that I should do this without any plan ,
those I all said no to , but other little requests .
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that .
made a list of the things I was interested in ,
put them in a hierarchy , divided them into chunks of time
and then made a plan , very much like in grade school .
What does it say here ? Monday , 8 to 9 : story writing ;
Was not very successful . And so on and so forth .
of the first sabbatical , worked really well for me .
Financially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful .
Because of the improved quality , we could ask for higher prices .
came out of thinking of that one single year .
that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same
works for a very very few strand of companies ,
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica ,
And even though I desired to do an identity
out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto , where
he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning .
And I understood that the building itself was a logo .
by having a friend of mine write a piece of software ,
You put any image in there , like that Beethoven image .
will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo .
Which , when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster ,
comes in handy , because the visual information of the logo
So it will always fit together , conceptually , of course .
If Zappa &apos;s music is performed , it gets its own logo .
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director ,
whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards .
And one of the handy things that came about
You can take the shape and make typography out of it .
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house ,
Second insight . So far , until that point I had
And the whole series of work came out of it .
under the title &quot; Things I &apos;ve Learned in My Life So Far . &quot;
on the opening day in this gallery in New York .
And you see the self confidence almost comes back ,
gave us a plaza and asked us to do something .
And with the help of 100 volunteers , over a week ,
&quot; Should I really take as much money as I can ?
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now ? &quot;
a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza
got very close to it and quite loved it .
and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry ,
And they swept it all up and put it into custody
I think you see , you see them sweeping . You see them sweeping right here .
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali .
So we asked the goose to do it again ,
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest .
So we asked those guys to do it again .
So of course whatever you don &apos;t really do yourself
That film we &apos;ll be working on for the next two years .
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space ,
Our work is across media . The work comes in all shapes and sizes .
It &apos;s small and large . This is an ashtray , a water glass .
The thing that all the work has in common
is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space .
conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity .
that &apos;s used in the service of creating a particular special effect .
And that is something like nothing , or something next to nothing .
It &apos;s done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference
This is an image that won us a competition
for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context ,
just a mass of atomized water , a big cloud .
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation
of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions ,
which feeds , or has been feeding , our insatiable appetite
for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity .
High definition , in our opinion , has become the new orthodoxy .
And we ask the question , can we use technology , high technology ,
to make an expo pavilion that &apos;s decidedly low definition ,
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin ,
So this is how we sought to do it .
and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles ,
35,000 of them . And a weather station is on the structure .
and it processes this data in a central computer
And it &apos;s a responsive system that &apos;s trained on actual weather .
So , this is just in construction , and there &apos;s a tensegrity structure .
It &apos;s about 300 feet wide , the size of a football field ,
and it sits on just four very delicate columns .
and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather ,
So , we &apos;re very interested in creating weather . I don &apos;t know why .
you can see what the quality of the space was .
entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium .
leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles .
where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do .
And we pride ourselves -- it &apos;s a spectacular anti-spectacle
in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head .
are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention
that &apos;s sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog .
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way .
So here the world is put out of focus ,
and then just come down under those lips into the water bar .
So , all the waters of the world are served there ,
so we thought that , you know , after being at the water
and moving through the water and breathing the water ,
but it goes a little bit , you know , deeper than that .
and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses .
You know , when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell ,
because the Swiss said , &quot; Well , why are we going to spend , you know ,
that we already have in natural abundance that we hate ? &quot;
And , you know , we thought -- well , we tried to convince them .
And in the end , you know , they adapted this as a national icon
that came to represent Swiss doubt , which we -- you know ,
that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of .
Anyway , it &apos;s a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed ,
and so it &apos;s now a memory of an apparition , actually ,
to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar .
So in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , we were mostly known for independent work ,
In 2003 , the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work
that featured a lot of this work from the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
However , the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective ,
and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show .
This was a piece on tourism in the United States .
&quot; Master / Slave &quot; at the MOMA , the project series , a piece called &quot; Parasite . &quot;
And so there were many , many of these kinds of projects .
Anyway , they gave us the whole fourth floor , and , you know ,
that &apos;s supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding
And our work doesn &apos;t really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .
And one of the recurring themes , by the way , that in the work
was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself ,
and asking about the conventions of the museum , like the wall , the white wall .
is basically a plan of many installations that were put there .
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time .
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project
and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation .
the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element ,
which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --
which was a robotic drill , basically , that went all the way around ,
cruised the museum , went all around the walls and did a lot of damage .
So , the drill was mounted on this robotic arm .
We worked with , by the way , Honeybee Robotics . This is the brain .
and it was really very much fun to work with them .
They weren &apos;t doing their primary work , which was for the government ,
In any case , the way it works is that
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix .
It selects a point , it guides the drill to that point , it pierces the dry wall ,
leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location .
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned ,
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall .
in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element .
And there was also this constant background groan , which was very annoying .
where there &apos;s a video piece that became totally not useful .
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display ,
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text .
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago .
It &apos;s the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston ,
And there &apos;s not enough time to really introduce the building ,
between this outwardly focused nature of the site --
you know , it &apos;s a really great waterfront site in Boston --
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum .
So , the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --
So , you come in and you &apos;re basically squeezed by the theater ,
by the belly of the theater , into this very compressed space
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall .
This elevator &apos;s about the size of a New York City studio apartment .
which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop .
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open .
and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view .
which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out .
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries
the intention was really to not get a climax ,
so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other .
This was eliminated because the view was too good ,
and the mayor said , &quot; No , we just want this open . &quot;
But culminating -- and that &apos;s where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --
which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building .
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it &apos;s quite substantial .
and then from that is this , is this small area called the Mediatheque .
and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web .
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building ,
this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device ,
it only edits the harbor view , the industrial harbor
just through its walls , its floors and its ceiling ,
to only expose the water itself , the texture of water ,
much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence
of the technological and the natural in the project .
But there is just no information , it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just hypnosis .
These are the guys that did the project in the first place , 50 years ago .
We &apos;re taking over now , doing work that ranges in scale
from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions .
But we &apos;re doing it with a lot less testosterone .
This is the extent of the work that &apos;s to be completed by 2010 .
I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that &apos;s even a part of a project
that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects ,
and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction .
It &apos;s Alice Tully Hall , and it &apos;s tucked under the Juilliard Building
So , this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be ,
And we asked ourselves , why couldn &apos;t it be exhibitionistic ,
like the Met , or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center ?
And one of the things that we were asked to do
was give it a street identity , expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible .
And this building , which is just naturally hermetic , we stripped .
where we &apos;re framing with this kind of canopy --
the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard ,
about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway ,
and then exposing , using that canopy to frame Tully Hall .
Wait a minute , it &apos;s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left
which is kind of where we &apos;re really doing a massive amount of work .
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall .
Now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons
and small-scale performances . They asked us to bring an intimacy .
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall ?
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things .
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy .
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall .
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall .
It &apos;s like a coffin , it basically sends all the sound ,
This is Avery Fisher Hall , but the notion of junk -- visual junk --
was very , very important to us , to get rid of visual noise .
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation ,
to take away the distraction of the subway noise .
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --
But it &apos;s acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house
and back to the stage . And here &apos;s an acoustic shelf .
Looking up the hall . Just a section of the stage .
So now that we &apos;ve stripped the hall of all visual distraction ,
which is supposed to connect the house , the audience ,
one piece of architectural excess , a special effect : lighting .
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall
is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect ,
which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls .
And what it entails is the use of resin , of this very thick resin
with a veneer of the same kind of wood that &apos;s used throughout the hall ,
that wraps the hall in light , like a belt of light : rather than separating ,
like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers ,
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City
that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City ,
And for us , I mean it &apos;s really kind of a very strange thing ,
but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down
when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin ,
very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier ,
the walls will just exude this glow , temporarily stealing attention from the stage .
I have no ending to say , except that I &apos;m a couple of minutes over .
I don &apos;t know how you keep it up , Chris , I really don &apos;t .
So nice , all week . He &apos;s the kind of man you could say to ,
And it gets worse , I crashed it into your house .
And what &apos;s more , your wife has just run off with your best friend . &quot;
And you know that Chris would say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
&quot; Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn &apos;t know existed . Thank you . &quot;
One of the -- Thank you for inviting us .
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that ,
all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say .
Nuclear fusion , I had about 10 minutes on that .
And so this morning I thought , &quot; Oh well , I &apos;ll just do a card trick . &quot;
And today is Emmanuel &apos;s day , I think we &apos;ve agreed that , already , haven &apos;t we ?
I was planning on finishing on a dance ...
So , what I thought I &apos;d do is -- in honor of Emmanuel --
is , what I can do is to launch today the first
If I could start , this is the Enigma decoding machine .
he said , &quot; No , don &apos;t go through this . Don &apos;t , please don &apos;t .
they said somewhere in the thing , they said , &quot; 15 minutes to change the world ,
your moment onstage . &quot; 15 minutes to change the world .
I don &apos;t know about you , it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug .
So , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one .
Well , of course now we know we don &apos;t have to change a plug ,
of the wireless electric -- fantastic . You know , it inspires us .
300 years ago he &apos;d have been burnt at the stake for that .
people who look at the world in a totally different way .
who covered most of what I was going to say .
But when you think of the world in that way ,
it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience , don &apos;t you think ?
I mean , he must walk in and they will say ,
&quot; Would you mind if I serve the next customer ? &quot;
Her talk about the aquatic ape , and the link , of course ,
and the fact that we are all naked beneath this --
we &apos;re not hirsute and we can swim rather well .
And she said , you know , she &apos;s 90 . She &apos;s running out of time , she said .
And she &apos;s desperate to find more evidence for the link .
And I think , &quot; I &apos;m sitting next to Lewis Pugh . &quot;
This man has swum around the North Pole , what more evidence do you want ?
I wasn &apos;t here on Tuesday . I didn &apos;t actually see Gordon Brown &apos;s
The problem I have is because Gordon Brown , he comes onstage
and he looks for all the world like a man
who &apos;s just taken the head off a bear suit .
: &quot; Hello , can I tell you what happened in the woods back there ?
&quot; I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world ,
I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , unfortunately I &apos;m not able to tell you about
all the wonderful things we &apos;re doing to promote the climate change agenda
like the third runway we &apos;re planning at Heathrow Airport ... &quot;
and of course the exciting news that only today ,
&quot; Although to be honest , when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem . &quot;
I just , can I just say a few things about ,
Gordon and I , we always got on perfectly well .
&quot; You know , I wrote to him , just before I left office . I said ,
&apos;Can I rely on your support for the next month ? &apos;
And he wrote back . He said , &apos; No , you can &apos;t.&apos;
Which kind of surprised me , because I &apos;d never seen &apos; can &apos;t &apos; spelled that way before . &quot;
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech
that was to the building ; the people weren &apos;t listening .
But the people , when talking about the finance industry , he said ,
&quot; What you as the city of London have done for financial services ,
we , as a government , hope to do for the economy as a whole . &quot;
and you see what &apos;s happened to the economy , you think ,
&quot; Well , there is a man who delivers on his promises . &quot;
But we &apos;re in a new world now . We &apos;re in a completely new world .
This is the first time that I can remember , where if you get a letter
from the bank manager about a loan , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re borrowing
money from him , or if he &apos;s borrowing money from you .
Why would you do that ? Why would -- It &apos;s like one step up
from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
And , you know , Iceland , it was never going to cut it .
What does it have ? It has fish , that &apos;s all .
That &apos;s why the Prime Minister went on television . He said ,
A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense
of things before I can make nonsense of them .
And making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
And the other one , of course , is Donald Rumsfeld , who said ,
&quot; There are the known knowns , the things we know we know .
And then you got the unknown unknowns , those are the things
And being English , when I first heard that I thought , &quot; What a load of cock . &quot;
And then , you &apos;re now , well , actually , that &apos;s what this is about .
it &apos;s about -- they don &apos;t know , they didn &apos;t know what they were doing .
In 2006 , the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said , quote ,
Now , there is a man on top of his job .
And when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities
So , it &apos;s extraordinary . It &apos;s a new world that &apos;s very , very difficult to make sense of .
But we have a new hope . We have a new man .
America has now elected its first openly black President .
Not only that , he &apos;s left-handed . Have you noticed this ?
You see , a lot of the people that I most admire ,
And somebody said to me last night , you know , being left-handed ,
you have to learn to write without smudging the ink .
And I thought , what a wonderful metaphor , isn &apos;t it ? An American President who
You like that one ? As opposed to you could see
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing , wouldn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well . &quot;
That &apos;s eight years of American History , eight minutes of my act ,
&quot; You know , it &apos;s the end of an error &#91; sic &#93; .
I happen to believe it was a great error .
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda .
&quot; But I have a message for the suicide bombers ,
&quot; We &apos;re going to make sure you don &apos;t do it again . &quot;
But now he &apos;s gone , and it &apos;s great to see one of the --
now given way to one of the greatest , in Obama .
You were there , maybe , on the night of his victory .
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago , he said ,
I can &apos;t do the whole thing because it would take too long , it really would .
But you get the picture . And then it goes to the inauguration .
And he and the Chief Justice , they trip over each other ,
they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up .
And there is George Bush sitting there going , &quot; Heh heh heh heh ... &quot;
But the interesting thing is , Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero ,
who said , people would listen to a speech , they said , &quot; Great speech . &quot;
And we all want to believe in President Obama .
It &apos;s rather like that line in the film &quot; As Good As it Gets . &quot;
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson ,
and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson , &quot; What do you see in me ? &quot;
&quot; You make me want to be a better man . &quot;
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges
and makes you want to be a better citizen . Right ?
We like what Barack Obama says , but we don &apos;t do anything about it .
So he comes over to this country , and he says ,
and the French and the Germans go , &quot; No , no , forget about that ,
He says , &quot; We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan . &quot;
He leaves , people go , &quot; No no no , we &apos;re not going to do that .
5,000 maximum , and no rockets . No , no , not going to do it . &quot;
He goes to Prague , he says , &quot; We believe in a nuclear-free world . &quot;
And it &apos;s great to have an American president who can say the word &quot; nuclear , &quot;
So , where do we look for inspiration ? We &apos;ve still got Bill Clinton .
&quot; I believe , I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ... &quot;
&quot; Make this world a better place , if you can .
And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House ,
because she &apos;d have been out of our home for four years .
&quot; So , when that didn &apos;t work out I had to make a few arrangements , let me tell you . &quot;
So , there &apos;s him . In Britain we have Prince Charles :
&quot; And the environment is so important , all we can do .
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to
Or , any South Africans , we have Mandela to inspire .
was a visit from the team from Ground Force , a gardening program .
&quot; So , Nelson , how would you like a nice water feature ? &quot;
Very quickly : I wasn &apos;t quite sure how to end this talk
and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote
which said it &apos;s nice to have something which is unfinished
because it implies there is still room for growth .
Some 17 years ago , I became allergic to Delhi &apos;s air .
and take them outdoors every three to four months .
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
you can grow all the fresh air you need .
with a cap on top , and you would not die at all ,
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
going up by one percent if one stays indoors
that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi .
lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent .
And this study has been published on September 8 , 2008,
and it &apos;s available on the government of India website .
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings
by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air .
with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
&quot; Be the change you want to see in the world , &quot;
Pat Mitchell : What is the story of this pin ?
That was well chosen , I would say , for TEDWomen .
MA : Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning
is trying to figure out what is going to happen .
And none of this pin stuff would have happened
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador ,
were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly ,
which he deserved -- he had invaded another country .
And so all of a sudden , a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad
And so I happened to have a snake pin .
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq .
And when I went out to meet the press ,
they zeroed in , said , &quot; Why are you wearing that snake pin ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent . &quot;
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins
what I thought we were going to do on any given day .
And it goes with a book that says , &quot; Read My Pins . &quot;
the thing that happens to a lot of women ,
So how do you feel about that -- the whole --
because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had .
before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador ,
I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick , who &apos;d been ambassador before me ,
and she said , &quot; You &apos;ve got to get rid of your professor clothes .
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping .
about -- &quot; did you wear a hat ? &quot; &quot; How short was your skirt ? &quot;
if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots ,
And no guy ever gets criticized . But that &apos;s the least of it .
PM : It is , for all of us , men and women ,
and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world
MA : Well the interesting part was I was asked
what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State
And I said , &quot; Well I &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years ,
but I &apos;ve only been Secretary of State for a few minutes . &quot;
and I think there will probably be some people in the audience
I went to my first meeting , first at the U.N. ,
And I &apos;m sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --
and I thought -- well you know how we all are .
You want to get the feeling of the room ,
And all of a sudden I thought , &quot; Well , wait a minute .
I am sitting behind a sign that says &apos; The United States , &apos;
then the voice of the United States will not be heard , &quot;
and it was the first time that I had that feeling
and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country .
but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways
of telling it like it is when it &apos;s necessary .
But I have to tell you , I have my youngest granddaughter ,
&quot; So what &apos;s the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State ?
PM : Because in her lifetime -- MA : That would be so .
this global narrative around the story of women and girls ?
And therefore it means that we have to remember
that , while many of us have had huge opportunities --
and Pat , you have been a real leader in your field --
and understanding that women have to help other women .
that women &apos;s issues had to be central to American foreign policy ,
but because I believe that societies are better off
where we do have economic and political voice --
both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State .
from making that a central tenant of foreign policy ?
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
because they are the ones that have to do with life and death
it is really central to the way that we think about things .
a lot of them , the women were the main victims of it .
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal
And by the way , one of the things that I did at that stage
and when I was there , there were 183 countries in the U.N.
But it was one of the first times that I didn &apos;t have to cook lunch myself .
And I thought when I &apos;d get to my apartment
I get there , and there are six other women , out of 183 .
So being an American , I decided to set up a caucus .
was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war ,
when they weren &apos;t , when there was maybe you --
Do you believe , and can you tell us why ,
MA : Well I do think , when there are more women ,
So for instance , what I did when I went to Burundi ,
I think we &apos;re better about putting ourselves into the other guy &apos;s shoes
I think it helps in terms of the support
And so it was nice when one of them would show up .
For instance , she is now the president of Finland ,
but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland
and , at a certain stage , head of the European Union .
Because one of the things I think you &apos;ll understand .
when I would say , &quot; Well I feel we should do something about this , &quot;
and they &apos;d say , &quot; What do you mean , you feel ? &quot;
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me .
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control ,
and she said , &quot; Well I feel we should do this . &quot;
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden .
The other thing that I think is really important :
when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
this balance we &apos;re looking for , then , in the world ?
MA : Well I think one of the things --
and just make sure that women help each other .
believe it or not , there were other women who criticized me :
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty .
In fact , I think &quot; guilt &quot; is every woman &apos;s middle name .
And my motto is that there &apos;s a special place in hell
PM : Well Secretary Albright , I guess you &apos;ll be going to heaven .
with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years
and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness ,
But in spite of all this flood of work ,
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness ,
because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .
because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it ,
this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up
and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ;
and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness .
and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people
It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --
&quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score ,
or &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; or something like that .
and getting confused between them is part of the mess
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
that is , what we get to keep from our experiences
I won &apos;t go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful these days ,
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot;
and every minute of pain that Patient A had ,
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ;
And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
From the point of view of the experiencing self ,
and it has been done , and it does work --
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes ,
and you have the remembering self of Patient A
and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
It has moments of experience , one after the other .
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
I mean , most of the moments of our life --
in a life there are about 600 million of them ;
From the point of view of the experiencing self ,
and the second week is just as good as the first ,
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
because , if you have a patient who has had , say ,
is the one that has the memory that is less bad ,
we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self ,
And this is a bit hard to justify I think .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation
which was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had ,
relative to how much I think of other vacations .
my memories of that three-week trip , I would say ,
for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
and that is at most an hour and a half .
Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know ,
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories ,
Why do we put so much weight on memory
relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
you know that at the end of the vacation
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict ,
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self ,
This is not about how happily a person lives .
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is
is going to mess up the study of happiness ,
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being ,
who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
and there have been other efforts along those lines .
So in recent years , we have begun to learn
And the main lesson I think that we have learned
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life ,
Just to give you a sense of the correlation ,
and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot;
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten ,
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves ,
is that we really should not think of happiness
is that we do not attend to the same things
when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California ,
you are not going to get to the correct answer .
and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self
But now , because the reflective self is in charge ,
you may end up -- some people may end up
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
But one thing will happen : They will think they are happier ,
they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio ,
and they will feel they made the right decision .
and I hope I have given you a sense
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago ,
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result
since you do have a few moments left now ?
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey
is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000,
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
In terms of the other self , the remembering self ,
The more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
CA : But Danny , the whole American endeavor is about
Is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally ,
DK : You know I think that there is recognition
of the role of happiness research in public policy .
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States ,
so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
goes very different ways depending on how you think ,
This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two ,
CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --
So , people argue vigorously about the definition of life .
They ask if it should have reproduction in it , or metabolism , or evolution .
And I don &apos;t know the answer to that , so I &apos;m not going to tell you .
Booted up in a cell , the program would execute ,
or with a small change , it could result in this person ;
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true ,
and computer programs that could help to convince you .
that can make large changes in biological development -- the output .
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .
is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes .
If your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit ,
So these small changes are things that I think
that -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation
So now , all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology ,
and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does .
And what I want to do is write molecular programs ,
And there are a lot of people doing this ,
a lot of synthetic biologists doing this , like Craig Venter .
and building new languages for building things from the bottom up ,
So , these are all the machines in a cell .
some switches that turn your genes on and off ,
the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA .
We &apos;re not DNA zealots , but DNA is the cheapest ,
easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this .
And as other things become easier to use --
If we succeed , what will molecular programming look like ?
You &apos;re going to sit in front of your computer .
You &apos;re going to design something like a cell phone ,
and in a high-level language , you &apos;ll describe that cell phone .
and it &apos;s going to turn it into actual molecules
and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed .
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately ,
a molecular computation , and it &apos;ll build an electronic computer .
I think that life has been about molecular computers
which will build new electronic computers , and so forth .
and you think life is about computation , as I do ,
then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .
So one big question is , how does a baby know when to stop growing ?
the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing ?
Or how does a computer program know when to stop running ?
Or more to the point , how do you know if a program will ever stop ?
Turns out I think he &apos;s actually a computer scientist .
And just as he &apos;s writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller ,
how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone ?
What &apos;s the smallest number we can get away with ?
and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions .
But for some tasks , we can start to answer them .
for the DNA structures I &apos;m going to talk about next .
So , this is normal DNA , what you think of as normal DNA .
has the As , Ts , Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together .
And I &apos;m going to draw it like this sometimes ,
We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix .
so we can take the blue strand in one tube
and make an orange strand in the other tube ,
You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix .
have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures
using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together .
But a lot of their approaches , though elegant , take a long time .
They can take a couple of years , or it can be difficult to design .
So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago
that &apos;s so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen
But to do it , you need a long , single strand of DNA ,
and he &apos;s got a double-stranded genome -- that &apos;s no good .
You look in his intestines . There are billions of bacteria .
Double strand again , but inside them , they &apos;re infected with a virus
that we can fold like a piece of paper .
We add a bunch of short , synthetic DNAs that I call staples .
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place ,
and a right half that binds it in a different place ,
The net action of many of these on that long strand
is to fold it into something like a rectangle .
Now , we can &apos;t actually take a movie of this process ,
that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it .
And what happens is that we mix these strands together .
We heat them up , we add a little bit of salt ,
we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down ,
And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .
is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other ,
by places where short strands go along one helix
So there &apos;s a strand that goes like this , goes along one helix and binds --
Now , to show that we could make any shape or pattern
that we wanted , I tried to make this shape .
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye ,
down the nose , up the nose , around the forehead ,
back down and end in a little loop like this .
And so , I thought , if this could work , anything could work .
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this .
I mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down ,
So , they &apos;re all floating around in solution , and to look at them ,
you have to get them on a surface where they stick .
and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope .
bumps up and down , and feels the height of the first surface .
and you can see that the landing &apos;s a little rough .
and some of their noses get punched out , but it &apos;s pretty good .
You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop ,
Now , what &apos;s great about this is anybody can do this .
And so , I got this in the mail about a year after I did this , unsolicited .
So , what happened is , a graduate student in China ,
a beautiful rendition of China , which even has Taiwan ,
and you can see it &apos;s sort of on the world &apos;s shortest leash , right ?
and you can make patterns as well as shapes , OK ?
And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA .
So , you can put circuit components on the staples ,
Let the thing assemble , and you &apos;ll get some kind of a circuit .
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over .
So , this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did .
They took a DNA origami , organized some carbon nano-tubes ,
made a little switch , you see here , wired it up ,
tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch .
and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go .
because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size
Now , I want to get back to that compiler .
The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .
You get a high-level description of the computer program ,
You can compile it to molecules , send it to a synthesizer ,
And it turns out that a company has made a nice program
that &apos;s much better than my code , which was kind of ugly ,
and will allow us to do this in a nice ,
why isn &apos;t DNA origami the end of the story ?
You have your molecular compiler , you can do whatever you want .
So if you want to build a human from DNA origami ,
it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami .
You zoom in , there are just four DNA strands
that can bind to other tiles , if they match .
And we like to draw these tiles as little squares .
And if you look at their sticky ends , these little DNA bits ,
you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern .
So , these tiles would make a complicated , self-assembling checkerboard .
And the point of this , if you didn &apos;t catch that ,
is that tiles are a kind of molecular program
into one of these tile programs -- specifically , counting .
So , you can come up with a set of tiles
that when they come together , form a little binary counter
So you can read off binary numbers five , six and seven .
And in order to get these kinds of computations started right ,
you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
they will start to count -- they will read that 32
So , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve figured out a way
to have a molecular program know when to stop going .
It knows when to stop growing because it can count .
So , that answers that sort of first question I was talking about .
It doesn &apos;t tell us how babies do it , however .
So now , we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things
Here &apos;s the DNA origami , and what we can do
is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami ,
and water with tiles , and we can start growing tiles off of that
to fill in a square in the middle of this thing .
in making something much bigger than a DNA origami
And the neat thing about it is , is that it &apos;s also reprogrammable .
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation
And if you do that , the origami &apos;s the same size ,
but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger .
where small changes -- single , tiny , little mutations --
is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter &apos;s question .
So , you can ask , how many DNA strands are required
If we wanted to make a square of size 10 , 100 or 1,000,
we would require a number of DNA strands that &apos;s the square
so we &apos;d need 100 , 10,000 or a million DNA strands .
we use origami , plus some tiles that count --
then we can get away with using 100 , 200 or 300 DNA strands .
And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use ,
if we use counting , if we use a little bit of computation .
to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something ,
to reduce the size of the genome that you &apos;re building .
And finally , I &apos;m going to get back to that sort of crazy idea
If you look at the square that you build with the origami
the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles --
rather than to the staple strands , you affix them to the tiles --
the demultiplexer circuits , that you need to address this memory .
Now , you ask me , how far have we gotten down this path ?
Experimentally , this is what we &apos;ve done in the last year .
One , two , three , four , five , six , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 , 17 .
So it &apos;s got some errors , but at least it counts up .
So , it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,
and that &apos;s about the time constant for how long it takes
to do these kinds of things , so I think we made a lot of progress .
We &apos;ve got ideas about how to fix these errors .
And I think in the next five or 10 years ,
we &apos;ll make the kind of squares that I described
and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits .
So now , what do I want you to take away from this talk ?
And the computations that it uses , they &apos;re molecular computations ,
and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it ,
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing ,
but what I &apos;d like you to take from the talk ,
is that this molecular programming isn &apos;t just about making gadgets .
and looking at big questions in a new light ,
? Picture yourself in a world where there &apos;s no one else , ?
? A moment ago , there were voices and faces to look upon , ?
? and no one left to say it to , anyway . ?
? and everybody is free to make a difference . ?
? Everybody is free to make a difference in this world . ?
? Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth . ?
? Now there is a reason for everyone &apos;s time on Earth . ?
? and only love can see us through , anyway . ?
? Everybody is free to make a difference . ?
? You don &apos;t have to be a big celebrity ?
? to feel the power , the power in your soul , no . ?
? You don &apos;t have to be a big star on MTV ?
? to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see . ?
? You can make a little difference in this world . ?
? I can make a little difference in this world . ?
? She can make a little difference in this world . ?
? He can make a little difference in this world . ?
? You can , I can , she can , he can , ?
? we can make a little bit of difference in this world . ?
? Talking &apos; bout everybody gonna make a little difference . ?
? Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world , ?
because I think it &apos;s difficult to be in the world
This song kind of came out of all of that .
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record ,
? No faith in God to save the day . ?
? No words of wisdom from the wise . ?
? He wants more , and more , and more , and more , ?
? and more , and more , and more , and more . ?
? There is no freedom to be free . ?
? There is no heaven , no fire and brimstone . ?
? There is no country , no one religion . ?
? and more , and more , and more , and more , and more . ?
So , I share it with all of you here today ,
Of course it helps that fear of public failure
I &apos;ve been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship
the leading real estate company in my home state , Kerala ,
In 2003 , when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector
there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams ,
and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge .
We ended up being the first medical response team
to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service
Since then I &apos;ve also co-founded two other social enterprises .
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .
With the significance being these funds have come in
as a QT capital , not as grant or as philanthropy .
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side ,
he or she does not wake up every day and say ,
&quot; Hmm , let me see who I can pay a bribe to today . &quot;
or , &quot; Let me see who I can corrupt today . &quot;
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation
that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in
In the modern day world , where time is premium
simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life .
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe
What do you do ? Of course you can call the police .
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption ?
Most definitely you don &apos;t want to pay the bribe .
have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in ,
pay a fee , and fight the demand for a bribe .
is of a grandmother , 70 plus years , being harassed
All she needed was permission to build three steps
making it easier for her to enter and exit her house .
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit
because I was busy building my real estate company .
I don &apos;t want to be haunted by such images any more .
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands
set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe .
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases
for a fee , to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe .
The target market is as tempting as it can get .
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars ,
It never has been and it never will be .
including the one perpetrated by India &apos;s biggest corporate scamster .
I have had three police cases filed against me
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on
to our dignity and making the world a fairer place .
and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs ,
I quote : &quot; Of course we cannot fail in this ,
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is . &quot; Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Shaffi , that is a really exciting business idea .
Shaffi Mather : I just have to get through the initial days where I don &apos;t get eliminated .
I mean , give us a sense of the numbers here --
a typical bribe and a typical fee . I mean , what &apos;s in your head ?
SM : So let me ... Let me give you an example .
So we actually used the Right to Information Act ,
which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States ,
and pushed back the officers in this particular case .
&quot; Oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you want to screw me . Let me show you what I can do . &quot;
So you take the next step , or use the next tool available
By the third time , in all 42 cases , we have achieved success .
CA : That &apos;s a high gross margin business . I like it .
SM : I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage .
CA : OK , so these are provisional numbers , no pricing guarantee .
If you can pull this off , you will be a global hero .
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED .
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis .
He did not , happily , follow in the footsteps of his predecessor ,
Nor did he tell us , &quot; Trust us . Trust your country .
Instead , what he told us was to put aside childish things .
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one .
This is the job description of a hospital janitor
And all of the items on it are unremarkable .
mop the floors , sweep them , empty the trash , restock the cabinets .
It may be a little surprising how many things there are ,
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this :
there isn &apos;t a single thing on it that involves other human beings .
The janitor &apos;s job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like ,
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor
because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise ,
trying to build up his strength , walking slowly up and down the hall .
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor &apos;s admonition
because there were some family members who were there all day , every day
who , at this moment , happened to be taking a nap .
who washed the floor in a comatose young man &apos;s room twice
because the man &apos;s father , who had been keeping a vigil for six months ,
And behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses
and , if we &apos;re lucky now and then , from doctors ,
Now , not all janitors are like this , of course .
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings .
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people .
And beyond this , they have the moral skill to figure out what &quot; doing right &quot; means .
&quot; is the combination of moral will and moral skill . &quot;
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule ,
as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .
A wise person is like a jazz musician --
using the notes on the page , but dancing around them ,
inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills
To serve other people , not to manipulate other people .
You need the time to get to know the people that you &apos;re serving .
try new things , occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures .
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers .
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described
how hard it is to learn to do their job ,
they tell you that it takes lots of experience .
And they don &apos;t mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans .
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people .
The good news is you don &apos;t need to be brilliant to be wise .
It &apos;s as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else .
and yet , let me tell you a little story .
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark .
and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it .
Dad , being an academic , had no idea that Mike &apos;s Hard Lemonade contained alcohol .
And the kid was drinking it , and a security guard spotted it ,
that rushed to the ballpark , whisked the kid to the hospital .
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood .
And they were ready to let the kid go .
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no .
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days .
Well , a judge said yes , but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel .
&quot; We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . &quot;
and they let a child go back to an abusive household .
When things go wrong , as of course they do ,
we reach for two tools to try to fix them .
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
Fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ?
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules ,
rules and incentives may make things better in the short run ,
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules
that destroy our desire to do the right thing .
first of rules and the war on moral skill .
and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water .
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book .
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city ,
every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day .
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity .
most of them need some notes on the page .
We need more rules for the bankers , God knows .
and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing ,
it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another
and they make people less likely to do it .
I &apos;ll just give you one example because time is racing .
they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps .
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .
And they said , &quot; Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? &quot;
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
They said , &quot; If we paid you six weeks &apos; salary every year
would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? &quot;
Two reasons . It &apos;s my responsibility and I &apos;m getting paid .
so that instead of asking , &quot; What is my responsibility ? &quot;
when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies
in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses ,
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
We need incentives . People have to make a living .
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .
&quot; We must ask not just &apos; Is it profitable ? &apos; but &apos; Is it right ? &apos; &quot;
everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives
And we certainly see it in the world of business .
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work .
One way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
There is no better way to show people that you &apos;re not serious
than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics
into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course .
that a little voice is whispering in your ear
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions .
comes the understanding that you can &apos;t acknowledge that you have moral heroes .
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember this :
who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --
3,000 employees . He kept every one of them on the payroll .
Why ? Because it would have been a disaster for them
and for the community if he had let them go .
&quot; Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street ,
but I can tell you it &apos;s worth more . We &apos;re doing fine . &quot;
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes .
-- turned , you know , a part of the evil empire
Why ? Because it was the right thing to do .
Why ? Because there happy to be doing something that &apos;s the right thing to do .
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia .
Because it took the will to do the right thing .
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill .
I &apos;m boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know
is that it took knowing the people in the communities .
Unless the people you &apos;re working with are behind you ,
And there isn &apos;t a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you ,
So there &apos;s a lot here at TED , and at other places , to celebrate .
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive
that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will .
will give up if they have to swim against the current
If you run an organization , you should be sure
that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --
have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors .
any work that you do that involves interaction with other people
as teachers , we should strive to be the ordinary heroes ,
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers .
and , in particular , the model that KIPP was providing :
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things
to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college .
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing
That is that they have come to the realization
that the single most important thing kids need to learn
And , most important , they need to learn to respect learning .
If you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill .
And the teachers : the way you teach these things to the kids
is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day .
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom ,
because it &apos;s what allows other virtues -- honesty , kindness , courage and so on --
to be displayed at the right time and in the right way .
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
In many ways , it &apos;s what TED is all about .
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us
to the structure of the organizations within which we work ,
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom
Chris Anderson : You have to go and stand out here a sec .
60 Minutes , many of you may have seen it .
And it was the now director of the entire piece
who , himself , had lost an arm 39 years ago
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background ,
after he pretty much made his position clear on this --
he had his hook and he had his --
he wore this arm for less than two hours
and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact
it &apos;s the first time he &apos;s felt like he &apos;s had an arm in 39 years .
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story ,
and I &apos;m not going to show you that polished video .
I &apos;m going to , instead , in a minute or two ,
that businesses and universities probably wouldn &apos;t take the risk of doing .
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit ,
and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down
to basically the following . We have used such advanced technologies
in the most remote places that we put soldiers :
they will have collected him or her , they will have brought him back ,
faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt
in a car accident in a major city in the United States .
The bad news is if they &apos;ve collected this person
and he or she is missing an arm or leg ,
part of the face , it &apos;s probably not coming back .
So , they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm .
And then the surgeon pointed out , with a lot of anger ,
he said , &quot; Why is it ? At the end of the Civil War ,
they were shooting each other with muskets . If somebody lost an arm ,
we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it .
we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it . &quot;
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy ,
&quot; We &apos;re going to bring a guy into this conference room ,
and wearing the arm you &apos;re going to give us ,
he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape
So he wants fine motor control : flex at the wrist ,
flex at the elbow , abduct and flex at the shoulder .
&quot; Oh , by the way Dean . It &apos;s going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame --
&quot; And it &apos;s going to be completely self contained including all its power . &quot;
So , they finished that . And I , as you can tell ,
more than two dozen of these kids have come back
Anyway , I went home that night . I thought about it .
And trust me , I &apos;ve got a day job , I &apos;ve got a lot of day jobs .
funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....
I still think they &apos;re nuts but we &apos;re going to do it .
And I told them I &apos;d build them an arm .
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA ,
Look what it takes to make things like iPods .
I said , &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . I &apos;ll build you an arm
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
I went back and I started putting a team together ,
the best guys I could find with a passion to do this .
we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom ,
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it
that &apos;s so real it &apos;s eerie , but then you wouldn &apos;t see
before we &apos;d be able to make it really , really useful .
It turned out , as I think you could see
He &apos;s literally , he &apos;s got no shoulder on one side ,
after 10 hours -- were playing in our office .
At the end of the one I &apos;m going to show , it &apos;s only about a minute
Chuck does something that to this day I &apos;m jealous of ,
as he translates it , moving all these joints simultaneously ,
to his mouth , and he doesn &apos;t drop any milk .
He &apos;s punching our controls guy . The guy behind him
This is a non-trivial thing to do , by the way .
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it ,
And now he &apos;s going to do what DARPA asked me for .
He &apos;s going to pick up a grape -- he didn &apos;t drop it ,
I &apos;ll give you some astounding things that have happened
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design ,
and we &apos;d have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make --
you can always get three out of four of anything you want ;
the weight , the size , the cost , the functionality --
I put a bunch of guys in my plane
and I said , &quot; We &apos;re flying down to Walter Reed , and we &apos;re going talk to these kids ,
because frankly it doesn &apos;t matter whether we like this arm .
When I told them that they weren &apos;t entirely enthusiastic ,
but I told them , &quot; It really doesn &apos;t matter what their opinion is .
the kids that are either going to use it or not . &quot;
I told a bunch of my engineers , &quot; Look we &apos;re going to walk into Walter Reed ,
and you &apos;re going to see people , lots of them ,
We &apos;re probably going to have to give them support , encouragement .
enough information to make sure we &apos;re doing the right thing . &quot;
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong .
a lot of them missing a lot of body parts ,
They were sitting at a table . They were brought together for us .
&quot; Look , &quot; I &apos;d say to them , &quot; We &apos;re not quite as good as nature yet .
And we were trying to get them to all help us
We &apos;re here to help you . We need data . We need to know
After a half an hour , maybe , there was one guy at the far end of the table
I called down to the end , &quot; Hey , you haven &apos;t said much .
If we needed this or this , what would you want ? &quot;
He had a great spirit , like all the rest of them had great spirits .
And then the meeting ended . We said goodbye to all these guys .
And that guy pushed himself back from the table ...
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center .
And we saw lots of these kids , lots of them .
And I get a call and we go back
and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany
He &apos;s got a small residual limb on one side .
And I turned around and went , &quot; How are we going to do this ? &quot;
Anyway , he was just like all the rest of them .
This is not a happy thing . Look , if this happens to you ,
But universally , these people that had been through this
You know , this country is involved as we &apos;ve all heard ,
I don &apos;t have an answer to that . Not everybody
can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here .
They were tough questions . There &apos;s polarized groups down there .
What do we need to do ? &quot; There &apos;s very polarized
I don &apos;t have the answer . But let me give you a simple
but there &apos;s nobody in this room that would rather have that
But you know what ? It wouldn &apos;t have made an old pigeon jealous .
I &apos;ve never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2 .
because of what it can do , and how it does it .
And we &apos;ll keep working . And I &apos;m not going to stop working
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about
who &apos;s paying for what and how much we get ,
giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining ,
Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts
It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road
Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable ,
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well :
to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in
Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields
But he felt all his old passion for her return .
&quot; Ford , &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
&quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot;
Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically
while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
As a magician , I try to create images that
to do things that doctors say are not possible .
I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin ,
The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice
for three days and three nights in New York City .
That one was way more difficult than I had expected .
The one after that , I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar
that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads .
In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days
It was , for me , one of the most difficult things I &apos;d ever done ,
There was so many skeptics , especially the press in London ,
My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing ,
I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges .
So , I began , early on , competing against the other kids ,
you know , five times , while I stayed under on one breath .
I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds .
I would later find out that was Houdini &apos;s personal record .
they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage .
And I think if something is done by one person
I started to think , if the boy could survive
there must be a way that I could do it .
And I asked him , how long is it possible
to go without breathing , like how long could I go without air ?
And he said to me that anything over six minutes
My first try , I figured that I could do something similar ,
and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water .
And I was shivering . In my first attempt to hold my breath
So , I realized that was completely not going to work .
So , I went to talk to a doctor friend ,
and I asked him how could I do that ?
&quot; I want to hold my breath for a really long time . How could it be done ? &quot;
create the illusion of not breathing , it will be much easier . &quot;
that he thought we could put inside of me ,
and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe
filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink
It &apos;s basically like trying to breathe , as a doctor said ,
would it be possible to hook up a heart / lung bypass machine
and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery ,
and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood ?
Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas :
To actually try to hold my breath past the point
You know , because they go down for four minutes on one breath .
And when I was researching pearl divers , I found the world
It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered , pretty much .
There is depth records , where people go as deep as they can .
That &apos;s holding your breath as long as you can
The first thing that I learned is when you &apos;re holding your breath
you should never move at all ; that wastes energy .
and it builds up CO2 in your blood . So , I learned never to move .
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down .
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax
You do that , you get lightheaded , you get tingling .
So , when you hold your breath it &apos;s infinitely easier .
Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath ,
and just hold and relax and never let any air out ,
and just hold and relax through all the pain .
I would wake up and the first thing that I would do
So , basically what that means is I would purge ,
And I would hold , immediately after , for five and half minutes .
then immediately after that I would hold again for five and half minutes .
I would repeat this process eight times in a row .
Out of 52 minutes you &apos;re only breathing for eight minutes .
At the end of that you &apos;re completely fried , your brain .
You feel like you &apos;re walking around in a daze .
Basically , I &apos;m not the best person to talk to when I &apos;m doing that stuff .
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .
The thinner I was , the longer I was able to hold my breath .
And by eating so well and training so hard ,
my resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute .
In four months of training I was able to hold my breath
I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations
to see if I could slow my heart rate down
I decided that I was going to break the world record
The world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds ,
held by Tom Sietas , that guy with the whale lungs I told you about .
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln center
and if I stayed there a week not eating ,
which I was sure would help me hold my breath
longer than I had been able to do it .
I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date .
And I thought everything seemed to be on track .
Two days before my big breath hold attempt , for the record ,
they had to pull my body out and bring me back .
So , naturally , the only way out of the slump
I told her that I wanted to up the ante
and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had .
This was a different record . This was a pure O2
Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train .
So , I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night .
Every morning , again , after getting out of that tent
My first attempt on pure O2 , I was able to go up to 15 minutes .
So , he pulled me up , and I was fine .
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed .
It was my ex-girlfriend . While I was breaking the record underwater
for the first time , she was sifting through my Blackberry ,
My brother had a picture of it . It is really ...
I then announced that I was going to go for
Then his main competitor went out and broke his record .
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared .
Now , I wanted to get the Science Times to document this .
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
So , I don &apos;t know if it was the magic or the lore of the Cayman islands ,
and did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding .
While he was there I tried to impress him , of course .
And I did a dive down to 160 feet ,
which is basically the height of a 16 story building ,
and as I was coming up , I blacked out underwater ,
I completely trained to get my breath hold time up
But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it ,
But in practice , I would do it face down , floating on the pool .
But for TV they wanted me to be upright
that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up .
So , I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose ,
which we never did before , is there was a heart-rate monitor .
So , every time my heart would beat I &apos;d hear the beep-beep-beep-beep ,
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute ,
I was just sitting there thinking , &quot; I &apos;ve got to slow this down .
And the heart rate just kept going up and up ,
Basically it &apos;s the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center .
When I made it to the halfway mark , at eight minutes ,
that I was not going to be able to make this .
There was no way for me to do it .
to doing this breath hold thing , if I had cracked early
it would be a whole show about how depressed I am .
at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that .
I kept pushing to 10 minutes . At 10 minutes
At minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears ,
and I started to feel my arm going numb .
And I &apos;m a hypochondriac , and I remember arm numb means heart attack .
Then at 13 minutes , maybe because of the hypochondria .
to 50 , to 150 , to 40 , to 20 , to 150 again .
It would start . It would stop . And I felt all this .
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack .
So , at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out
because I knew that if I did go out ,
if I did have a heart attack , they &apos;d have to
jump into the binding and take my feet out
before pulling me up . So , I was really nervous .
So , I let my feet out , and I started floating to the top .
But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop ,
They had doctors with the &quot; Pst , &quot; you know , so ,
And I think that there is some weird thing --
And then I realized that I had made it to 16 : 32 .
So , with the energy of everybody that was there
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds .
As though that wasn &apos;t enough , what I did immediately after
and had them take every blood sample that they could
to test for everything and to see where my levels were ,
I had the world record and I wanted to
So , I get to New York City the next day ,
and this kid walks up to me -- I &apos;m walking out of the Apple store --
this kid walks up to me he &apos;s like , &quot; Yo , D ! &quot;
He said , &quot; If you really held your breath that long ,
As a magician I try to show things to people
And I think magic , whether I &apos;m holding my breath
while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be .
And that &apos;s what magic is to me , so , thank you .
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question ,
then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion
of one of the critical issues of our time ,
and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities ,
with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day ,
I express my deep sympathy , and before that , September 11 --
of the one world that we are living in .
And that is that if we want to have one world ,
I will not deal with those first two , except to say
as to how to put together a legal economy .
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best .
that the state in the 21st century must perform ?
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this ;
we hope to share that much widely with --
and third is that we could actually construct an index
how well these functions that we would agree on
management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity .
I would argue that we know how to do this .
if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943 ?
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany
Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group --
The least important form of capital , in this project ,
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
Now , the issue that should concern us here --
that I would like to pose to this group --
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century .
What is it that we need to do fundamentally
You only want clean environments in which to function .
But if you don &apos;t think through the problems of corruption ,
As the work on paradigms , long time ago showed --
would be able to deal with the issue of state and development
and the empowerment of the majority of the world &apos;s poor ,
Ashraf Ghani : What scares me most is -- is you ,
You asked me . You know I always give the unconventional answer .
you know , when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years ,
travel between two cities that used to take three hours
So the first is when the scale is that ,
that just the simple things that are infrastructure --
to one of the most immense , brutal forms of exercise of power --
Then , tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism --
I mean , I really can &apos;t believe how lucky I am here ,
I thought that the chances of my living more than three years
You see , because , I mean -- I give you one statistic .
listen to at least three radio stations a day .
in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world ,
You know , when I went back in December of 2001,
I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government
And I told them -- my people , with the Americans here --
Yes , I have an advisory position with the U.N.
And everybody was telling me it was a different world .
as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people .
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is --
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future ,
where her children could really have a different life .
who are making their living off the drugs trade ?
and paying it to a couple of security companies ,
of the most critically innovative companies in the world
countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment ,
And we need to understand , it &apos;s the value chain .
but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want
They don &apos;t want to sell to the charity bazaars
Yeah , we have the best embroiderers in the world !
Why can &apos;t we do what was done with northern Italy ?
the critical issue really is to now think through .
And what I will say here is that aid doesn &apos;t work .
I &apos;m all for it ; after all , I raised a lot of it .
is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid ,
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents ;
You know , the aid system , at first , was designed to benefit
And this is , again , one of those assumptions --
you know I &apos;m very harsh on my counterparts --
you will not be able to sustain the consensus .
I &apos;m going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it ,
and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic .
And then I &apos;ll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an incurable optimist .
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before .
Now , you &apos;ve all seen &quot; Inconvenient Truth . &quot; This is a little more inconvenient .
Because , with our present knowledge , we have no idea what would happen .
Even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world &apos;s climate
Due to our release , through factories and automobiles every year ,
of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide --
which helps air absorb heat from the sun --
Well , it &apos;s been calculated a few degrees &apos; rise in the earth &apos;s temperature would
And if this happens , an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley .
Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami
For , in weather , we &apos;re not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety
than even the atomic physicist encounters , but with life itself .
Larry Brilliant : Should we feel good , or should we feel bad
Well , it depends , really , on what your goals are .
And I think , as my goals , I always go back to Gandhi &apos;s talisman .
&quot; How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one
or the wrong one ? &quot; he said , &quot; Consider the face of the poorest ,
most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon ,
and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person .
And if it will be , it &apos;s the right thing to do , and if not , rethink it . &quot;
For those of us in this room , it &apos;s not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual ,
it &apos;s the community , it &apos;s the culture , it &apos;s the world itself .
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society ,
the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism .
Let &apos;s review them both . First of all , the megatrends .
There &apos;s two degrees , or three degrees of climate change baked into the system .
It will cause rising seas . It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .
It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable ,
and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade , as he had forecast ,
And we consume so much that again , a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion
That &apos;s why in June of this year , we passed , as a species , 51 percent of us living in cities ,
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did .
And with desertification , sandstorms , the Gobi Desert , the Ogaden ,
to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago .
In Africa last year , Africans ate 600 million wild animals ,
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses
that have never been charted , the genomic sequences of which we don &apos;t know .
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of ,
but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne , emerging communicable diseases .
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth . But it has a dark side
-- in bioweapons , and in technology that puts us on a collision course
to magnify any anger , hatred or feeling of marginalization .
for which there are big winners and even bigger losers
-- today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history .
One percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services .
What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day
rise to three billion in the next 30 years ?
The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world &apos;s goods
but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer .
Last week , Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said ,
230 a day , that required police or military intervention .
We are facing an unprecedented number , scale of disasters .
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu
a quaint forerunner of things to come . It &apos;s a destabilized world .
And unlike destabilized world in the past , it will be broadcast to you on YouTube ,
you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones .
For some , it will lead to anger , religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .
For us , where does it take us , as social activists and entrepreneurs ?
As we look at these trends , do we become despondent , or will we become energized ?
Let &apos;s look at one case , the case of Bangladesh .
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines ,
the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today ,
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case
that we can hope for , and it could be 10 times that .
What will that do to Bangladesh ? Let &apos;s take a look .
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level .
Let &apos;s go up and take a look at the Himalayas .
And we &apos;ll watch as global warming makes them melt . More water comes down ,
the deforested areas , here in the Tarai , will be unable to absorb the effluent ,
because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water .
Now we &apos;re looking down south , through the Kali Gandaki .
Many of you , I think , have probably trekked here .
And we &apos;re going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh
and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water
coming from the north , and in the seas rising from the south .
Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh .
And now let &apos;s look from the south , looking up , and let &apos;s see this in relief .
A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas ,
coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas . And take a look at this .
As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate
But if you look at the globe , all around the earth , wherever there is low-lying area ,
you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life .
Sub-Saharan Africa , and even our own San Francisco Bay Area .
This is not something that happens far away to people that we don &apos;t know .
Global warming is something that happens to all of us , all at once .
names that you hadn &apos;t heard 20 years ago : ebola , lhasa fever , monkey pox .
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans ,
Do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of West Nile fever ?
And then we watched , as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola
until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it ?
that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years .
But now let &apos;s look at the case for optimism .
Enough of the bad news . Human beings have always risen to the challenge .
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves .
We &apos;ve been here before , paralyzed by fear , paralyzed into inaction ,
when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach
and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility ,
Medicins Sans Frontieres , that renewed our commitment to disaster relief ,
Mohamed ElBaradei , and the tremendous hope and optimism that he
brought all of us , and our own Muhammad Yunus .
We may see the eradication of polio this year .
Last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year --
there are only 35,000 cases left in the world .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
And we &apos;ve seen a new disease , not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases .
All throughout the technology world , we &apos;re seeing young people bitten by this
But they &apos;re using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did .
They &apos;re not waiting until they die to create foundations .
They &apos;re actively guiding their money , their resources , their hearts , their commitments ,
Certainly , nothing can give you more optimism than that .
in the &apos; 60s , and I am a creature of the &apos; 60s , there was a movement .
We all felt that we were part of it , that a better world was right around the corner ,
that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice .
Today , there &apos;s another kind of movement . It &apos;s a movement to save the earth .
Five weeks ago , a group of activists from the business community gathered together
to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants
Six months ago , a group of business activists gathered together to join with the
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness .
We &apos;re seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago
I would not have believed , as the evangelical community
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement .
something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon .
And on April 14th , there will be Step Up Day , where there will be a thousand
individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest
against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming .
And on July 7th , around the world , I learned only yesterday ,
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air .
Now , that doesn &apos;t mean that people understand that global warming
That means that people are beginning the first step ,
But I am seeing in the major funders , in CARE , Rockefeller ,
Rockefeller Brothers Fund , Hewlett , Mercy Corps , you guys , Google ,
so many other organizations , a beginning of understanding that we need
to work not just on primary prevention of global warming ,
but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming
But for me , I have another reason to be an incurable optimist .
And you &apos;ve heard so many inspiring stories here , and I heard so many last night
that I thought I would share a little bit of mine .
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery , and I studied with a very wise teacher ,
who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny --
it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO
at a time when there was no smallpox program .
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists
In the last century -- that &apos;s the one that was seven years ago --
more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world .
In the Summer of Love , in 1967 , two million people , children , died of smallpox .
When you read the biblical plague of boils , that was smallpox .
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox .
To eradicate smallpox , we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history .
We visited every house in India , searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses ,
In a cruel reversal , after we had almost conquered smallpox --
and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur , the realm of the final inch .
When we had almost eradicated smallpox , it came back again ,
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox ,
And when they did , they took smallpox to 10 other countries
But , in the end , we succeeded , and the last case of smallpox :
this little girl , Rahima Banu -- Barisal , in Bangladesh --
when she coughed or breathed , and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs
and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus ,
thus ended a chain of transmission of history &apos;s greatest horror .
A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India , and blinded half of
all of those who were made blind in India , ended .
And most importantly for us here in this room , a bond was created .
of every race , every religion , every color , worked together ,
fought against a common enemy , didn &apos;t fight against each other .
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
but not design as we usually think about it .
I want to talk about what is happening now
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities ,
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that
and then at the end talk a little bit
about what some of the implications are for us
and for our species , as well as our cultures ,
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
There isn &apos;t a dog on this earth that &apos;s a natural creature .
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days
We don &apos;t have to do it that way anymore .
created to try to get the hardiness of a camel
And they are now using these in certain cultures .
This is the largest cat in the world --
there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild .
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures .
And so one of the things we &apos;ve been doing
Well , they &apos;ve now taken that gene , that bioluminescent gene ,
Once they could do that with cells , they could do it with organisms .
And by the way , the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green
And if you can do it with monkeys --
though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate
they can probably figure out how to do it in apes ,
which means they can do it in human beings .
that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable
you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered
and they are actually available now in certain states .
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --
And so some states have decided to allow them ,
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision
on whether , pretty soon , you could be eating this fish --
the majority of food you buy in the supermarket
we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --
by the very same man that some of you may remember
because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo , which he had not .
to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do ,
because there are many horses that win important races
In other words , the equipment to put them out to stud
you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race
to create drugs and other things in their bodies
from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea ,
are pigs that they are going to use , in fact ,
and then that cow gave birth to a guar .
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .
And it raises the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species
is they &apos;ve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
This actually is one of DARPA &apos;s very important --
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs ,
and they can fly these creatures around the lab .
They can make them go left , right . They can make them take off .
They put them about one inch above the ground ,
and then they shut everything off and they go pfft .
But it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
And in fact , this technology has gotten so developed
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth ,
and they can just hook it up to their technology ,
it &apos;s got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres ;
it &apos;s got a camera on top of its head .
They have it running through mazes , controlling where it &apos;s going .
so that a computer watched their brains while they moved ,
especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm ,
Pretty soon , the computer learned , by reading the monkey &apos;s brainwaves ,
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm ,
And eventually she was moving it and moving it ,
could move the prosthetic arm in the other room

And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
For the first time in the history of this planet ,
Do we get to go someday to Pets &apos; R &apos; Us

And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color .
Well he didn &apos;t write anything about it in The Origin of Species .

And so today , I would like to present to you
Others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
If you try to weigh it -- of course it &apos;s very easy to weigh it ,
and when you eat it , the weight matters --
I &apos;ve been looking at these things for so long .
This is very rough , and this is sort of smooth , and this perfectly smooth .

Now , I get to the final thing , which is the set
In a way , it &apos;s the story of my life .
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician , and he told me ,
This is a construction of a man named &#91; Gaston &#93; Julia

like this wiggle wiggle , that &apos;s a new problem --
that one couldn &apos;t make any sense of the numbers .
And if you plot them , you must choose some system .

After all , happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few ,
what to do , what to buy , what to sell ,
And who gets to express it , and how do we express it ?
Well , one way to express choice is through the market .
The great Indian economist , Amartya Sen , was awarded the Nobel prize
for demonstrating that famine is not so much about
the availability of food supply , but rather the ability to acquire
or entitle oneself to that food through the market .
In 1984 , in what can only be considered one of the
greatest crimes of humanity , nearly one million people died of starvation
in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country --
but because in the north , people could not access
And most of Africa &apos;s farmers are , by and large ,
small farmers in terms of land that they operate , and very , very small
farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal .
African agriculture today is among , or is , the most under-capitalized in the world .
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated ,
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare ,
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa .
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America ,
and three times more tractors in Asia , than in Africa .
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice ,
He comes to the market when prices are lowest ,
with the meager fruits of his hard labor , just after the harvest ,
some months later , when prices are highest , in what we call
the lean season -- when food is scarce --
because she has to feed her family and has no choice .
The real question is , how can markets be developed in rural Africa
in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers
any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake
at the market and want to make money , just like everyone else .
And one thing is clear , which is at least now we know
Over two decades ago , the world insisted to Africa that markets
must be liberalized , that economies must be structurally adjusted .
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ?
probably , because we know that , in fact , Africa is the only region
in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up
stagnated , and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased .
and I &apos;ve spent some 15 years traveling around the continent
traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent , hundreds of traders --
trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform .
And it seems to me that the reforms might have
and the risks of transacting in rural , agriculture markets ,
Africa &apos;s markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure
in terms of roads and telecommunications , but also because
of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions , such as
Because of this , commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles ,
in narrow networks of people they know and trust .
And because of that , as grain changes hands --
and I &apos;ve measured that it changes hands four , five times in
its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer --
every time it changes hands -- and I &apos;ve seen this all over rural Africa --
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me
over and over -- that &apos;s the only way people know what they &apos;re getting
in terms of the quantity and the product quality .
for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals ,
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin
is simply due to the fact that , because of the absence
For their part , small farmers , who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa ,
come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind --
in the only market , the nearest local market they know --
where they &apos;re unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk .
Speaking of risk , we have seen that price volatility
of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world .
In Africa , small farmers bear the brunt of this risk .
In fact , in my view , there is no region of the world and no period in history
that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk
And in my view , there is simply no place in the world
that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk
In Ethiopia , for example , the variation in maize prices
from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually .
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling , and has direct implications
for not only the incentives of farmers to invest
in higher productivity technology , such as modern seeds and fertilizers ,
To give you an example , between 2001 and 2002,
Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest .
That in turn , because of the weak marketing system ,
led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country .
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields .
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain
was left in the fields to rot in early 2002 .
Not six months later , in July 2002 , Ethiopia announced a major food crisis ,
to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation .
is in the areas where there were good rains , and where farmers
to withdraw from the fertilizer market , not use fertilizer
and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent .
or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks .
Well , I &apos;m not here today to lament about the situation , or wring my hands .
I am here to tell you that change is in the air .
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions ,
which was mainly about getting governments out of the market .
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just
price incentives , but also investing in the right infrastructure
the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market .
that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa ,
Nearly three years ago , I decided to leave my comfortable job
and come back to my country of birth , Ethiopia ,
understanding , studying , and trying to convince policymakers and donors
I decided it was time to do something about it .
I currently lead , in Ethiopia , an exciting new initiative
to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange , or ECX .
In fact , in 1848 , 82 grain merchants and farmers got together
in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan
to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves .
That was , of course , the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade ,
which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world .
that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange .
In the American Midwest , farmers used to load grain onto barges
But once it arrived , if no buyer was to be found ,
or if prices suddenly dropped , farmers would incur tremendous losses .
And in fact , would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan ,
rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms .
Well , the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses
led to the birth of the futures market , and the underlying system
of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts
on the basis of which trade could be done .
From there , the greatest innovation of all came about in this market ,
which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain
without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain .
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances ,
and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future .
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture ,
and the rise of Chicago to a global market ,
agricultural market , superpower from where it was , a small regional town .
we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview
and that the reference prices for cotton , coffee , cocoa --
are actually a reference price , or a price discovered in these
a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets .
And over the last decade , you see that the share of Western exchanges --
and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world --
has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade .
Similarly , there &apos;s been explosive growth in India , for example ,
where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here
over the last three years by 270 percent a year .
aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market .
2004 , overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become
Now , in Ethiopia , we &apos;re in the process of designing
We &apos;re not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model
or the India model , but creating a system uniquely tailored
So , the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia .
We &apos;re creating a system that serves all market actors ,
and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described .
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia ,
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem
And this is because one of the things we &apos;ve learned
over the last decade of studying market development in Africa
You &apos;ve got one donor trying to develop market information ,
another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards ,
another ICT , and yet another on warehousing , or warehouse receipts .
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system ,
because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electronic trading .
But at the same time , we &apos;ll do something which I think no exchange
in the world has ever done , which is itself to operate something like
can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call
without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up
or any of those things , simply see the trading
At the same time , what &apos;s very fundamental to this market is that --
and again , an innovation that we &apos;ve designed for our exchange --
is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country ,
in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done .
And in turn , we &apos;ll operate an in-house clearing system ,
in the right amount and at the right time ,
so that basically , we create trust and integrity in the system .
we &apos;re also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework ,
the overarching legal framework for making this market work .
What &apos;s really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system
to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country ,
using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination
Whereas before the farmer used to think local --
meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market ,
without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was --
now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .
And they start to think national , and even global .
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions ,
but also planting decisions , on the basis of information
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products
It will also transform the way traders do business .
It will stop them from doing simple , back-to-back , limited arbitrage
to really thinking strategically about how to move grain
across long distances from &#91; surplus regions &#93; to &#91; deficit areas &#93; .
We believe that this initiative requires great political will ,
and we &apos;ll have to align the financial sector , as well as the ICT sector ,
We believe that the winds of change are here , and that we can do it .
The last parliament of our century opened with our president
announcing to the country that this was the most important
ECX , moreover , can become a trading platform for a pan-African market
Ethiopia &apos;s domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .
And we feel that over the next five years ,
if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent , just 40 percent , of the domestic market ,
and add just 25 percent value to that market , the value of the market doubles .
and , in fact , Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa .
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition
So , we are in the business of finding our happiness .
About the size of the Great Wall of China ,
And yet it &apos;s made from parts that are invisible , or near-invisible , to the naked eye :
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone .
And as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free .
But , moving mountains can be dangerous . Let me try and explain why .
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth &apos;s land surfaces .
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel .
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification .
It was here in the late &apos; 60s and early &apos; 70s
and about 70 percent of the world &apos;s agricultural drylands .
And it is largely an issue that we &apos;ve created for ourselves
to try and find out how far away it is .
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year .
That &apos;s the Sahara eating up almost &#91; two meters &#93; a day of the arable land ,
Here I am -- I &apos;m the second person on the left --
So , they moved the entire village , hut by hut .
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune ,
which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .
If you happen to live close to the desert border ,
you can pretty much calculate how long it will be
and abandon your home and your life as you know it .
Now , sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts .
And still , those extreme environments are very good places
came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara .
called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted
from Mauritania in the west , all the way to Djibouti in the east .
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving ,
what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains
And a good way of doing that , the most efficient way ,
But , one of the problems with planting trees is that
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees
This sandstone wall that I &apos;m proposing essentially does three things .
to the texture of the dune &apos;s surface , binding the grains .
It provides a physical support structure for the trees ,
they can help support the trees , protect them from humans ,
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid ,
or we can have the wind excavate it for us .
So , the wind carries the sand onto the site
and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us .
how am I planning to solidify a sand dune ?
How do we glue those grains of sand together ?
And the answer is , perhaps , that you use these guys ,
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process .
What happens is , you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand ,
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains .
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong .
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes .
Here I am , playing the part of the mad scientist ,
but I did , quite literally , a back of the envelope calculation --
-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete
we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars .
And , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria ,
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure ,
fill it with bacteria , then allow the sand to wash over the balloon ,
pop the balloon , as it were , disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it .
The second alternative would be to use injection piles .
So , we pushed the piles down through the dune ,
We then pull the piles up through the dune
and we &apos;re able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand
with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .
So , we have a way of turning sand into sandstone ,
and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes .
Well , I was inspired , for my architectural form , by tafoni ,
which look a little bit like this , this is a model representation of it .
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto .
And I realized that if I scaled them up , they would provide me
for ventilation , for thermal comfort , and for other things .
Now , part of the formal control over this structure
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually .
I think there is really something in that articulation
We see the result , the traces , if you like ,
of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert
and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way .
It &apos;s a natural process . It goes on in nature today ,
and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them .
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land
And quite frankly , we &apos;re putting our heads in the sand .
If nothing else , I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion .
But , if I had something like a TED wish ,
this very , very long , but very narrow city in the desert ,
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure ,
and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges .
but we must build as if the sand were stone . &quot;
Now , there are many details left to explore in this scheme --
My design , as it takes you down the rabbit hole ,
I was born in Poland , now in the U.S.
that we think it takes for modern life to exist --
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle .
that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that I needed
made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime ,
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines .
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
because it is hardware that can change people &apos;s lives
If we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing ,
then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential .
From what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning .
of what we all can do to make a better world
and joined some colleagues there , and asked them a question :
And then he had to clarify that he wasn &apos;t talking about them .
You see , this was only a few years after
And even though that turned out to be nothing ,
that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve ,
we should have some evidence of their existence by now .
And yet , to the best of our knowledge , we are alone .
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic
However , with respect , I might point out two possibilities
that in the midst of the World War , out of nowhere ,
and darken the history of the human species forever after ?
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien ,
wouldn &apos;t he be the first to have tried to convince
that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia ;

This was the summer when the special edition of
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore .
And so I spent the rest of the vacation
largely sitting outside our little rental house at night ,
but their necks soon got sore , and they would go off to the boardwalk
I was pretty good at the video games . I was not very good at the other part ,
I would say they were in their late seventies ,
and I would say that they were on a date ,
because he was wearing a very neat little suit
And she was wearing a cardigan , because it was now fully night
and a chill was coming in off the ocean .
And then they stopped , and the man turned to me
You have to admit , that &apos;s a pretty boss piece of detective work
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll
&quot; There &apos;s no such thing as space men , &quot; she said .
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean .
I did not know why they were teasing me .
And what would be behind those rubber masks , if they were ?
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun ,
Now , you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --
and a girl talked to me . Now , on its face --
this is impossible on its face , I realize --
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal , who sat on my left .
She had long , curly black hair , a blue jean jacket .
I remember , she had some sort of injury to her ankle ,
I was starting high school at the time . I would say she was a junior ,
but I had never seen her before . She didn &apos;t go to my school .
I didn &apos;t know her name , and I never will .
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother ,
They were both big fans , mother and daughter --
because I had not read the novel &quot; Dune &quot; at that time .
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question :
apropos of nothing , like she didn &apos;t even care about the answer ,
as though she just wanted to talk to me .
I did not know what to say . I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch &apos;s version of &quot; Dune , &quot;
There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator ,
that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist
that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio
to the outside world , and could never touch them .
I mean , I liked him a lot better than the sandworms .
to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible .
it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again .
When I say it out loud , it sounds so ridiculous ,
that it was what , in the alien abductee community ,
to cover up some trauma -- say , of being kidnapped
I did not slow down to talk to her .
I sure am glad I never saw her again .
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community
that he could not remember the previous ten minutes ,
or the previous ten hours , or the previous ten days .
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book ,
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie .
And the way I remember it , the movie featured these details .
Two : the alien was played by a rubber puppet .

they made a movie out of the book , &quot; Communion , &quot;
Something odd ? Something off ? Something wrong with this picture ?
And to this day , I have no answer for you .
and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde
What ? Did we do this ? Really ? Does anyone do this ?
which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world .
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock ,
and the lead dog bit me on the ass ,
requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic
and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach
and to get to the beach , she explained , you would have to take
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten , and so I said , &quot; No . &quot;
I remember what she looked like before she left .
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue , as a result .
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country ,
to go to a beach she did not know
It took me some time to come to my senses .
it was very late in the day , almost dinnertime ,
Nervous , I went down to the street to look for her .
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,
and the aliens had not given us that technology yet .
or she would never come back to the hotel .
I did not watch the skies , but the very end of the street
hoping that they would part and I would see her face .
in that very small town of 30,000 or so ,
that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe
Five young men -- all laughing , happy , traveling together ,
coming back to this hotel where they were staying .
One of them was named Joseph , and he asked me
And he said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot; He was sure that Catherine would be safe .
And for the next two hours , they all waited with me :
taking turns , going up to their room , coming back ,
And then , in the middle of a sentence , at the very birth of twilight ,
She was smiling . She did not understand why I was so worried .
although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter
as they clapped us on the back , and went back up to their room
and left us alone in the street , holding hands .
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory ,
And even now , a decade and a half later ,
I look for her still , whenever she is not in the room .
And even though , I think you &apos;ll agree , it is probable
she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone ,
about how coral reefs work , how they ought to be ,
after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica
And so I &apos;m going to sort of go through
two , or some historians would say three world wars
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe .
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s :
because you can go to a Costco in the United States
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from ,
and one way that I think is really interesting
because people like to go out and catch fish .
go to a place off of Key West in Florida ,
throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water ,
come back with the biggest and the best fish ,
are put on this board , where people take a picture ,
but this is what it was like in the 1950s
that you couldn &apos;t put any of those small fish up on it .
and if you wanted to go out and kill something ,
to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .
What that was , was a forest of sponges and coral ,
and we hear a lot about plastic these days .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember the movie
but this is the plant of &quot; The Little Shop of Horrors . &quot;
But , instead of devouring the people in the shop ,
but , as it stands , it &apos;s the monster from hell ,
all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer , we use too much of it .
It &apos;s subsidized , which is one of the reasons we used too much of it .
and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton ,
And when it dies , it falls to the bottom
you see on the right , where there used to be prawns .
That picture on the left is just staggering to me .
In the upper right of that picture on the left
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows ,
and little droplets of the water get into the air ,
the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood
and I was trying to figure out how to
&quot; So , imagine you &apos;re in a movie called &apos; Escape from Malibu&apos;
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France .
the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died
The other kinds of effects of climate change --
this is coral bleaching . It &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
The corals say , &quot; You cheated . You didn &apos;t pay your rent . &quot;
Not all of them die ; some of them survive ,
To try and give you a sense of this ,
and you wake up the next morning , and you look around you ,
and you see that 80 percent of the trees ,
have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked .
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later ,
&quot; Oh , by the way , a quarter of those died . &quot;
the overfishing , the pollution and the climate change --
is that each thing doesn &apos;t happen in a vacuum .
But there are these , what we call , positive feedbacks ,
for people like me in thinking about all this ,
I mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
So what are the oceans going to be like
Then you sure won &apos;t want to eat fish that were raised in it ,
water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen ,
It &apos;s not about the fish ; it &apos;s not about the pollution ;
So the question is : Will we respond to this or not ?
I want to talk to you today about prosperity ,
And hope actually is at the heart of this .
almost literally in terms of money and economic growth .
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades
We can &apos;t live with it ; we can &apos;t live without it .
it &apos;s a tough choice ; it isn &apos;t much of a choice .
And our best avenue of escape from this actually
And I think we are a clever species sometimes .
But I think we should also just check the numbers ,
and we &apos;ll give them that two percent hike in income , in salary each year as well ,
how far and how fast would be have to move ?
How much technology would we need in this world
on the left-hand side is where we are now .
we have to be right over here at the right-hand side
Maybe we can do it , maybe it &apos;s possible -- who knows ?
and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere ,
which is what we &apos;re going to need to be doing
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .
It &apos;s a bit complex , and I apologize for that .
What I &apos;ll try and do , is I &apos;ll try and paraphrase it
Firms produce goods for households -- that &apos;s us --
and that &apos;s even better , because we can spend those incomes
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system ,
It does this in a couple of ways --
which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff .
It &apos;s a process of the production and reproduction of novelty ,
that we use to tell each other stories --
that is locking economic structure with social logic --
the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together
in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt ,
the HDTV , two holidays a year in the sun ,
the netbook and iPad , the list goes on --
because , if we don &apos;t buy them , the system crashes .
And of course , that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis .
But this -- I just want to show you some data here .
this credit and debt system , just for the U.K.
This was the last 15 years before the crash ,
and you can see there , consumer debt rose dramatically .
It was above the GDP for three years in a row
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
This is people expanding debt , drawing down their savings ,
maybe we should just go back and say , &quot; Did we get this right ?
we actually run up against a couple of anomalies .
In the crisis , in the recession , what do people want to do ?
They want to hunker down , they want to look to the future .
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do
just so that we can get the show back on the road ,
it &apos;s a place where the system actually is at odds
that we don &apos;t do the blindingly obvious things we should do
putting in efficient lights , turning the lights off occasionally ,
So is it that , though they make perfect economic sense ,
Well , I had my own personal insight into this
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping ,
was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .
when she turned to me very solemnly and said ,
These ones , interestingly , are 400 miles north of here
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather .
putting the kids on the bus in the morning ,
escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening
getting from one end of the day to the other ,
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view ,
we &apos;re looking at a map of the human heart .
And in the same token , the solution becomes clear ,
that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years
and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States ,
And I just want to , very quickly , show you this .
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
we can just put in a little search term .
There you go , Oxford , that &apos;s where we are . See what comes up .
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession ,
and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues
what we need the economy to do , in fact ,
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing
But it &apos;s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
An investment -- investment , after all , is just such a basic economic concept --
So let me come back , with this sense of hope ,
on less than the price of a skinny latte
And it &apos;s also clear that we will never achieve that
a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations ,
Chris Anderson : While they &apos;re taking the podium away , just a quick question .
First of all , economists aren &apos;t supposed to be inspiring ,
so you may need to work on the tone a little .
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
We &apos;re actually all happier , and a country &apos;s more beautiful ,
Tim Jackson : Well that &apos;s clearly not what you &apos;re doing .
You &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
You &apos;re making news out of the things that tell you that we &apos;re flourishing .
Actually , I already am seeing a little bit of it .
politicians would stand up , treasury spokesmen would stand up ,
and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves .
through which we &apos;ve been working over the last 18 years --
and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics --
CA : But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together ,
or is it going to be more just civil society and companies ?
TJ : It has to be companies . It has to be civil society .
for civil society and businesses to operate differently --
that we actually can make the -- what was it ? --
would you then actually like that picture of economic growth
TJ : I would still want to know that you could do that
and get below zero by the end of the century ,
in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere ,
and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water .
If you can convince me we can do all that ,
CA : Tim , thank you for a very important talk . Thank you .
So I &apos;m going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills
and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted .
I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil .
And what you see here is , you see a little bit of crude oil ,
oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer .
we use 25 percent of the world &apos;s oil production .
And you don &apos;t really understand that until you see this stuff burn .
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday ,
because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil .
Then there &apos;s all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon .
You &apos;ve probably heard of benzene rings ; they &apos;re very carcinogenic .
to these big , thick , galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons ,
and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur
and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them .
Those are called the asphaltenes ; they &apos;re an ingredient in asphalt .
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
If it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill .
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .
and some of the toxic things float into the water column
and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp .
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing --
of oily , messy goo that you have in the water ,
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain ,
there were big , floating cushions the size of sofa cushions
with the consistency , or the viscosity , of chewing gum .
And every single oil is different when it hits water .
will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves .
when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .
So I &apos;m going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics ,
why this summer is so important , why we need to stay focused .
No , they think , &quot; Ugh . I have to go buy gas .
I &apos;m so angry about it . The oil companies are ripping me off .
They set the prices , and I don &apos;t even know .
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump --
You might notice that many gas pumps , including this one ,
I &apos;ve talked to engineers . That &apos;s specifically to diffuse our anger ,
that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy ,
not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market .
is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume ,
it &apos;s much more important to have a car that runs ,
to have a job and keep a job , than to have a GED .
Now there &apos;s another perverse thing about the way we buy gas ,
which is that we &apos;d rather be doing anything else .
It is green . It is a shrine to greenishness .
Well , the reason is , is because , when we &apos;re buying gas ,
we &apos;re very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance .
I mean , we &apos;re angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else .
And we get kind of in on our own con .
But in fact , that &apos;s why the slogan &quot; beyond petroleum &quot; worked .
But it &apos;s an inherent part of our energy policy ,
We talk about energy independence . We talk about hydrogen cars .
We talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil ,
and it &apos;s really important to dealing with this oil spill .
The oil industry is like a huge , gigantic octopus
but we actually see it in very moral terms .
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see , we had these gushers .
They weren &apos;t farmers , they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground .
But in the beginning , this was seen as a very morally problematic thing ,
And then , of course , there was John D. Rockefeller .
It was terrifying ; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now ,
imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s .
that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .
she said , &quot; He has a thin nose like a thorn .
Okay , so that guy is actually still with us .
I mean , this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA .
So , you might be wondering why it is that ,
every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill ,
and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
And this is something that we &apos;ve been doing since 1974,
when we first asked them , &quot; Why are there these obscene profits ? &quot;
And we &apos;ve sort of personalized the whole oil industry
rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
And so I &apos;m not saying these guys aren &apos;t liable to answer questions --
whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards ,
of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate ,
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a distraction .
and it &apos;s powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week .
I mean , these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill .
it formed the environmental movement in its modern form .
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act ,
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
I think it &apos;s important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds
we &apos;re standing at the gas pump , and we &apos;re feeling kind of helpless .
and we understand , for the first time , our role in this supply chain .
as voters , we have kind of a &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment .
This is why these moments of these oil spills
But it &apos;s also really important that we don &apos;t get distracted
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills
was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .
We were very reactive , as opposed to being proactive
we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling .
but we didn &apos;t actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed .
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume
As you can see , our own production has fallen off
as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out .
We only have two percent of the world &apos;s oil reserves ;
65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf .
One of the things that &apos;s happened because of this
the country of Nigeria , or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil ,
which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland --
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill
And we can wrap our heads around the spills ,
but in fact , these guys actually live in a war zone .
And these guys , I mean , if they were in the U.S. ,
They have degrees in political science , degrees in business --
they &apos;re entrepreneurs . They don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
And it &apos;s sort of one of the other groups of people
is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs .
One of the places we put in a big oil project
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem .
and I was just like , &quot; Ahhh ! This is it . &quot;
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out ,
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields .
and we are not paying for that price at the pump .
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th .
we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year .
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there
that we do not pay for at the pump .
and we can &apos;t even calculate the cost of this involvement .
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil
Now what &apos;s happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see ,
but it should , I mean , it &apos;s a bird sanctuary .
Also , every time you buy gasoline in the United States ,
half of it is actually being refined along the coast ,
and a lot of our marine terminals as well .
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us
And finally , American families also pay a price for oil .
Now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high
when you consider the actual cost of the oil ,
the fact that people have no other transit options
means that they pay a large amount of their income
If you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids ,
They &apos;re actually spending more on their car and fuel
than they are on taxes or on health care .
and it &apos;s kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher .
So , what I &apos;m going to talk to you about now is :
What are the laws ? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ?
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater .
The moratoriums are fine , but we do need to focus
One of the things that we also need to do ,
is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves
into thinking that you can have a green world ,
before you reduce the amount of oil that we use .
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic
of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy .
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray ,
which is called the rejected energy -- the waste ,
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs
And one of the things that we need to do
is , not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles
but we also need to fix the economy in general .
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year
pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000 .
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies .
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry ,
which is at least 10 billion dollars a year ,
into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute .
for new cars and new fuels down the road ,
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing ,
and the idea is instead of being helpless , we need to be more strong .
and to really sort of thinking about who we are ,
where we connect the dots actually at the pump .
are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone .
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil
but I think that if we started this year
and upped it to six cents next year , nine cents the following year ,
all the way up to 30 cents by 2020,
that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption ,
and at the same time we would give people time to prepare ,
and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time .
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work .
This is a gas receipt , hypothetically , for a year from now .
The first thing that you have on the tax is --
you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents .
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign ,
And what it says is , &quot; The National Academy of Sciences
estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car
And so this -- you can see that you &apos;re paying considerably less
you start to be connected to the whole greater system .
And at the same time , you have a number that you can call
or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car ,
one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember
We need to keep or minds on the molecules
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work
of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .
yes , I know it all began with &quot; Britain &apos;s Got Talent . &quot;
is to show you -- I hope I &apos;ll be able to show you
but by being integrated into the language in those places .
We are going to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot; We are late .
Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
And you don &apos;t necessarily have to have your own TV set .
that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway ,
Now , of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance , but not entirely .
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists .
One of them , Lima Sahar , is a Pashtun from Kandahar ,
And here she relates , in the documentary film &quot; Afghan Star , &quot;
how her friends urged her not to do this
and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
I have to say , her husband backed her from the start .
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .
it sets a very important example for young women --
these are young women in the audience of the program --
in Abu Dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience .
it actually , in the Gulf , is precipitating a revival
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully ,
Many of them are too young to run for president ,
Last year when I was here , I was speaking to you about a swim
And while that swim took place three years ago ,
I can remember it as if it was yesterday .
I remember standing on the edge of the ice ,
how long will it take for my frozen body
And then I said to myself , I &apos;ve just got to get this thought
is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up ,
there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind --
and then walking up to the edge of the ice
and my fingers were literally the size of sausages
because -- you know , we &apos;re made partially of water --
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years
The glacier &apos;s gone all the way up the mountain
so one in three people on this earth --
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is ,
and with the water supply from these glaciers --
I think we have a real risk of instability .
North , you &apos;ve got China ; south , you &apos;ve India , Pakistan , Bangladesh ,
Now , I don &apos;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt . Everest ,
carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain --
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level .
It &apos;s very , very difficult to breath . You get altitude sickness .
I feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided
to do a big cleanup operation on Mt . Everest .
and this was the year they decided to go
which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish --
there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters --
And all the way along the glacier we saw
And then we got up to this small lake
for this swim which was going to be so very difficult .
I put on my iPod , I listened to some music ,
and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .
I then -- I don &apos;t know how it happened -- but I went underwater .
and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake
and get up and then take another gasp of air .
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on .
I carried on for another five or six strokes ,
and I went down to the bottom of the lake .
is the most peaceful death that you can have .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
and then we walked as quickly as we could
and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong
And my team just gave it to me straight .
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days &apos; time ,
and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth --
and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this .
that just because something has worked in the past so well ,
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work in the future .
And taking that into the world of climate change --
just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long ,
just because we have consumed the way we have for so long
and populated the earth the way we have for so long ,
can you take in your relationship to the environment ,
And I ask you , please , to go away from here
and then commit a hundred percent to doing it .
Blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it ,
if we really put our whole minds to it .
I usually say to people , when they say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do .
And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some
And now I &apos;ve had a little bit of time to think about it ,
and we &apos;ve seen all these problems in the last few days ,
most of the big issues -- clean water , clean energy --
they all look to me to be hardware problems .
And that &apos;s in fact probably what I &apos;m going to try and tell you about .
So , this talk is going to be about how do we make things
and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
Now , TED sends you a lot of spam if you &apos;re a speaker
about &quot; do this , do that &quot; and you fill out all these forms ,
and you don &apos;t actually know how they &apos;re going to describe you ,
and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist .
And I &apos;ve always been nervous about the term &quot; futurist , &quot;
because you seem doomed to failure because you can &apos;t really predict it .
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have ,
and said , &quot; You know , well , if I have to talk about the future , what is it ? &quot;
And George Homsey , a great guy , said , &quot; Oh , the future is amazing .
We &apos;re going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut ,
and we &apos;re going to make your poo smell like peppermint . &quot;
So , you may think that &apos;s sort of really crazy ,
but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening
So , this isn &apos;t my work , but it &apos;s work of good friends of mine at MIT .
This is called the registry of standard biological parts .
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight
Basically , what they &apos;re doing is looking at biology as a programmable system .
that you can string together to execute a program .
Now , this is actually becoming such an interesting idea .
This is a state diagram . That &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
So that &apos;s essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches .
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich
And from the results of the same competition last year ,
a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria
so that they can detect light and switch on and off .
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now
because we used to live in a world where everyone &apos;s said glibly ,
&quot; Form follows function , &quot; but I think I &apos;ve sort of grown up in a world
I was in a lab associated with his -- where it &apos;s really a world
but to show you the power of art over science --
this is actually one of the cartoons I write . These are called &quot; HowToons . &quot;
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta .
and about that many pages to describe what I was doing ,
and it took him one page . And so this is our muse Tucker .
He &apos;s an interesting little kid -- and his sister , Celine --
is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl .
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things ,
you should be able to do something pretty interesting
In this case , he &apos;s done self-replication of a complex 3D structure .
And that &apos;s what I thought about for a long time ,
that &apos;s just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff , sort of layered up .
The feature side is -- you know , people will say ,
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers ,
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally
if we knew how to build things this way .
into the way it makes things . So this little thing here , polymerase ,
in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials ,
on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system .
In a neutral state , they won &apos;t bind at all .
Now , if I make a string of these , a bit string ,
That encodes ; that will now copy . From one comes two ,
And so you &apos;ve got this sort of replicating system .
He did a lot of this work in the &apos; 60s ,
and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow
as we went down the digital computer revolution , but it &apos;s now coming back .
So now I &apos;m going to show you the hands-free , autonomous self-replication .
So we &apos;ve tracked in the video the input string ,
We set them off on this air hockey table .
You know , high science uses air hockey tables --
-- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy ,
but what you &apos;re actually seeing is copies of that original string
emerging from the parts bin that you have here .
So , why would you want to replicate bit strings ?
Well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme ,
that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy ,
and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure .
So I was trying to , you know , take the engineer &apos;s version :
Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials
So what I &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape --
the B -- assemble from a string of components
And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here ,
and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design ,
was that you don &apos;t need digital logic to do computation .
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips .
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process .
So , Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday , I believe ,
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles .
and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out .
Now , hopefully , those of you who know anything about graph theory
can look at that , and that will satisfy you
and in fact , you know , I can now take a dog , carve it up
and then reassemble it so it &apos;s a linear string
I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits .
when you start looking at the world a little bit differently .
And so I &apos;m thinking about , you know , what are the programs
And how do we think about materials and structure ,
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point ,
but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently .
You set a couple of boundary conditions , like gravity ,
the surface tension , density , etc . , and then you press &quot; execute , &quot;
and magically , the universe produces you a perfect ball lens .
of -- so there &apos;s a half a billion to a billion people in the world
that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site ?
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .
If it &apos;s elliptical , you can make an astigmatic lens .
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure --
so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure --
from minus 12 to plus eight diopters , up to four diopters of cylinder .
And then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
I &apos;ve seen this video , but I still don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to end right .
So you reverse this . This is a very old movie ,
so with the new prototypes , actually both surfaces are flexible ,
Now you &apos;ve finished the lens , you literally pop it out .
That &apos;s next year &apos;s Yves Klein , you know , eyeglasses shape .
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters .
And as I rotate it against this side shot , you &apos;ll see that that has cylinder ,
So , this sort of thinking about structure as computation
and structure as information leads to other things , like this .
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs
are working on at the moment , called &quot; electronic rope . &quot;
So literally , you think about a rope . It has very complex structure in the weave .
Under a different load , it &apos;s a different structure . And you can actually exploit that
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope
Just by thinking about the physics of the world ,
I guess I &apos;m just going to casually tell you the types of things
One thing I &apos;m really interested about this right now is , how ,
if you &apos;re really taking this view of the universe as a computer ,
how do we make things in a very general sense ,
and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense
And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits
share the information and work on those things together .
So , a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time ,
So that means anything you do , or anything you make ,
and I think Lego in the &apos; 70s nailed this ,
But they can show you how to build things in sequence .
so you end up with this sort of guy , right ?
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts .
&quot; How do I get everyone to collaborate on design
she talks about how you get students at MIT
And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink
how we define structure and materials and assembly things ,
on how you do those things in a more profound way
and build on each other &apos;s source code for structure .
I don &apos;t know exactly how to do this yet ,
but , you know , it &apos;s something being actively thought about .
like , is this a compiler ? Is this a sub-routine ?
Maybe I &apos;m getting a little too abstract , but you know ,
this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters --
this is sort of the universe , or a different universe view ,
that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future --
from biotech to materials assembly . It was great to hear Bill Joy .
but these are the new things in materials science .
How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas ,
and see the world in a different way ? And it &apos;s not going to be binary code
I &apos;ve gone too far . So that sounds like it &apos;s it .
I &apos;ve probably got a couple of minutes of questions ,
or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff
in the introduction , so I may have to explain that .
So maybe I &apos;ll do that with this short video .
which also happens to be a minimal energy surface .
This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp .
So that &apos;s a kite the size of your house .
And so you want that to tow boats very fast .
So I &apos;ve been working on this a little , also ,
But , you know , this is another way to look at the --
this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe .
You could just hang it as a bed sheet ,
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed
with systems like that . So that &apos;s sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
that we need to do more than we are .
that those of us who live in the developed world
need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions .
That &apos;s , to put it mildly , not what &apos;s on the table now .
when we look at what is there in reality today
and the magnitude of the problem that we face .
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us ,
And I think this is what we &apos;ve done with climate change .
We look at where the emissions are coming from --
they &apos;re coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth ,
that they &apos;re coming out of fossil fuels that we &apos;re burning ,
to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy .
And while , of course , we do need clean energy ,
we &apos;re going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people
living in cities or within a day &apos;s travel of one .
that those of us in the global North live in today ,
So if we &apos;re seriously talking about tackling climate change
we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
The solution , in fact , may be closer to hand than we think ,
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing --
I choose to turn this light switch on --
by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in .
but if I can just focus on this one for a moment ,
it really tells us a lot of what we need to know --
is that denser places tend to have lower emissions --
which isn &apos;t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
We go out there and we hop in our cars
And we &apos;re basically using mobility to get the access we need .
is that the things we need are close by .
is the one that you never had to make in the first place ,
to increase the density of the communities around us .
Some places are doing this with new eco districts ,
which is nice work if you can get it ,
but most of the time , what we &apos;re talking about is , in fact ,
that we don &apos;t even need to densify an entire city .
where we don &apos;t drive as much and so on .
by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot .
So you can think of it as tent poles
that actually raise the density of the entire city .
we can , in fact , have a few places that are really hyper-dense
Now we may find that there are places that are really , really dense
what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions
if they &apos;re surrounded by places that make them feel at home ,
We have the manufacture of the car , the disposal of the car ,
all of the parking and freeways and so on .
When you can get rid of all of those
you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions
All around the world , we &apos;re seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life .
People are saying that it &apos;s moving from the idea of the dream home
with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we &apos;re starting to see ,
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me , in this case ,
how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes
Some of it is about walking . It &apos;s not all perfect yet .
and we &apos;re starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation .
of course , we &apos;re also learning how to put information on dumb objects .
Things that don &apos;t have any wiring in them at all ,
My favorite example is a drill . Who here owns a drill , a home power drill ?
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes
And so what we do is we buy these drills
that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time ,
use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit .
is that , in fact , turning those products into services
that we have access to when we want them ,
And in fact , even space itself is turning into a service .
We &apos;re finding that people can share the same spaces ,
that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on --
and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on .
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine .
energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent .
if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be heated with a furnace ,
you save a whole bunch of money up front .
to slash our product use , slash our transportation use ,
all of that is great , but it still leaves something behind .
And if we &apos;re going to really , truly become sustainable cities ,
This is Vancouver &apos;s propaganda about how green a city they are .
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart
this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery .
We have visions like this . We have visions like this .
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us
that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities ?
that we have from food and fiber and so forth ,
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible ,
&quot; by stealing the future , selling it in the present
living on a planet where their cities also steal the future ,
we &apos;re going to run out of future really fast .
I think that , in fact , we can have cities
have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century
and have given us a new understanding of who we are ,
where we &apos;ve come from and the times we live in .
of Stalin , Hitler , Mao , Pol Pot , Rwanda and other genocides ,
and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old ,
we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur
This has led to a common understanding of our situation ,
namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence , and perhaps
that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from , to our peril .
from an op-ed on Thanksgiving , in the Boston Globe
a couple of years ago , where the writer wrote , &quot; The Indian life
was a difficult one , but there were no employment problems ,
crime nearly non-existent , what warfare there was between tribes
or wholesale slaughter . &quot; Now , you &apos;re all familiar with this treacle .
We teach it to our children . We hear it on television
and in storybooks . Now , the original title of this session
was , &quot; Everything You Know Is Wrong , &quot; and I &apos;m going to present evidence
that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong ,
that , in fact , our ancestors were far more violent than we are ,
that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time ,
and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species &apos; existence .
a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory
and obscene . But I &apos;m going to try to convince you
that that is the correct picture . The decline of violence
is a fractal phenomenon . You can see it over millennia ,
although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset
of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century . One sees it
It &apos;s especially evident in the West , beginning with England
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --
from the millennium scale to the year scale --
to try to persuade you of this . Until 10,000 years ago , all humans
or government . And this is the state that &apos;s commonly thought
to be one of primordial harmony . But the archaeologist
of evidence about this way of life , has shown a rather different conclusion .
showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare
in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies .
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die
at the hands of another man , as opposed to passing away
of natural causes , in a variety of foraging societies
in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest .
And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die
at the hands of another man to , in the case of the Gebusi ,
only a 15 percent chance . The tiny , little blue bar in the lower
left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States
and Europe in the twentieth century , and includes all the deaths
of both World Wars . If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed
during the 20th century , there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million .
at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described
in the Bible . And in this supposed source of our moral values ,
one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare ,
such as the following from Numbers 31 : &quot; And they warred
and they slew all the males . And Moses said unto them ,
&apos;Have you saved all the women alive ? Now , therefore , kill every male
among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man
by lying with him , but all the women children that have not know a man
by lying with him keep alive for yourselves . &apos; &quot; In other words ,
kill the men ; kill the children ; if you see any virgins ,
then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them .
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk .
Also in the Bible , one sees that the death penalty
was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality ,
adultery , blasphemy , idolatry , talking back to your parents --
down one order of magnitude , and look at the century scale .
we know just from conventional history -- the evidence
was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction
For example , any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture
were routine forms of criminal punishment . The kind of infraction
today that would give you a fine , in those days would result in
your tongue being cut out , your ears being cut off , you being blinded ,
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment :
burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel ,
The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes :
criticizing the king , stealing a loaf of bread . Slavery , of course ,
a popular form of entertainment . Perhaps the most vivid example
was the practice of cat burning , in which a cat was hoisted
on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire ,
and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat , howling in pain ,
What about one-on-one murder ? Well , there , there are good statistics ,
for homicide rates in any village , hamlet , town , county
He plotted on a logarithmic scale , going from 100 deaths
per 100,000 people per year , which was approximately the rate
of homicide in the Middle Ages . And the figure plummets down
to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year
in seven or eight European countries . Then , there is a slight uptick
in the 1960s . The people who said that rock &apos; n &apos; roll would lead
to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that .
But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude
in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present ,
and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century .
that keep such statistics , since 1945 , in Europe and the Americas ,
there has been a steep decline in interstate wars ,
in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms , and in military coups ,
even in South America . Worldwide , there &apos;s been a steep decline
in deaths in interstate wars . The yellow bars here show the number
of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present .
And , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths
per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths
per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
Even in the year scale , one can see a decline of violence .
Since the end of the Cold War , there have been fewer civil wars ,
fewer genocides -- indeed , a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --
and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime .
This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics . You can see
that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the &apos; 50s and the &apos; 60s ,
then it soared upward for several decades , and began
a precipitous decline , starting in the 1990s , so that it went back
to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960 .
So the question is , why are so many people so wrong
about something so important ? I think there are a number of reasons .
One of them is we have better reporting . The Associated Press
is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth
There &apos;s a cognitive illusion . We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is
the higher the probability that you assign to it .
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage
burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying
in their beds of old age . There are dynamics in the opinion
and advocacy markets : no one ever attracted observers , advocates
things just seem to be getting better and better .
in modern intellectual life , and an unwillingness to acknowledge
And of course , our change in standards can outpace the change
in behavior . One of the reasons violence went down
is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time .
but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day ,
things always look more barbaric than they would have been
by historic standards . So today , we get exercised -- and rightly so --
if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection
in Texas after a 15-year appeal process . We don &apos;t consider
that a couple of hundred years ago , they may have been burned
at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial
that lasted 10 minutes , and indeed , that that would have been repeated
over and over again . Today , we look at capital punishment
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink ,
Well , why has violence declined ? No one really knows ,
but I have read four explanations , all of which , I think ,
have some grain of plausibility . The first is , maybe
Thomas Hobbes got it right . He was the one who said
that life in a state of nature was &quot; solitary , poor , nasty , brutish
but because of the logic of anarchy . In a state of anarchy ,
there &apos;s a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively ,
gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling
in the basement . Being a good American , he has a pistol
in the nightstand , pulls out his gun , and walks down the stairs .
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand .
&quot; I don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
Maybe I had better shoot him , before he shoots me ,
especially since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to kill me ,
he &apos;s probably worrying right now that I might kill him
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought ,
and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first .
Now , one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence .
You don &apos;t strike first , but you have a publicly announced policy
that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded .
liable to having its bluff called , and therefore can only work
if it &apos;s credible . To make it credible , you must avenge all insults
and settle all scores , which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta .
Life becomes an episode of &quot; The Sopranos . &quot; Hobbes &apos; solution ,
the &quot; Leviathan , &quot; was that if authority for the legitimate use
of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --
then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack ,
leaving its profitability as zero . That would remove the temptation
to invade preemptively , out of fear of them attacking you first .
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation
to make your deterrent threat credible . And therefore , it would lead
to a state of peace . Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates
that you failed to see in the earlier slide --
argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe
So that &apos;s a bit of a support for the leviathan theory .
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence
in zones of anarchy , in failed states , collapsed empires ,
The second explanation is that in many times and places ,
there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap .
In earlier times , when suffering and early death were common
in one &apos;s own life , one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them
on others . And as technology and economic efficiency make life
longer and more pleasant , one puts a higher value on life in general .
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne .
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game ,
and was worked out in the book &quot; Nonzero &quot; by the journalist
Robert Wright . Wright points out that in certain circumstances ,
in an interaction , such as gains in trade when two parties trade
their surpluses and both come out ahead , or when two parties
lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend
that results in them not having to fight the whole time .
of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in ,
by allowing the trade of goods , services and ideas
over longer distances and among larger groups of people .
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead ,
and violence declines for selfish reasons . As Wright put it ,
&quot; Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb
The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book
called &quot; The Expanding Circle , &quot; by the philosopher Peter Singer ,
who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense
of empathy , an ability to treat other peoples &apos; interests
we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family .
and can be exploited with impunity . But , over history ,
the circle has expanded . One can see , in historical record ,
it expanding from the village , to the clan , to the tribe ,
to the nation , to other races , to both sexes ,
and , in Singer &apos;s own arguments , something that we should extend
if this has happened , what has powered that expansion ?
And there are a number of possibilities , such as increasing circles
of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for .
The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact
with other people , the more you realize that it is untenable
at least not if you want them to listen to you . You can &apos;t say
anymore than you can say that the particular spot
that I &apos;m standing on is a unique part of the universe
because I happen to be standing on it that very minute .
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism , by histories ,
and journalism , and memoirs , and realistic fiction , and travel ,
and literacy , which allows you to project yourself into the lives
of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human ,
and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station
in life , the sense that &quot; there but for fortune go I. &quot;
Whatever its causes , the decline of violence , I think ,
has profound implications . It should force us to ask not just , why
is there war ? But also , why is there peace ? Not just ,
what are we doing wrong ? But also , what have we been doing right ?
and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
Chris Anderson : I loved that talk . I think a lot of people here in the room would say
that that expansion of -- that you were talking about ,
that Peter Singer talks about , is also driven by , just by technology ,
by greater visibility of the other , and the sense that the world
is therefore getting smaller . I mean , is that also a grain of truth ?
Steven Pinker : Very much . It would fit both in Wright &apos;s theory ,
that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation
over larger and larger circles . But also , I think it helps us
imagine what it &apos;s like to be someone else . I think when you read
these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages , you think ,
how could they have not have empathized with the person
as far as they &apos;re concerned , this is just an alien being
that does not have feelings akin to their own . Anything , I think ,
with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration
CA : Well , Steve , I would love every news media owner to hear that talk
at some point in the next year . I think it &apos;s really important . Thank you so much .
If not , one or the other needs upgrading , isn &apos;t it ?
When I talk to my students about global issues ,
and I listen to them in the coffee break ,
And when they come back into the lecture room
I ask them , &quot; What do you mean with &quot; we &quot; and &quot; them &quot; ?
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s very easy . It &apos;s the western world and it &apos;s the developing world , &quot; they say .
But then you know , I press them like this .
So one girl said , very cleverly , &quot; It &apos;s very easy .
Western world is a long life in a small family .
Developing world is a short life in a large family . &quot;
And I like that definition , because it enabled me
So , you can see that what we have on this axis here
is size of family . One , two , three , four , five
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world .
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family ,
and take care of their kids , and how long they will live .
It &apos;s about the bathroom and the kitchen . If you have soap , water and food , you know ,
And the students were right . It wasn &apos;t that the world consisted --
the world consisted here , of one set of countries over here ,
which had large families and short life . Developing world .
And we had one set of countries up there
the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime .
And all the developing world started to apply family planning .
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family ,
But some countries remain back in this area here .
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here .
And we , in fact , when we have played this over the world .
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week ,
of Mexico there , and China , in relation to United States .
It &apos;s on par with United States in these two social dimensions .
of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this .
has the problem that arms are coming from North ,
across the borders , so they had to stop that ,
because they have this strange relationship to the United States , you know .
because this is a free utility on the net .
And I can let the other countries be shown .
And now I have income per person on this axis .
And United States only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years ,
And what has happened in the world , I will show now .
You can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing .
You can see how the brown bubbles , which is west Europe ,
and the yellow one , which is the United States ,
That &apos;s why we are so scared about flu , isn &apos;t it ?
Did you note there , that we have Mexico up there ?
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States ,
because I have my oldest son now working for Google ,
Because in fact , this is child labor . My son and his wife sat in a closet
And my youngest son , who studied Chinese in Beijing .
So they come in with the two perspectives I have , you know ?
And my son , youngest son who studied in Beijing ,
Whereas when my oldest son , who works for Google ,
Or Google is quite generous , so he can have one or two years to go .
and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward .
and then he died , and then Deng Xiaoping started
Isn &apos;t it strange to see that the United States
first grew the economy , and then gradually got rich ?
it &apos;s not strange that all these countries grow so fast now .
Because what you see here , what you see here
and this is where I suggest to my students ,
is like having two chapters in the history of the United States .
The last chapter is about present , and president Obama ,
that is what we find in the developing world .
and that would be put together into a developing world ,
which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way ,
So , how could we make better sense about this ?
Well , one way of trying is to see whether we could
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world ,
from $ 1 . This is where you have food to eat .
This is $ 10 , whether you have a public or a private
provide health service for your family and school for your children ,
This is East Asia , and the light blue there is South Asia .
Can you see how it &apos;s growing ? And how hundreds of millions
and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia ?
but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there , you know , because --
that &apos;s where the projections are not valid any longer .
But more or less , this is what will happen ,
and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided .
which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ;
Yeah , this is a fact that from where the money comes ,
they have been saving , you know , over the last decade .
And here we have the countries in collapse and war ,
That &apos;s why it &apos;s so problematic to describe what has happened
a slightly different approach of what you would call it .
I heard that your departments here were by regions .
that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom .
But when I split it , when I split it
the size of the bubbles here is the population .
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius , completely different .
And I can split the others . Here is the South Asian ,
And here were are . We have a continuum in the world .
It is Mayflower down here . It is Washington here ,
At this point I decided to make a pause .
And it is my task , on behalf of the rest of the world ,
Many are not aware of -- no , this is not a joke .
that we have a grasp of what &apos;s happening in the world .
on the internet , for the world to use . Thank you very much .
tax money , and then they sell it to add a little profit ,
But the people doing that at the World Bank
It &apos;s just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies
to deal with the world in the modern way , as we do .
And when it comes to free data and transparency ,
United States of America is one of the best .
And that doesn &apos;t come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor .
I would like to show you what happens with the data ,
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this .
are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .
We have a continuum . But we still have , of course ,
Congo , up there . We still have as poor countries
And that &apos;s the bottom billion , where we &apos;ve heard today
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it ,
because it &apos;s the only child mortality that we can measure .
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year .
They started very well . They used the aid well .
with an amazing 4.7 percent per year . They beat Sweden .
Here we go . Once again the USA is part of the reason here .
They get safe water , they get food for the poor ,
5.5 percent . They are faster than the millennium development goal .
Okay . I give you Singapore , the year I was born .
And here we go . It took a little time for them to get independent .
And they made the social investment . They got away malaria .
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden !
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals .
These yellow are just about to be doing this .
These red are the countries that doesn &apos;t do it , and the policy has to be improved .
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world .
This is dollar per person . This is HIV in the countries .
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected .
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
And in spite of them having quite a high income ,
But you also see that there are African countries down here .
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa .
There &apos;s a number , five to 10 countries in Africa
that has the same level as Sweden and United States .
And I will show you that what has happened
in one of the best countries , with the most vibrant economy
They have a very high level . It &apos;s coming down .
it &apos;s working with treatment . And people are not dying .
And it &apos;s not the economy . Richer country has a little higher .
Look at the provinces of Kenya . They are very different .
Don &apos;t make it Africa . Don &apos;t make it a race issue .
Make it a local issue . And do prevention at each place ,
in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
This is the disease , Konzo , I spent 20 years
It &apos;s caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation .
It &apos;s similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the &apos; 30s .
This is the epidemic in Mozambique . This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania .
Don &apos;t get confused of the progress of the emerging economies
We need a new mindset . The world is converging ,
but -- but -- but not the bottom billion .
They are still as poor as they &apos;ve ever been .
It &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one superpower .
and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
And we have a high hope in you . Thank you very much .
In October , I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo ,
but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
In the past 10 years , five million people have died
I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms ,
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
because only three percent of people in the DRC
who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms ,
said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost ,
and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them ,
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .
And it turns out that there are three main messages
They name the condoms things like Vive , &quot; to live &quot;
put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them ,
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places ,
that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out
people that aren &apos;t even in the country they &apos;re working &#91; in &#93; .
you just have to think about who is your customer ,
that are going to get them to change their behavior .
to convince you that history has a direction , an arrow ;
Now , when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk --
-- that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting .
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe .
It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election ,
And to be honest , if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk
that even as I was giving the upbeat talk ,
-- I might have said , &quot; Is it okay if I talk about something else ? &quot;
But I didn &apos;t , OK . So we &apos;re here . I &apos;ll do what I can . I &apos;ll do what I can .
the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle ,
The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring --
I mean , there &apos;s always been a kind of a certain grim dimension
to the way I try to uplift , so if grim inspiration --
-- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms , that is , I &apos;m afraid ,
the most you can hope for . OK , today -- that &apos;s if I succeed .
the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial .
a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels .
Because what happened in the beginning , this stuff encases itself in a cell ,
Eventually they get so close , they form multicellular organisms ,
then you get complex multicellular organisms ; they form societies .
But then at some point , one of these multicellular organisms
does something completely amazing with this stuff , which is
it launches a whole second kind of evolution : cultural evolution .
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .
A lot of you have heard the term &quot; memes . &quot; The evolution of technology ,
I pay a lot of attention to , so , you know ,
one of the first things you got was a little hand axe .
Generations go by , somebody says , hey , why don &apos;t we put it on a stick ?
but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years ,
Impressive . And the rate of technological evolution speeds up ,
so a mere quarter of a century after this , you get this , OK .
I &apos;m sorry -- it was a cheap laugh , but I wanted to find a way
to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse ,
So , what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse
Now , first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are ,
to be on the brink of true global social organization .
Originally , you had the most complex societies , the hunter-gatherer village .
which is what you get with the invention of agriculture : multi-village polity
With the invention of writing , you start getting cities . This is blurry . I kind of like that
because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you
how many levels organic organization has already moved through
to get to this point . And then you get to , you know , you get empires .
I want to stress , you know , social organization can transcend political bounds .
This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire .
So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent ,
even if no polity did similarly . Today , you &apos;ve got nation states .
Point is : there &apos;s obviously collaboration and organization going on
This is actually just a picture of the earth at night ,
and I &apos;m just putting it up because I think it &apos;s pretty .
Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system .
Now , I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something
Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading , very quickly ,
the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games , in which correlations
Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive , OK .
it always adds up to zero-zero-sum . But if you &apos;re playing doubles ,
the person on your side of the net , they &apos;re in the same boat as you ,
It &apos;s either for the better or for the worse , OK .
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on
but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology arise
that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games ,
to harness this productive potential , so you get cities , you know ,
and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don &apos;t think about
Like , have you ever thought when you buy a car ,
how many people on how many different continents contributed
to the manufacture of that car ? Those are people in effect
I mean , there are certainly plenty of them around .
Now , this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way ,
because when you think of non-zero , you think win-win , you know ,
First of all , it can accommodate ; it doesn &apos;t deny the existence
that it &apos;s not intrinsically upbeat , because a non-zero-sum game ,
all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse .
So , in a way , the question is : on what grounds
am I upbeat at all about history ? And the answer is ,
first of all , on balance I would say people have played their games
to more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes . On balance ,
I think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department .
And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me ,
which is that there is a moral dimension to history ;
there is a moral arrow . We have seen moral progress over time .
and treated them that way . And then this moral revolution arrived ,
and they decided that actually , no , Greeks are human beings .
But this was progress -- you know , give them credit . And now today ,
we &apos;ve seen more progress . I think -- I hope -- most people here would say
unless they do something horrendous , regardless of race or religion .
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been ,
few thousand years ago , and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic .
I think that &apos;s the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities ,
ethnicities , religions as there is today . If you asked me ,
you know , why am I not in favor of bombing Japan ,
well , I &apos;m only half-joking when I say they built my car .
and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize
that someone else &apos;s welfare is positively correlated with yours --
I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality .
Unfortunately , I don &apos;t fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough
to know , or any other kind of business class really ,
but I assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know ,
because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class
are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money
off all these people . And I really do think that , in that sense at least ,
that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm
which is not only economic by any means -- it &apos;s not always commerce --
but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth ,
which is the fundamental equality of everyone . It has done that .
As it has moved global , moved us toward a global level of social organization ,
but what about this so-called clash of civilizations ? Well , first of all ,
I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework ,
between the so-called Muslim world and Western world --
two terms I don &apos;t like , but can &apos;t really avoid ;
in such a short span of time , they &apos;re efficient if nothing else --
if people in the Muslim world get more hateful , more resentful ,
it &apos;ll be bad for the West . If they get more happy , it &apos;ll be good for the West .
And I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time
because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
It &apos;s the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible .
And one reason is because of something I call the &quot; growing lethality of hatred . &quot;
More and more , it &apos;s possible for grassroots hatred abroad
to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil .
And that &apos;s pretty new , and I think it &apos;s probably going to get a lot worse
trends in information technology , in technologies that can be used
And there &apos;s something I worry about especially , which is that
this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope .
What I have in mind is : terrorism happens here ; we overreact to it .
That , you know , we &apos;re not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation
We overreact because being human , we feel like retaliating ,
You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes ,
we really shouldn &apos;t have the word positive there at all , even in a technical sense .
So let &apos;s call it the death spiral of negativity .
I assure you if it happens , at the end , both the West
So , what do we do ? Well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control ,
because I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be enough anyway , although it &apos;s essential .
I think we &apos;re going to have to have a major round
I think you &apos;re just going to have to see less hatred among groups ,
less bigotry , and , you know , racial groups , religious groups , whatever .
I &apos;ve got to admit I feel silly saying that .
It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish . I feel like Rodney King , you know ,
But hey , I don &apos;t really see any alternative , given the way I read the situation .
There &apos;s going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world ,
In my defense , I &apos;d say , as naive as this may sound ,
-- thank you , thank you . That is to say , remember : my whole view
of morality is that it boils down to self-interest .
It &apos;s when your welfare conduces to mine , that I decide , oh yeah ,
I &apos;m all in favor of your welfare . That &apos;s what &apos;s responsible
for this growth of this moral progress so far ,
and I &apos;m saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes ,
and if people respond to it intelligently , we will see
We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality .
So , these two things , you know , if they get people &apos;s attention
and drive home the positive correlation and people do what &apos;s in their self-interests ,
And that &apos;s why I lump growing lethality of hatred
and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric ,
Now , launching a moral revolution has got to be hard , right ?
And I think the answer is a lot of different people
are going to have to do a lot of different things .
We all start where we are . Speaking as an American
who has children whose security 10 , 20 , 30 years down the road
I worry about -- what I personally want to start out doing
is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us , OK .
I also like it because it &apos;s an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise .
in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do
the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment ,
because you &apos;ve got to relate their experience to yours .
To really understand it , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Oh , I get it .
So when they feel resentful , it &apos;s kind of like
and for somewhat the same reasons . &quot; That &apos;s true understanding .
And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that .
It &apos;s especially hard to do when people hate you , OK ,
I mean , you want to hear the reason , but you don &apos;t want to be able to relate to it .
You don &apos;t want to say , &quot; Well , yeah , I can kind of understand
would hate the country I live in . &quot; That &apos;s not a pleasant thing ,
but I think it &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to have to get used to and
work on . Now , I want to stress that to understand , you know --
there are people who don &apos;t like this whole business of understanding
the grassroots , the root causes of things ; they don &apos;t want to know
why people hate us . I want to understand it .
The reason you &apos;re trying to understand why they hate us ,
is to get them to quit hating us . The idea
when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate
their humanity and better understand them , is part of an effort
to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run .
I think it &apos;s the first step toward that . That &apos;s the long-term goal .
There are people who worry about this , and in fact ,
a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I &apos;d written .
It was kind of along these lines , and the allegation was
Now , the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter .
I mean , if you &apos;ve got to have an enemy , do make it Ann Coulter .
But it &apos;s not a crazy concern , OK , because understanding behavior
and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love , and so on .
But I think we &apos;re a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending
the situation clearly enough , than in comprehending it so clearly
that we just can &apos;t , you know , get the army out to kill terrorists .
So I &apos;m not really worried about it . So --
-- I mean , we &apos;re going to have to work on a lot of fronts ,
but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again ,
will have forced us to a higher moral level .
If you look at the word &quot; salvation &quot; in the Bible --
saving souls , that people go to heaven -- that &apos;s actually a latecomer .
The original meaning of the word &quot; salvation &quot; in the Bible is about saving the social system .
&quot; Yahweh is our Savior &quot; means &quot; He has saved the nation of Israel , &quot;
which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
Now , social organization has reached the global level , and I guess ,
if there &apos;s good news I can say I &apos;m bringing you , it &apos;s just that
all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit
It &apos;s going to be hard . I say we give it a shot anyway
because we &apos;ve just come too far to screw it up now .
I am very , very happy to be amidst some of the most --
I am very happy and honored to be amidst
Every single thing I planned to say , they have said it here ,
and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say .
that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something ,
So , I will -- since I am not young and am very old ,
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment ,
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa &apos;s problems
Unfortunately , I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan .
One , because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated .
and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP .
to the tune of 13 , 15 percent of its GDP ,
and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect .
How the media covers Africa in the West , and the consequences of that .
the media is telling the truth about Africa , and nothing but the truth .
However , the media is not telling us the whole truth .
although they &apos;re part and parcel of our African reality ,
which means that the media are covering only six countries .
that the Western media largely presents to its audience .
But the effect of that presentation is , it appeals to sympathy .
It appeals to pity . It appeals to something called charity .
What should we do with it ? We should give food to the hungry .
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill .
to serve those who are facing a civil war .
And in the process , Africa has been stripped of self-initiative .
I want to say that it is important to recognize
But equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa ,
We frame it as a challenge of hope , and that is worth creation .
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction ,
Medicines for the poor , food relief for those who are hungry ,
and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war .
And in the process , none of these things really are productive
because you are treating the symptoms , not the causes
ladies and gentlemen , does not create wealth for them .
Wealth is a function of income , and income comes from you finding
Now , once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa ,
They are entrepreneurs . &#91; Unclear &#93; told us they are always
about four percent of the population , but 16 percent are imitators .
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .
We need to put money where it can productively grow .
Support private investment in Africa , both domestic and foreign .
because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation .
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today ?
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health ,
Ladies and gentlemen , can any one of you tell me
a neighbor , a friend , a relative that you know ,
Does any one of you in the audience have that person ?
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of
Andrew Mwenda : I can see Bono says he knows the country .
AM : Thank you very much . But let me tell you this .
External actors can only present to you an opportunity .
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
and policy framework that can make it possible for us
to benefit from our external relations . I &apos;ll give you an example .
African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
to export goods , duty-free , to the European Union market .
My own country , Uganda , has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba .
have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market .
None of those countries , including Africa &apos;s most successful nation , Botswana ,
So , I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa &apos;s
is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework .
the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth ,
How do we begin to do that , and why is aid the bad instrument ?
Aid is the bad instrument , and do you know why ?
Because all governments across the world need money to survive .
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order .
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order .
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial ,
they need really to have the army clobber the opposition .
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on .
with the exception of a few , like that of Idi Amin ,
can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
To get legitimacy , governments often need to deliver things like primary education ,
depends on it having to raise money from its own people ,
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
so that it can collect more tax revenues from them .
is that it has distorted the structure of incentives
The productive margin in our governments &apos; search for revenue
to talk to the IMF and the World Bank .
I can tell you , even if you have ten Ph.Ds. ,
you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry .
Why ? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand
it requires that you listen to the people , the private sector actors in that industry .
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity ,
and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF
and the World Bank , and then it is the IMF and the World Bank
In the process , we , the African people , have been sidelined
We have limited input , because he who pays the piper calls the tune .
The IMF , the World Bank , and the cartel of good intentions in the world
and therefore what our governments are doing , because they depend on aid ,
is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens .
But I want to put a caveat on my argument ,
and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive .
Some aid may have built a hospital , fed a hungry village .
It may have built a road , and that road
generalize them , pour billions and trillions of dollars into them ,
ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village ,
that allowed that small aid project to succeed --
like in Sauri village , in Kenya , where Jeffrey Sachs is working --
and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
you can have , as a person in Africa seeking a career .
as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
in order to get access to the foreign aid pie .
Ladies and gentlemen , the most enterprising people in Africa
cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business .
Because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
So , the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government ,
and that has increased the political tensions in our countries
I also want to say that it is important for us to
note that , over the last 50 years , Africa has been receiving increasing aid
in the form of technical assistance , and financial aid ,
Between 1960 and 2003 , our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid ,
and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa .
I want to use the example of my own country , called Uganda ,
and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there .
In the 2006-2007 budget , expected revenue : 2.5 trillion shillings .
Uganda &apos;s recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean ?
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
It &apos;s because there &apos;s somebody there called foreign aid , who contributes for it .
But this shows you that the government of Uganda
Public administration , which is largely patronage , takes 690 billion .
Agriculture , which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens ,
And let me show you , what does public expenditure --
There you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers ,
by the way , who never see the president , except on television .
And when they see him physically , it is at public functions like this ,
and even there , it is him who advises them .
Each local government is organized like the central government --
There were 56 , and when our president wanted to
he had to create 25 new districts , and now there are 81 .
all of which have directors and the cars . And the final thing ,
this is addressed to Mr. Bono . In his work , he may help us on this .
Uganda has 961 sub-counties , each of them with a dispensary ,
and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects ,
Finally , I want to say that before I came to speak here ,
is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt .
When I was president of the American Psychological Association ,
summarizes what I &apos;m going to be talking about today ,
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them ,
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said , &quot; Professor Seligman ,
would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?
We &apos;d like to interview you about that . &quot; And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
And she said , &quot; But this is CNN , so you only get a sound bite . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Well , how many words do I get ? &quot;
We &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
&quot; Well , how many words do I get this time ? &quot; &quot; I think , well , you get two .
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
we can see you &apos;re really not comfortable in this medium .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good enough . &quot; And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
I want to say why psychology was good , why it was not good
and how it may become , in the next 10 years , good enough .
And by parallel summary , I want to say the same thing about technology ,
about entertainment and design , because I think the issues are very similar .
Well , for more than 60 years , psychology worked within the disease model .
Ten years ago , when I was on an airplane
and I introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what I did ,
psychology is about finding what &apos;s wrong with you . Spot the loony .
And now , when I tell people what I do , they move toward me .
is that , 60 years ago , none of the disorders were treatable --
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed ,
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression , alcoholism --
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
We could look across time at the same people --
people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia --
and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are ,
And best of all , we were able , in the last 50 years ,
And then we were able to test them rigorously ,
throw out the things that didn &apos;t work , keep the things that actively did .
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years ,
can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
And I think that &apos;s terrific . I &apos;m proud of it .
But what was not good , the consequences of that were three things .
that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble , bricks fell on you .
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions .
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier ,
more fulfilled , more productive . And &quot; genius , &quot; &quot; high-talent , &quot; became a dirty word .
And the third problem about the disease model is ,
in our rush to do something about people in trouble ,
in our rush to do something about repairing damage ,
And so , that &apos;s what led people like Nancy Etcoff , Dan Gilbert ,
Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology ,
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .
It should be interested in the best things in life .
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling ,
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future ,
we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology ,
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .
and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness .
You can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning ,
for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities :
a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio ,
what builds them and what gets in their way .
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states ,
and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness .
I &apos;ve spent my life working on extremely miserable people ,
how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you ?
And starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people .
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?
They &apos;re not more religious , they &apos;re not in better shape ,
they don &apos;t have more money , they &apos;re not better looking ,
they don &apos;t have more good events and fewer bad events .
The one way in which they differ : they &apos;re extremely social .
But watch out here . This is merely correlational data , not causal ,
and it &apos;s about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I &apos;m going to talk about :
And I &apos;m going to suggest to you that &apos;s not nearly enough , in just a moment .
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries ,
And we find that we &apos;ve been able to manualize many of them ,
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?
In a couple of minutes , I &apos;ll tell you about some of those results .
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have ,
in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill ,
and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable ,
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much --
we &apos;ve had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy .
and I call them different because different interventions build them ,
it &apos;s possible to have one rather than the other --
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can ,
a life in your work , your parenting , your love , your leisure , time stops for you .
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives
The first life is the pleasant life and it &apos;s simply , as best we can find it ,
it &apos;s having as many of the pleasures as you can ,
and learning the skills -- savoring , mindfulness -- that amplify them ,
and it &apos;s why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn &apos;t end here .
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life ,
about 50 percent heritable , and , in fact , not very modifiable .
So the different tricks that Matthieu &#91; Ricard &#93; and I and others know
about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life
are 15 to 20 percent tricks , getting more of it .
Second is that positive emotion habituates . It habituates rapidly , indeed .
It &apos;s all like French vanilla ice cream , the first taste is a 100 percent ;
by the time you &apos;re down to the sixth taste , it &apos;s gone .
And I have to tell you about my friend , Len ,
to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion ,
In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30,
Len was enormously successful . The first arena was work .
By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
By the time he was 25 , he was a multimillionaire
Second , in play -- he &apos;s a national champion bridge player .
But in the third great arena of life , love , Len is an abysmal failure .
And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish .
American women said to Len , when he dated them ,
&quot; You &apos;re no fun . You don &apos;t have positive emotion . Get lost . &quot;
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst ,
who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma
that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island
and he played football and watched football , and played bridge --
Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .
The question is , is Len unhappy ? And I want to say not .
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent
I think Len is one of the happiest people I know .
and that &apos;s because Len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow .
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning ,
time stops for him . And it stops till the closing bell .
until 10 days later , the tournament is over , time stops for Len .
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about ,
about flow . And it &apos;s distinct from pleasure in a very important way .
Pleasure has raw feels : you know it &apos;s happening . It &apos;s thought and feeling .
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow , you can &apos;t feel anything .
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life .
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can .
Just one example . One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi &apos;s .
so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her
But what she did was to take her highest strengths ,
and re-craft work to use them as much as possible .
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
You don &apos;t giggle a lot . What you get is more absorption .
So , that &apos;s the second path . The first path , positive emotion .
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
And meaning , in this view , consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia --
it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are , and using them
to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life ,
the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question ,
And the answer seems to be yes . And I &apos;ll just give you some samples of it .
It &apos;s being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works .
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect ,
one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills , the savoring skills ,
Next Saturday , set a day aside , design yourself a beautiful day ,
and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures .
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced .
Gratitude visit . I want you all to do this with me now , if you would .
I &apos;d like you to remember someone who did something enormously important
I hope all of you have such a person .
is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person ,
ask if you can visit , don &apos;t tell them why , show up at their door ,
you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens .
And what happens is when we test people one week later , a month later ,
three months later , they &apos;re both happier and less depressed .
Another example is a strength date , in which we get couples
to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test ,
and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths ,
and we find this is a strengthener of relationships .
But it &apos;s so heartening to be in a group like this ,
in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy .
Well , my undergraduates and the people I work with haven &apos;t discovered this ,
And what you find is when you do something fun ,
When you do something philanthropic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts .
So , the next to last thing I want to say is
we &apos;re interested in how much life satisfaction people have .
And this is really what you &apos;re about . And that &apos;s our target variable .
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives ,
So we ask -- and we &apos;ve done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people --
and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction ?
And our results surprised us , but they were backward of what we thought .
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction .
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement
and you have meaning , then pleasure &apos;s the whipped cream and the cherry .
Which is to say , the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts , if you &apos;ve got all three .
the empty life , the sum is less than the parts .
how long you live and productivity , follow the same relationship ?
is productivity a function of positive emotion , engagement and meaning ?
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes .
So , Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard ,
and so this was amazing for me . I &apos;ve never been in a gathering like this .
I &apos;ve never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much ,
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel
to the problems of technology , entertainment and design in the following way .
have been and can be used for destructive purposes .
And by the way , the distinction between relieving misery
I thought , when I first became a therapist 30 years ago ,
that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed ,
not anxious , not angry , that I &apos;d make them happy .
And I never found that . I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero .
And it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life ,
That is , it is possible for these three drivers of our world
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do --
not just positive emotion , that &apos;s not nearly enough --
there &apos;s flow in life , and there &apos;s meaning in life .
can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well .
is that I think with technology , entertainment and design ,
And if technology can , in the next decade or two , increase the pleasant life ,
the good life and the meaningful life , it will be good enough .
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion ,
what we &apos;re all doing together will become good enough . Thank you .
Let &apos;s just start by looking at some great photographs .
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out
and I shudder to think what they &apos;re going to do to this photograph .
This is a jet landing at San Francisco , by Bruce Dale .
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy , by Sam Abell .
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic , by Paul Nicklen .
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa ,
Shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels .
This is a rancher in Texas , by William Albert Allard ,
This is a soap disco in Spain , photographed by David Alan Harvey .
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance ,
And this is a comet , captured by Dr. Euan Mason .
And finally , the bow of the Titanic , without movie stars ,
under the relentless swirl of today &apos;s saturated , media world ,
Four years ago , I was at the beach with my son ,
in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches .
But I turned away for a moment , and he got caught into a riptide
and started to be pulled out towards the jetty .
as I go tearing into the water after him ,
the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement .
is when all the elements came together to define
not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer .
I was talking to Kyle last week about this ,
And he said , &quot; Oh , yeah , I remember that too !
was that you were up on the shore yelling at me . &quot;
some remarkable images taken by some of the world &apos;s greatest photojournalists ,
working at the very top of their craft --
and it was submitted and published in National Geographic .
Last year , we added a section to our website called &quot; Your Shot , &quot;
that every one of us has at least one or two
you have to have more than just one or two
You &apos;ve got to be able to make them all the time .
you need to know how to create a visual narrative .
You need to know how to tell a story .
So I &apos;m going to share with you some coverages
that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography .
and bring back a classic story of diverse species ,
And that is what Nick did , up to a point .
and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph .
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants .
It &apos;s one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa .
something that digital photography has made a big difference for .
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted .
The herd was safe within the confines of the park ,
the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park .
For outside the safety of the park were poachers ,
who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks .
after weeks of moving back and forth , in and out of the park ,
Annie had been killed , along with 20 members of her herd .
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory ,
And instead , created a story that touched our audiences deeply .
for the elephants , the rangers and the many issues
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman
more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .
And most of that growth is not in the cities ,
&quot; We need to document this , and here &apos;s my proposal .
Let &apos;s go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , you know , that might be a bit ambitious for our budget . &quot;
we decided to , instead of going out and doing what would result
in what we &apos;d consider sort of a survey story --
where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --
and let him stay there , and really get into
the heart and soul of this really major part of the city .
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look
at the awful conditions that exist in such places .
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part
Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit
Sometimes , though , the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture .
We weren &apos;t the only ones to tackle this subject ,
are among the best to capture both the human
And Brian then went on to even greater risk
where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals ,
the main parts having already been sent to Europe .
And here in China , Randy shot a jellyfish market .
and I think anytime we &apos;re doing a big , big story on this ,
the result being that the overfished species have been restored ,
and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries .
James Nachtwey , who was honored at last year &apos;s TED ,
took a look at the sweep of the medical system
that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq .
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end
Here , a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier
on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital .
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter
tattooed across his chest , as a reminder of home .
back to Germany , where they meet up with their families
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans &apos; hospitals ,
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story
and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .
simply encounter things that are , when it comes down to it ,
They have been rarely photographed , partly because they are considered
one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean .
In fact , a year earlier , a researcher had been
grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed .
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant
Now , what leopard seals do mostly is , they eat penguins .
This is sort of the munch of the penguins .
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .
And he said he was never really afraid of this .
She &apos;s probably -- it &apos;s a shame you can &apos;t see it in the photograph ,
because she was more curious about him than threatened .
was really her way of saying to him , &quot; Hey , look how big I am ! &quot;
Or you know , &quot; My , what big teeth you have . &quot;
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him .
To her , here was this big , goofy creature in the water
that for some reason didn &apos;t seem to be interested
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him ,
She dropped them off , and then they would swim away .
She &apos;d kind of look at him , like &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Go back and get them , and then bring them back
And she did this over the course of a couple of days ,
until the point where she got so frustrated with him
that she started putting them directly on top of his head .
And lost interest with him , and went back to what she does best .
and came back with not just a collection of photographs ,
ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people ,
I start speaking English , learning English , about a year ago .
I speak French and I grew up with French , so my English is Franglais .
I &apos;m born in the Western Congo , in an area around here ,
And after I finished , I went to this area , the Ituri Forest .
when I was about 14 , I grew in my uncle &apos;s house .
and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .
What I &apos;ve been doing from 14 to 17 was ,
and whatever they were killing , poaching , hunting in the forest ,
bring it in the main city to get access to the market .
Around 17 to 20 years , I became , myself , a poacher .
And I wanted to do it , because -- I believed -- to continue my studies .
I wanted to go to university , but my father was poor , my uncle even .
And for three to four years , I went to university .
For three times , I applied to biomedical science , to be a doctor .
I was having my inscriptions , my admission to biology .
And I said , &quot; No way , I &apos;m not doing it .
My family &apos;s poor , my area don &apos;t have better health care .
I want to be a doctor to serve them . &quot;
Three times , that means three years , and I start getting old .
When I finished , I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship .
It &apos;s where I really getting passion with what I &apos;m doing
right up to now -- I &apos;m standing in front of you --
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve
I think that is the largest number of elephants
we have right now in protected areas in Congo .
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa .
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society , working there , in 1995,
but I started working with them as a student in 1991 .
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university
But I didn &apos;t like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor .
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center .
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko ,
that most of you know , life became very , very difficult .
was completely difficult to do and to achieve it .
So they started fleeing from the east to the west .
so there was a road from Goma , somewhere here ,
So they might go through , pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve .
Congo has five of the world &apos;s richest sites of protected area ,
and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them .
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve .
Torture , wars -- oh , my God , you can &apos;t believe .
Every person was looking his way -- where to go , we don &apos;t know .
And it was for us , the young , the first time really
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,
after our independence , they didn &apos;t believe what was happening .
They were killing people . They were doing whatever they want
You can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has guns .
But I was from the west , working in the east .
I even &#91; at &#93; that time was not speaking Swahili .
You can &apos;t speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu ,
And I was from the same area to him .
All my friends said , we are leaving because we are a target .
But I &apos;m not going to the east , because I don &apos;t know Swahili .
I stay . If I go , I will be killed .
I can &apos;t go back to my area -- it &apos;s more than 1,000 kilometers &#91; away &#93; .
and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants .
for the study of the flora and the change of the forest .
And this is a bright guy , hard-working person , and Pygmy .
And with soldiers , they went to the forest for poaching elephants .
Because he &apos;s Pygmy , he knows how to track elephants in the forest .
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest .
They came to told me , I have to save him .
And what I did , I gave him just antibiotics
I think all of you here have a cell phone .
five millions of Congolese have gone because of this
and it has been in that area , all over in Congo . Extraction ,
And what I did for the first war , after we have lost everything ,
I have to save something , even myself , my life and life of the staff .
I buried some of our new vehicle engines , I buried it to save it .
on the top of the canopy , to save it .
He &apos;s not collecting plants , he &apos;s going to save our equipment
because they wanted to destroy it , to burn it ,
they didn &apos;t understand it , they didn &apos;t go to school --
And that is me , going to , hurrying to Uganda ,
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University .
And after the war , I have been able to bring it back home ,
The second war came while we didn &apos;t expect it .
With friends , we had been sitting and watching match football ,
We heard that now from the east again the war started ,
This time I think Kabila will go in place of , as he did with Mobutu .
And the reserve was a target to the rebels .
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area
And that &apos;s the powerful men . We have to meet and to talk to them .
convincing them that we are in a protected area .
that it &apos;s prohibited to do logging , mining and poaching , specifically .
you think that soldiers who are dying are not important ,
and your animals you are protecting are most important .
We have to do it , because to let our movement advance . &quot;
I say , &quot; No way , you are not going to do it here . &quot;
We started talking with them and I was negotiating .
Tried to protect our equipment , tried to protect our staff
Sometimes , they talk to my own language , that is , Lingala .
I hear it and what strategy they are doing , what they are planning .
They used me to carry that , and I was doing counting ,
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone , my computer
and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest .
I go , I write a short email , send it .
I don &apos;t know how many people I had on my address .
I sent the message : what is going about the progress of the war
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning ,
and the afternoon , it &apos;s on the news , BBC , RFI .
One day , we went to meet the Chief Commander .
He had the same iridium cell phone like me .
And he asked me , &quot; Do you know how to use this ? &quot;
So , it was a chance that they trusted me a lot .
They didn &apos;t -- they was not looking on me .
And when we finished the meeting , I went to return it in the forest .
reporting daily to the U.N. , to UNESCO , to our institution in New York ,
And for that , they have been having big pressure to leave , to free the area .
During the first two rebellions , they killed all animals in the zoo .
We have a zoo of 14 Okapis , and one of them was pregnant .
And during the war , after a week of heavy war , fighting in the area ,
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this .
that they have protected the Okapi with the war ,
because we sent the news that they are killing
After a week , we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi ,
they killed an elephant , just 50 meters to the area
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it ,
until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander .
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks .
What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war --
I had some money . I was paid 150 dollars .
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,
because we didn &apos;t have good infrastructure to start plants .
and start fundraising money to where I &apos;ve been going .
And they supported me a bit , and I built this .
And also , what one of the speciality we are doing ,
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity ,
and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon .
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot ,
where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters ,
to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions .
And that is -- I think it &apos;s difficult for me .
I don &apos;t know where to start , where to finish it .
what best title I wanted to say to my talk , I didn &apos;t find this .
But now I think that I would have titled it , &quot; The Language of Guns . &quot;
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild , or is it a game ?
I think we see the war like a game --
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have .
And I think , helping us , people are acting sometimes by ignorance .
Many , many of you have seen the talents of Africans ,
but there are few who are going to school .
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics ,
What you can assist us , it &apos;s by building capacities .
And go -- now , I &apos;m in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.
But many of them are just here , because they don &apos;t have money .
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs ,
They are very important to how we communicate with each other .
As a result , we &apos;re tuned in to the subtlest things
that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering ,
in order to believe whether these things are realistic .
And what I &apos;m going to do in the next five minutes
where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face ,
and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics .
And we &apos;re going to try to do a photo-real face
of an actress named Emily O &apos;Brien , who is right there .
And that &apos;s actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face .
By the end of the talk , we &apos;re going to see it move .
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself ,
who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory
in Marina Del Rey , and sit for a session in Light Stage 5 .
This is a face-scanning sphere , with 156 white LEDs all around
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this .
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .
with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face ,
and different principle directions of light from the light stage ,
If we zoom in on this photograph right here ,
we can see it &apos;s a really nice photograph to have of her ,
because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time
to get a nice image of her facial texture .
And in addition , we &apos;ve actually used polarizers on all the lights --
polarizers can block the shine off of the skin ,
so we don &apos;t get all those specular reflections to take this map .
Now , if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit ,
and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point .
If you take the difference between these two images here ,
you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light
I don &apos;t think any photograph like this had ever been taken
because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin .
And , as a result , it &apos;s a very good cue
and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have ,
the things that actually make us look like real humans .
So , if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection ,
that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape ,
that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles .
since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture ,
So , here you can see her moving her eyes around , moving her mouth around .
And these we &apos;re actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character .
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily ,
you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things
You can see things . Not only the face shape changes ,
but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs .
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there .
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down .
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that .
since it &apos;s all captured with cameras , we &apos;ve got a great texture map to use for the face .
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination ,
we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer .
it actually looks like it &apos;s made out of living human flesh .
But they basically created a digital puppet of her ,
and it actually moves her face in ways that are
to create a set of what are called &quot; displacement maps &quot;
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates .
So the next process was then to animate her .
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data .
So , by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques ,
So what you &apos;re going to see now , after this ,
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
Emily : Image Metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
Paul Debevec : So , if we break that down into layers , here &apos;s that diffuse component
We &apos;ve gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5 . This is Light Stage 6,
This is Bruce Lawmen , one of our researchers in the group ,
who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage .
And let &apos;s take a look at a computer-generated version
is what many believe will be the world &apos;s deepest natural abyss .
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing .
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year
had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like ,
is that technology has enabled us to go to these places
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity .
Along the way we &apos;ve discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large
When you go on a thing like this , we can usually be in the field
with a team as small as 20 or 30 , to as big as 150 .
And a lot of people ask me , you know ,
what kind of people do you get for a project like this ?
is not as rigorous as NASA , it &apos;s nonetheless thorough .
In case you &apos;re wondering , this is our strength test .
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance .
From the entrance , this is nothing like a commercial cave .
You &apos;re looking at Camp Two in a place called J2 , not K2 , but J2 .
We &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
And it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse ,
except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort
while you &apos;re down there , otherwise in damp , moist , cold conditions in utterly dark places .
I should mention that everything you &apos;re seeing here , by the way ,
The deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water .
It &apos;s basically like a tree collecting water coming down .
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
So I &apos;ve got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s .
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film .
Along that same line , I have to tell you
that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year ,
that begins to hit every member of the team
once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance .
Next year I &apos;ll be leading an international team to J2 .
We &apos;re going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight .
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s been a mission like that in a long time .
Eventually , if you keep going down in these things ,
probability says that you &apos;re going to run into a place like this .
It &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a fold in the geologic stratum
they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon .
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons .
Number one , it &apos;s the name of my rock band , and second ,
many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this .
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally
underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater .
When you do this kind of stuff it &apos;s like doing EVA .
but at much greater distances , and at much greater physical peril .
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment
of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before .
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet .
Bill Stone : That was taken in Wakulla Springs , Florida .
Couple of things to note about that movie . Every piece of equipment
that you saw in there did not exist before 1999 .
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper ,
and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done
of a cave , and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs .
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day .
This is one of the places where planetary scientists
believe there is a highest probability of the detection
of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .
couple of years ago , called &quot; Aliens of the Deep . &quot;
Narrator : A mission to explore under the ice of Europa
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light ,
it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle .
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards
and to find a good landing site on the ice .
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
Week after week , the melt probe will sink of its own weight
Now , what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean ?
It needs to be one smart puppy , able to navigate
and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean .
BS : What Jim didn &apos;t know when he released that movie
was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled
I mean , I cut through three years of engineering meetings , design
And as the movie says , this is one smart puppy .
packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent .
the world &apos;s deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico .
It &apos;s been explored to a depth of 292 meters
One is , how do you do science autonomy underground ?
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ?
than I &apos;ve got time to tell you about , but basically we drive
through the space , we populate it with environmental variables --
We calculate gradient surfaces , and drive the bot over to a wall
We move along the wall , in what &apos;s called proximity operations ,
If we see something that looks interesting , we pull it into a microscope .
If it passes the microscopic test , we go for a collection .
or we can actually take a solid core from the wall .
that &apos;s being conducted by the robot on its own .
known as 3D SLAM , for simultaneous localization and mapping .
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time ,
This May , we &apos;re going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton ,
and if we &apos;re very lucky , DEPTHX will bring back the first
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then ,
if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go ,
we could potentially launch by 2016 , and by 2019
we may have the first evidence of life off this planet .
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion
of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago .
if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime .
What I &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
And I hope you &apos;ll bear with me and have some faith
that there &apos;s credibility behind what we &apos;re going to say here .
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately .
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world
have got this in their sights and I salute them .
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .
Orbital hotels to start with , but workshops for the rest of us later on .
The final missing piece , the real paradigm-buster , is this :
If it existed , it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning .
I &apos;ve got to give you the basics of Space 101 .
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram .
The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant .
Thus , every time you &apos;d want to do anything in space ,
you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics .
So , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?
In fact , you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower
by the Pentagon , 13 years ago now , called Clementine .
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water
buried in the sediment , collected over millions and billions of years
If we &apos;re going to get that , and make that gas station possible ,
we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .
This is an idea that , again , came out of Livermore back in 1989,
And we can extend that now to just about everything .
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit .
We can build space tugs , orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water .
It says you &apos;re moving 10,000 feet per second faster
than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
You can burn rocket fuel to get there , or you can do something really incredible .
and precisely dissipate that velocity , and come back out to the space station .
It &apos;s risky and it &apos;s going to be one hell of a ride --
has been that you carry all the fuel you need
to get everybody back in case of an emergency .
If you try to do that for the moon ,
you &apos;re going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there .
Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez ?
This is not like that . I &apos;m much more like Scotty .
I like this equipment , you know , and I really value it
But , if you were truly bold you could get it there , manufacture it ,
that you could do something worthwhile off this planet
There &apos;s a myth that you can &apos;t do anything in space
for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years .
that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit .
We &apos;re living in one of the most exciting times in history .
and imagination are driving the demand for access to space .
could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed .
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial
they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit .
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED .
It can be done in seven years with the right backing .
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history
who , had they been here today , would have heartily approved .
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier .
Now we &apos;re at a time when boldness is required to move forward .
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words ,
I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon
that will open the space frontier , in our time , for all of us .
The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something .
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old
What I &apos;m going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create .
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within ,
because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me
if I said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity .
And I &apos;ve done it this way for half the audience , who is scientific .
When I say we , I don &apos;t mean you , necessarily ;
I mean me , and my right brain , my left brain
and the one that &apos;s in between that is the censor
And I &apos;m going do that also by looking at
what I think is part of my creative process ,
which includes a number of things that happened , actually --
Now in the nature area , we look at whether or not
And some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
would say that I get my material from past lives .
may be a function of some other neurological quirk --
van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of , you know , psychosis , or depression .
I do have to say , somebody -- I read recently
and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and I don &apos;t --
I suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
but it was during the time I was writing my last book ,
and some people say that book is quite different .
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis :
you know , who am I , why am I this particular person ,
but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity .
I used to draw . I thought I would be an artist .
And it wasn &apos;t bad , but it wasn &apos;t really creative .
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way .
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book .
And then , I also wasn &apos;t really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be ,
and you know , you look at those scores , and it wasn &apos;t bad ,
but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make
my living out of the artful arrangement of words .
Also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had ,
and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me .
figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old ,
and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age .
I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15,
But actually , there was something quite real in my life
And it was discovered that my brother , in 1967 , and then my father ,
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong ,
and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it .
My father was a Baptist minister , and he believed in miracles ,
and that God &apos;s will would take care of that .
But , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart .
And after that , my mother believed that it was fate , or curses
-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness .
And one of the reasons , she thought , was that her mother ,
who had died when she was very young , was angry at her .
And so , I had this notion of death all around me ,
because my mother also believed that I would be next , and she would be next .
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon ,
And they &apos;re the same ones that I have today .
And they are : why do things happen , and how do things happen ?
And the one my mother asked : how do I make things happen ?
It &apos;s a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story .
Because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300,
you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen ,
in what order they happen . What are the influences ?
How do I , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ?
And it &apos;s also one that , I think , many of our scientists have been asking .
It &apos;s a kind of cosmology , and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe ,
And you see , there &apos;s a lot of back and forth
in trying to make that happen , trying to figure it out
So , when I look at creativity , I also think that it is this sense or this inability
to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
And I got a lot of them during what &apos;s been going on
And so I &apos;m going to use , as the metaphor , this association :
but I &apos;m still gonna use it as the process
So , in quantum mechanics , of course , you have dark energy and dark matter .
And it &apos;s the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
There &apos;s a lot of unknown , and you often don &apos;t know what it is except by its absence .
you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story ,
and what you &apos;re finding is what matters . The meaning .
And that &apos;s what I look for in my work , a personal meaning .
There is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics ,
and you &apos;re looking at it in a different way ,
and you &apos;re trying to really look for the about-ness ,
or what is this story about . And if you try too hard ,
what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way ,
the other side of what happens in our universe ,
And so , I am going to just throw in string theory here ,
and there are 11 levels , I think , of anxiety .
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .
And you don &apos;t know what is operating , but something is operating there .
in my life , and I have it . Moral ambiguity .
It is constantly there . And , just as an example ,
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman
who was talking about the war in Iraq . And she said ,
&quot; Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
And that means because we went into Iraq , we should stay there
until things were solved . You know , maybe even 100 years .
So , there was another one that I came across ,
And they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed .
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning ,
-- actually , one of them is my mother &apos;s interpretation ,
and it is a famous Chinese saying , because she said it to me :
&quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
And it was a warning -- don &apos;t get involved in other people &apos;s business ,
OK . I think if somebody really was drowning , she &apos;d save them .
But , both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning ,
or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions .
And all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response .
There &apos;s an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do ,
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been .
Maybe things go wrong . And so , after that , what are our responsibilities ?
or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good ,
and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it ?
that really disturbed me , and led me to write a book called
I saw examples of that . Once I identified this question , it was all over the place .
And then , in a way , I knew that they had always been there .
And then writing , that &apos;s what happens . I get these hints , these clues ,
and I realize that they &apos;ve been obvious , and yet they have not been .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through
that question , and what happens is those particular things become relevant .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
You think there &apos;s a sort of coincidence going on , a serendipity ,
in which you &apos;re getting all this help from the universe .
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus .
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions .
Your brother , who &apos;s fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious
I was thinking that I shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if I did , it would show
And then , after a while , I had to ask myself ,
&quot; Why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up ,
and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father ,
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions ,
and still didn &apos;t know that if I went there ,
what the result of that would be , if I wrote a book --
and I just would have to face that later , when the time came .
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of .
We come to this point and say , what do I as an individual do ?
Not all of us can go to Africa , or work at hospitals ,
so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ?
Also , I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at ,
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable ,
I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child
-- and why am I here , and what is the meaning of my life ,
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
In writing a story , it is the place where I begin .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book ,
because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know .
from an overdose of opium , while having too much of a good time ,
I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself ,
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .
that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
And I took down this book , and I --
first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period ,
and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion ,
happening in the area near Guilin , outside of that ,
and a character who thought he was the son of God .
Well , what is random ? What is chance ? What is luck ?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day .
But I do think there &apos;s a kind of serendipity ,
and I do want to know what those elements are ,
so I can thank them , and also try to find them in my life .
Because , again , I think that when I am aware of them , more of them happen .
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place
-- I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place ,
and the third valley , there was something quite mysterious and ominous ,
a discomfort I felt . And then I knew that had to be &#91; the &#93; setting of my book .
And in writing one of the scenes , it happened in that third valley .
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building .
And I didn &apos;t know exactly why I had it , but it was so vivid .
I got stuck , and a friend , when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs ,
that I said , sure . And about 45 minutes later ,
and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything .
And I asked him , &quot; How is it possible to do this ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , I guess with everything in life , there &apos;s a place of balance . &quot;
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this , when I &apos;m writing a story ,
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain , like the cosmological constant ?
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
And as I said , my mother did not believe in randomness .
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are ,
I was able to see that in a firsthand way ,
when I went to beautiful Dong village , in Guizhou , the poorest province of China .
And I saw this beautiful place . I knew I wanted to come back .
And I had a chance to do that , when National Geographic asked me
And I said yes , about this village of singing people , singing minority .
And they agreed , and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went ,
there was a terrible accident . A man , an old man , fell asleep ,
and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm .
The man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
And , of course , as Westerners , we say , &quot; Well , it was an accident . That &apos;s not fair .
When I go on a story , I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs .
It takes a while , but I have to let go of them and just go there , and be there .
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons .
And I began to sense something different about the history ,
and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village ,
and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links
with other families . And I saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility .
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using ,
a ceremony they hadn &apos;t used in about 29 years . And it was to send some men
-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses .
would say well , that &apos;s superstition . But after being there for a while ,
you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world ,
So I remained with them , and the more I wrote that story ,
the more I got into those beliefs , and I think that &apos;s important for me
-- to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real ,
and that is where I &apos;m gonna find the answers
to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life .
Years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly ,
as I &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at TED .
The book comes and it goes . When it arrives , it is no longer my book .
It is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently .
But I go back to this question of , how do I create something out of nothing ?
and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths .
and what is happening in the story at that point .
I also believe that in thinking about things --
my thinking about luck , and fate , and coincidences and accidents ,
God &apos;s will , and the synchrony of mysterious forces --
I will come to some notion of what that is , how we create .
I have to think of my role . Where I am in the universe ,
and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something I came up with ?
And I also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined --
and yet is in that real world , the fictional world .
And that is how I find particles of truth , not the absolute truth , or the whole truth .
Or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind
and that is good , because then I will discover something new .
And if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me ,
And to imagine is to put myself in that story ,
until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating .
And that &apos;s how I &apos;ve discovered that if I feel what is in the story
-- in one story -- then I come the closest , I think ,
to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling .
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that .
and I will reveal what is in the bag , and it is the muse ,
and it is the things that transform in our lives ,
I &apos;m going to give you four specific examples -- and I &apos;m going to cover at the end --
about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing ,
how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody
to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact ,
to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years ,
a record label I started that had a CD called &quot; Sauce . &quot;
Before I can do that I &apos;ve got to tell you about sliced bread , and a guy named Otto Rohwedder .
Now , before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread ,
and he focused , like most inventors did , on the patent part and the making part .
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this --
that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available
no one bought it ; no one knew about it ; it was a complete and total failure .
And the reason is that until Wonder came along
and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it .
like the success of almost everything we &apos;ve been talking about at this conference ,
is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like --
it &apos;s about can you get your idea to spread , or not .
And I think that the way you &apos;re going to get what you want ,
or cause the change that you want to change , to happen ,
is that you &apos;ve got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread .
And it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you &apos;re running a coffee shop
or you &apos;re an intellectual , or you &apos;re in business , or you &apos;re flying hot air balloons .
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do .
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion .
That people who can spread ideas , regardless of what those ideas are , win .
And when I talk about it I usually pick business
because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation ,
and because it &apos;s the easiest sort of way to keep score .
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples
because I &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV .
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .
The way the TV-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads --
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .
the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
And that model of , and we heard it yesterday ,
if we could only get onto the homepage of Google ,
if we could only figure out how to get promoted there ,
if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat ,
and tell them about what we want to do .
If we do that then everyone would pay attention , and we would win .
Well , this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .
I mean , all of these products succeeded because someone figured out
how to touch people in a way they weren &apos;t expecting ,
in a way they didn &apos;t necessarily want , with an ad ,
over and over and over again until they bought it .
And the thing that &apos;s happened is , they canceled the TV-industrial complex .
is that it &apos;s not working the way that it used to .
This picture is really fuzzy , I apologize ; I had a bad cold when I took it .
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child .
Right . I go to the deli ; I &apos;m sick ; I need to buy some medicine .
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam
And I ignored every message because I don &apos;t have a pain reliever problem .
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have .
And I &apos;m not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem ,
Here &apos;s a magazine called &quot; Hydrate . &quot; It &apos;s 180 pages about water .
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago
when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek .
OK . Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks ,
because they have no idea what &apos;s going to work and what &apos;s not .
I couldn &apos;t have written this better myself . It came out four days ago --
I circled the important parts so you can see them here .
They &apos;ve come out ... Arby &apos;s is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt
hoping that that will get people to go to Arby &apos;s and buy a roast beef sandwich .
Now , I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial
featuring Tom Arnold , that would get you to get in your car ,
drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich .
when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea .
The world revolves around me . Me , me , me , me , me . My favorite person -- me .
I don &apos;t want to get email from anybody ; I want to get &quot; memail . &quot;
So consumers , and I don &apos;t just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway ;
I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something ,
or people at , you know , the New Yorker who might print your article .
Consumers don &apos;t care about you at all ; they just don &apos;t care .
Part of the reason is -- they &apos;ve got way more choices than they used to ,
And in a world where we have too many choices
and too little time , the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff .
And my parable here is you &apos;re driving down the road
and you see a cow , and you keep driving
Who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . Nobody .
But if the cow was purple -- isn &apos;t that a great special effect ?
I could do that again if you want it .
If the cow was purple , you &apos;d notice it for a while .
I mean , if all cows were purple you &apos;d get bored with those , too .
The thing that &apos;s going to decide what gets talked about ,
And &quot; remarkable &quot; is a really cool word because we think it just means neat ,
but it also means -- worth making a remark about .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car ,
big enough to hold a mini in its trunk .
People are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .
it &apos;s always some third rate movie with some second rate star .
But the reason it &apos;s number one is because that &apos;s the week it came out .
Because people saw it and said -- I didn &apos;t know that was there --
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail --
one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box ,
and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them .
The only thing they have in common is that they &apos;re different .
We &apos;re now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living ,
And the thing is , people in the fashion business
know what it &apos;s like to be in the fashion business -- they &apos;re used to it .
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .
How to understand that it &apos;s not about interrupting people with big full-page ads ,
But it &apos;s a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread ,
This chair -- they sold a billion dollars &apos; worth of Aeron chairs
by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair .
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought ,
to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
This guy , Lionel Poilane , the most famous baker in the world --
and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend .
He lived in Paris . Last year he sold 10 million dollars &apos; worth of French bread .
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned , by one baker at a time , in a wood-fired oven .
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .
They didn &apos;t want to buy his bread . It didn &apos;t look like &quot; French bread . &quot;
It was neat ; it was remarkable ; and slowly it spread from one person to another person
until finally , it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris .
Now he &apos;s in London , and he ships by FedEx all around the world .
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people .
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken ,
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a strategy we want to use any more .
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
on the rest of the curve , and it &apos;ll spread .
They have something I call &quot; otaku &quot; -- it &apos;s a great Japanese word .
It describes the desire of someone who &apos;s obsessed to say ,
drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place ,
because that &apos;s what they do : they get obsessed with it .
to come up with any problem you want to solve
Instead , you have to find a group that really ,
desperately cares about what it is you have to say .
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
There &apos;s a hot sauce otaku , but there &apos;s no mustard otaku .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces ,
but people don &apos;t because no one &apos;s obsessed with it ,
Krispy Kreme has a strategy , and what they do is ,
they enter a city , they talk to the people with otaku ,
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes .
They want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it &apos;ll spread .
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
It &apos;s as loud as a 747 jet . You can &apos;t get in the car ;
wants to put a couple of speakers in their car ,
It &apos;s really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening ,
and maybe , just maybe those people tell their friends .
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote , right ,
that &apos;s the only thing keeping his company in business --
to watch a two-hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku ,
and then they tell their friends , and it spreads and it spreads .
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
but to the people who love it , they talk about it like crazy .
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company ,
making them a fortune . It costs 35 percent more than regular paint
because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about , because it &apos;s remarkable .
They didn &apos;t just slap a new ad on the product ;
they changed what it meant to build a paint product .
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site ,
run by two volunteers , and I can tell you they are hard graders , and
they didn &apos;t get this way by advertising a lot .
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back ,
And every single person who walks into his office
hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
After you &apos;re cremated you can have yourself made into a gem .
But you don &apos;t have to be Ozzie Osborne --
you don &apos;t have to be super-outrageous to do this .
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them .
The first one is : Design is free when you get to scale .
And the people who come up with stuff that &apos;s remarkable
more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .
Number two : The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe .
That &apos;s risky . The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes ,
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re making a record album ,
or you &apos;re an architect , or you have a tract on sociology .
If it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s not going to work , because no one &apos;s going to notice it .
Silk . Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section
For the people who were there and looking at that section ,
That is a remarkable piece of art . You don &apos;t have to like it ,
but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes
in the middle of New York City is remarkable .
by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see .
they said , we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry ?
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
And my big failure ? I came out with an entire
record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums
in SACD format -- this remarkable new format --
and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos .
So what you need to do is figure out who does care .
Who is going to raise their hand and say ,
As you can see , if that &apos;s nowhere , it &apos;s in the middle of it .
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake .
They don &apos;t anymore . So the founding fathers said , &quot; We &apos;ve got some money to spend .
What can we build here ? &quot; And like most committees ,
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist &apos;s rendering --
he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town .
I don &apos;t know about you but if they build it , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to go .
I would like to share with you this morning
because I fell in love with the sea as a child .
about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater ,
at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I &apos;m at sea .
And I &apos;ve been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues
The first story that I did for National Geographic ,
was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year
where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic
to engage in courtship , mating and to have their pups .
I wanted to do this story from both above and below ,
to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups
making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water .
But as I got more involved in the story ,
I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn &apos;t ignore .
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted ,
killed with hakapiks at about eight , 15 days old .
with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year .
is the loss of sea ice due to global warming .
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows
the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season .
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture ,
there &apos;s a lot of water as well , which wasn &apos;t there historically .
And the ice that is there is quite thin .
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice
They only need 12 days from the moment they &apos;re born until they &apos;re on their own .
one of these pups that &apos;s only about five or seven days old --
still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --
that has fallen in because of the thin ice ,
and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there .
I read that last year the pup mortality rate
was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence .
So , clearly , this species has a lot of problems going forward .
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic .
And with that , I saw the potential to begin
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis ,
a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years ,
that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean
have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years .
These are the tuna , the billfish and the sharks .
When I read that , I was blown away by those numbers .
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet ,
but it really wasn &apos;t , so I wanted to do a story
that was a very different kind of underwater story .
I wanted it to be more like war photography ,
The first component of the story that I thought was essential , however ,
You know , I think people go into a restaurant ,
and somebody orders a steak , and we all know where steak comes from ,
and somebody orders a chicken , and we know what a chicken is ,
do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they &apos;re consuming ?
These are the lions and tigers of the sea .
and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year .
If we weren &apos;t so efficient at catching them , because they grow their entire life ,
would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton .
But the truth is we &apos;re way too efficient at catching them ,
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market
And every single day these tuna , bluefin like this ,
it sort of occurred to me that the ocean &apos;s not a grocery store , you know .
I also , with the story , wanted to show readers
how fish are caught , some of the methods that are used to catch fish ,
like a bottom trawler , which is one of the most common methods in the world .
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp ,
but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
And as this assembly is towed through the water ,
and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom .
And this just drags over the bottom , in this case to catch shrimp .
But as you can imagine , it &apos;s catching everything else in its path as well .
And it &apos;s destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom ,
holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour .
So he had a handful of shrimp , maybe seven or eight shrimp ,
and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch .
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,
and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .
And to make that point even more visual , I swam under the shrimp boat
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry
But before I went out to photograph this component ,
I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark
You know , I think there &apos;s still a lot of people out there who think
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher
that had just recently died in the gill net .
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible ,
it struck me as sort of a crucifixion , if you will .
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice
And because I love sharks -- I &apos;m somewhat obsessed with sharks --
I wanted to do another , more celebratory , story about sharks ,
as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .
but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy ,
largely due to the fact that the government there
that we hadn &apos;t shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations .
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach ,
showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks
But the one thing I definitely didn &apos;t want to do with this coverage
was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters .
I didn &apos;t want them to be overly threatening or scary .
I sort of think I got to that goal ,
where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose ,
and my strobe created a shadow on her face .
And I think it &apos;s a gentler picture , a little less threatening ,
But this is an animal that &apos;s considered data deficient by science
We don &apos;t know where they migrate to or from ,
have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years .
You know , we &apos;re losing them faster than we can possibly find them .
an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species ,
But it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water ,
and my friend , shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage .
You &apos;ll see that the photographer , of course , was not inside the cage here ,
so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess .
I also wanted to focus on baby sharks , shark nurseries .
And I went to the island of Bimini , in the Bahamas ,
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup ,
and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives
It &apos;s not what you typically might think of as a shark picture .
But , you know , here we see a shark that &apos;s maybe 10 or 11 inches long
But this is crucial habitat and it &apos;s where they spend the first two , three years of their lives ,
until they &apos;re big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle .
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years .
where they were coming out of the water to nest
about to taste saltwater for the very first time
like vultures that pick them off on a beach
But what they can &apos;t deal with is anthropogenic stresses ,
a leatherback caught at night in a gill net .
I cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free .
But , you know , thousands of other leatherbacks each year
is the story I did on the right whale .
And essentially , the story is this with right whales ,
but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated ,
We have the Southern right whale that we see here
and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here
with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida .
Now , both species were hunted to the brink of extinction
but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better
because they are urban whales ; they live along the east coast
and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida .
You can see the coal burning plant in the background .
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale .
but most don &apos;t shed the gear , things like lobster traps and crab pots .
They hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
And the other problem is they get hit by ships .
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population ,
I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales
that had only been discovered about 10 years ago
in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand , a place called the Auckland Islands .
And these are animals that had never seen humans before ,
and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .
and I was amazed at how curious they were .
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet
like a city bus just swimming up , you know .
You know , I read that the pilgrims , when they landed at Plymouth Rock
wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay
And we can &apos;t go back and see that today ,
but maybe we can preserve what we have left .
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope ,
to the problem of overfishing , the global fish crisis story .
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand
and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean .
And I really wanted this story to be about three things :
they hoped and expected that certain things might happen .
For example , they hoped that certain species of fish
because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .
And they did come back . What they couldn &apos;t predict was that other things would happen .
low and behold , kelp forests emerged in shallow water .
You know , this is probably how the ocean looked here
one or 200 years ago , but nobody was around to tell us .
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well ,
like in Fiordland , where this sea pen colony was found .
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .
I dove in the blue water , where the water &apos;s a little warmer ,
that is a very important animal in this ecosystem
because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold .
a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand
And I was in a place that had only been protected
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years ,
and they said that the marine life was better here today
The ocean is , indeed , resilient and tolerant to a point ,
and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it ,
I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years ,
as it is to save the world in online games .
Right now we spend three billion hours a week
&quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough
game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survive
at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea ,
so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in :
sums up why I think games are so essential
to the future survival of the human species . Truly .
This is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano .
so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing .
you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .
deep , deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth
This is a gamer who is on the verge of something called
you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
to discover what you are truly capable of . That is an epic win .
This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
And this is the face that we need to see
as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century --
Now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see
in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face ,
and this is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . Good .
This is actually me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood
on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
And I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful ,
We do achieve more in game worlds . But I also
the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice ,
as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
We never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games ,
So , I looked at games like World of Warcraft ,
that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
So , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games ,
who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away .
But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched
They never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
But it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of . So , you have to try hard ,
there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
That &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily ,
And also there is this epic story , this inspiring story
You guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength ,
We don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
When I get off this stage I &apos;m not going to have
to be on the verge of an epic win all the time
that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers
was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
Okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing
in playing games , the only way it makes sense
to even think about it is to talk about time
We are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University :
First of all , for children in the United States
as they are learning about everything else in school .
So , you would have heard of his theory of success ,
by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it .
We will be as good at whatever we do
This is how many people we now have in the world
who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks
They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
So , I &apos;ve started to think about what these games
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is urgent optimism .
Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible ,
and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
that we like people better after we play a game with them ,
And the reason is , it takes a lot of trust
We trust that they will spend their time with us ,
value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
And so , playing a game together actually builds up
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
You know there &apos;s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game ,
working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out .
We know that we are optimized , as human beings ,
all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
So , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective :
So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
Second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles ,
They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft
topic covered on any other wiki in the world .
Okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing :
These are people who believe that they are individually capable
Not like me -- I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
in games than they can have in real life ;
So , he says for now it makes perfect sense
for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
We have to start making the real world more like a game .
So , I take my inspiration from something that happened
These are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s knuckles . Right ?
And if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian
that the king of Lydia decided that they had to do something crazy .
and on the next day , everybody would play games .
And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games
they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
And then on the next day , they would play games ;
by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
We &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken
in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life ,
so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
and they would go out in search of a new place to live ,
actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians .
for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine .
and knew so much about how to come together with games ,
that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
from the World of Warcraft series . That was 16 years ago .
I say we are ready for our own epic game .
so that &apos;s where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from .
Now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve real world problems
in games ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I have devoted my work to
We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto ,
and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
We do not want to try to predict the future .
What we want to do is make the future .
and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
I &apos;m just going to very briefly show you three games that I &apos;ve made
that are an attempt to give people the means
This is an online game in which you try to survive
for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life
as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . So when you come to the game ,
you sign up , you tell us where you live ,
what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected ,
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life
as if this were true . And then we ask you to blog about it ,
We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007,
and we &apos;ve tracked them for the three years since .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
But if you immerse them in an epic adventure
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
most of our players have kept up the habits
we decided to aim higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , you form a dream team --
and they all have something to do to save the world .
But in our game , instead of just having five people
on the dream team , we said , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team ,
and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy ,
the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
that you can go online , if you Google &quot; Superstruct , &quot; and see .
we &apos;re launching it March 3rd . This is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
If you complete the game you will be certified
and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up
we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do ,
but none of them have saved the real world yet .
Well I hope that you will agree with me
this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
And that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me
that we can make any future we can imagine ,
because I think that we just might be about 150 years
at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century .
And after that , most likely it &apos;s going to begin to decline .
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth .
One : fewer people on a fixed amount of land
In the cities , a lot of the cost of property
that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class .
Now I &apos;m not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death .
Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward ,
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden ,
about two generations after the top of that curve ,
At that point , we &apos;ll start romanticizing the future again ,
there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future .
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .
If we have a positive view about the future
then we may be able to accelerate through that turn ,
If we can make it through the next 150 years ,
I was walking in the market one day with my wife ,
There was a very sick orangutan baby , my first encounter .
That evening I came back to the market in the dark
and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap .
She &apos;s now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain ,
which , by the way , is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued , Dodoy .
and as of today , I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers .
It &apos;s horrible . It &apos;s a proof of our failing to save them in the wild .
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing .
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together ,
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat ,
the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .
that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world ,
And we don &apos;t have any industry at all --
I &apos;m not going to talk too long about it ,
but there are so many of the family of Uce ,
which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest ,
And I don &apos;t know anymore where to put them .
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her
that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests ,
if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of
no one will have an excuse to say , &quot; Yeah , but ... &quot;
So we &apos;re in East Borneo . This is the place where I started .
There &apos;s nothing left -- just a bit of grass there .
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there .
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water .
This was the poorest district in the whole province
When I stood there in the grass , it &apos;s hot -- not even the sound of insects --
Still , four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people .
We &apos;ve got over 1,000 species . We have 137 bird species as of today .
So what happened here ? We created a huge economic failure in this forest .
had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm .
so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there ;
and after a while you &apos;re stuck with an area of land
where you can see our very first office there on that hill ,
four years later , there is this one green blop on the Earth &apos;s surface ...
And there are all these animals , and all these people happy ,
It was quite simple . If you &apos;ll look at the steps :
we bought the land , we dealt with the fire ,
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary .
But we made sure that in every step of the way
the local people were going to be fully involved
so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that .
The people would become the defenders of that forest .
people say , &quot; It belongs to me , it belongs to everyone . &quot;
how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control ,
whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out .
Now in this recipe you also have the cost .
If you can drop this recipe on the map
you put those different recipes ; if you combine them ,
comes a work plan , and you can optimize it
for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have ,
This is how it looks like in practice . We have this grass we want to get rid of .
The acacia trees are of a very low value
but we need them to restore the micro-climate , to protect the soil
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber --
that is , if you can preserve it in the right way ,
So if we would plant that in the beginning
we would have a very high risk of losing everything again .
just in time for when the timber becomes available .
So the idea is : how to integrate these flows
in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
So we plant the trees , we plant these pineapples
and beans and ginger in between , to reduce the competition for the trees ,
the crop fertilizer . Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops ,
for the people , but also helps the trees . The farmers have free land ,
the system yields early income , the orangutans get healthy food
Not really , because if you looked at what happened in 1998,
This is an area of about 50 million hectares .
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months .
This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires
that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States .
And once the soil gets dried , you &apos;re in a dry season -- you get cracks ,
oxygen goes in , flames come out and the problem starts all over again .
This is what it looked like for three months .
For three months , the automatic lights outside did not go off
We lost all the crops . No children gained weight for over a year ;
they lost 12 IQ points . It was a disaster
So these fires are really the first things to work on .
That was why I put it as a single point up there .
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands ,
once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm
and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients
to the first rainfall -- going to the sea
So you have to do it with the local people .
That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution .
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant --
and they provide a lot of income for local people .
the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice --
and the only thing you harvest is sugar water ,
carbon dioxide , rain fall and a little bit of sunshine .
And you can create so much energy from this --
they produce three times more energy per hectare per year ,
because you can tap them on a daily basis .
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics ,
which is still unexploited , and doing it in combination with technology .
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order .
and here is where we started our project --
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area
is divided into strips that go over different types of soil ,
measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares , 5,000 acres .
What I really did was I just followed nature ,
That means that both in the ground and above the ground
it can make better use of the available light ,
it can store more carbon in the system , it can provide more functions .
But , it &apos;s more complicated . It &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that ,
we grow the slower growing , primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity
what is just as important : get the right fungi in there
that will grow into those leaves , bring back the nutrients
to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours .
and without those microorganisms , you won &apos;t have any performance at all .
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day .
We could have planted many , many more , but we didn &apos;t want to
because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable .
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types ,
or what vegetables will grow , or what trees will grow here .
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space .
with strips of 100 meters wide , with sugar palms
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe , for instance ,
from the Urals up to England , you know how many ?
In this nursery , we &apos;re going to grow 10 times more than the number of species .
You do need to know what you are working with ,
by planting the vegetables and the trees , or directly , the trees
and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest
In the beginning , maybe pineapples and beans and corn ;
in the second phase , there will be bananas and papayas ;
bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood .
you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees
And that &apos;s green . If you look from the tower --
mixed with the bananas , the papayas , all the crops for the local people ,
but the trees are growing up fast in between as well .
And three years later , 137 species of birds are living here .
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius .
Cloud cover -- I &apos;m going to show it to you -- is up .
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency --
it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon , how the forest is developing ,
and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation .
to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology .
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks ,
you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced ,
but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back .
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced ,
And finally I made it into the rain machine
because this forest is now creating its own rain .
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water ;
and we have now a lot of intrusion there .
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest ;
we looked at the reforestation area , the semi-open area and the open area .
In the tropics , raindrops are not formed from ice crystals ,
you need the trees with &#91; unclear &#93; , chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate ,
and you have the trees to initiate the rain .
And look , there &apos;s now 11.2 percent more clouds --
If you look at rainfall , it was already up 20 percent at that time .
and you can see that that trend is continuing .
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall ,
above Samboja Lestari , it used to be the driest place ,
but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there .
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears ,
you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area .
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do ,
And it &apos;s nice to have the science , but it still depends mostly upon the people ,
But the real success of course , is our band --
because if a baby is born , we will play , so everyone &apos;s our family
which brings the people electricity and water from our own area .
and then we have this fence with very thorny palms
to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle --
as a gene bank to keep all that material alive ,
not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up
So now we do the monitoring on the inside --
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back .
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees --
you have the shade trees planted in year one ,
And after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees .
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel ,
and they can build a house , they have some fuel wood to cook with .
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like .
But whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully supported by the people ,
meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local , cultural values .
There is no simple one recipe for one place .
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt --
we divide that ring in groups of 20 families .
the other 19 members have to decide what &apos;s going to happen to him .
the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group
that doesn &apos;t comply with those great deals that we are offering them .
so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .
In summary , if you look at it , in year one the people can sell their land
to get income , but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation ,
the working with the orangutans , and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft .
They also get free land in between the trees ,
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project .
so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally .
And everything is based upon that one thing --
So if we want to help the orangutans --
we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit .
Now I think the real key to doing it , to give a simple answer ,
I hope -- if you want to know more , you can read more .
In the mornings it is terrible , and the afternoon is worst .
During many years , I made some speeches starting with this
saying : &quot; City is not a problem , it &apos;s a solution . &quot;
but it &apos;s a solution for the problem of climate change .
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities .
and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big ,
or the other mayors say , &quot; We don &apos;t have financial resources , &quot;
from the experience I had : every city in the world
There &apos;s no matter of scale . It &apos;s not a question of scale ,
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility
So to start , I want to introduce some characters
The best example of quality of life is the turtle
because the turtle is an example of living and working together .
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle
and can we imagine , if we cut the casque of the turtle , how sad she &apos;s going to be ?
And most of the people are leaving the city
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave .
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking ,
And on the other hand , Accordion , the friendly bus ,
Speaking about the design : every city has its own design .
Curitiba , my city : three million in the metropolitan area ,
But to make it happen , sometimes you have to propose a scenario
And that &apos;s the structure of the city of Curitiba .
And it &apos;s an example of living and working together .
So , this system started in &apos; 74 . We started with 25,000 passengers a day ,
And it took 25 years until another city ...
which is Bogota , and they did a very good job .
And now there &apos;s 83 cities all over the world that they
are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba .
And one thing : it &apos;s important not for only your own city ;
mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities .
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there .
the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway .
and you can pay before entering the bus you &apos;re boarding .
And for handicapped , they can use this as a normal system .
the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars --
more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars , it &apos;s ...
It &apos;s the concept of the city , the design of the city ,
that &apos;s also important , too . And also , how to teach the children .
We started in &apos; 83 , proposing for the city of Rio
And 23 years after , they called us to develop -- we &apos;re developing this idea .
And you can understand how different it &apos;s going to be ,
it &apos;s not being colored during the day , only at night
And before you say it &apos;s a Norman Foster design ,
how it &apos;s going to work . So , it &apos;s the same system ;
What I &apos;m trying to say is , I &apos;m not trying
never -- if you have a subway , if you have surface systems ,
And coming back to the car , I always used to say
So , when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law ,
So , all the ideas about how to transform through design --
old quarries and open universities and botanic garden --
all of it &apos;s related to how we teach the children .
And the children , we teach during six months how to separate their garbage .
since 20 years , it &apos;s the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world .
I would like to say , if we want to have a sustainable world
I &apos;m working in a museum and also a multi-use city ,
because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day .
that could play different roles during the 24 hours .
Another issue is , a city &apos;s like our family portrait .
even if we don &apos;t like the nose of our uncle ,
And these are the references that we have in any city .
we did it in 72 hours . Yes , you have to be fast .
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution .
the Ukrainian park , the Polish park , the Japanese square , the German park .
All of a sudden , the Soviet Union , they split .
Don &apos;t forget : creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget .
And this is the Wire Opera theater . We did it in two months .
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks .
So , in a city , you have to work fast .
That means me , with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning .
The smallest park in New York , the most beautiful :
that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials --
but keep in mind that we have to work fast
to the end , because we don &apos;t have the whole time to plan .
and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers --
it &apos;s important starting and having the contribution from people ,
At the end , I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song .
You &apos;re going to make the music and the rhythm .
? It &apos;s possible ! It &apos;s possible ! You can do it ! You can do it ! ?
? Use less your car ! Make this decision ! ?
? Avoid carbon emission ! It &apos;s possible ! It &apos;s possible ! ?
? You can do it ! You can do it ! ?
? Work closer to home ! Save energy in your home ! ?
? It &apos;s possible ! It &apos;s possible ! You can do it ! ?
? You can do it ! Separate your garbage ! ?
? Organic , schmorganic ! Save more ! Waste less ! It &apos;s possible ! ?
? You can do it ! Please , do it now ! ?
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box ,
which they put on their shelves , where they are now .
and he said , &quot; We &apos;re going to start putting them online .
Can we put yours online ? &quot; And I said , &quot; Sure . &quot;
as I said , it &apos;s been seen by four ...
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something
to get the number of people who &apos;ve seen it .
So , this whole event has been an elaborate build-up
to me doing another one for you , so here it is .
at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago
I mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously ,
and I think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more .
and that we have to deal with with the same urgency .
and you may say , by the way , &quot; Look , I &apos;m good .
But this is a crisis of , not natural resources --
as many speakers have said during the past few days ,
having no real sense of what their talents may be ,
Actually , I kind of divide the world into two groups now .
He said , &quot; There are two types of people in this world :
They get no great pleasure from what they do .
If you said to them , &quot; Don &apos;t do this anymore , &quot; they &apos;d wonder what you were talking about .
Because it isn &apos;t what they do , it &apos;s who they are . They say ,
It would be foolish for me to abandon this , because
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
and the word &apos;s been used many times during the course of the past few days --
that people don &apos;t find very easy , for the most part .
&quot; Well , it can &apos;t be done any other way because that &apos;s the way it &apos;s done . &quot;
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln ,
who I thought you &apos;d be pleased to have quoted at this point .
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time .
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy .
So , no doubt , something fascinating was happening in December 1862,
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to ,
as the natural order of things , the way things are .
have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century ,
but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries .
and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them .
It &apos;s very hard to know , by the way , what it is you take for granted .
And the reason is that you take it for granted .
So let me ask you something you may take for granted .
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
That &apos;s not what I think you take for granted ,
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
could you put your hands up if you &apos;re wearing your wristwatch ?
Now that &apos;s a great deal of us , isn &apos;t it ?
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .
I don &apos;t mean they can &apos;t or they &apos;re not allowed to ,
And the reason is , you see , that we were brought up
in a pre-digital culture , those of us over 25 .
And so for us , if you want to know the time
Kids now live in a world which is digitized ,
And by the way , you don &apos;t need to do it either ;
it &apos;s just that you &apos;ve always done it and you carry on doing it .
My daughter never wears a watch , my daughter Kate , who &apos;s 20 .
And I say , &quot; No , no , it tells the date as well . &quot;
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
that it starts here and you go through a track
and if you do everything right , you will end up
Everybody who &apos;s spoken at TED has told us implicitly ,
in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us .
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .
I don &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t go to college , but not everybody needs to go
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago
There was this guy buying a book , he was in his 30s .
And I said , &quot; How long have you been a fireman ? &quot;
He said , &quot; As a kid . &quot; He said , &quot; Actually , it was a problem for me at school ,
because at school , everybody wanted to be a fireman . &quot;
He said , &quot; But I wanted to be a fireman . &quot;
And he said , &quot; When I got to the senior year of school ,
if that &apos;s all I chose to do with it ;
that I should go to college , I should become a professional person ,
and I was wasting my talent to do that . &quot;
he said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful .
But it &apos;s what I wanted , and as soon as I left school ,
I applied to the fire service and I was accepted . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You know , I was thinking about that guy recently ,
just a few minutes ago when you were speaking , about this teacher , &quot;
He said , &quot; I think he thinks better of me now . &quot;
If we had time , I could go into this , but we don &apos;t .
&quot; You know , a three year-old is not half a six year-old . &quot;
But as we just heard in this last session ,
there &apos;s such competition now to get into kindergarten --
that people are being interviewed for it at three .
&quot; You &apos;ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &quot;
Spent the first six months breastfeeding , the way I can see it . &quot;
See , it &apos;s outrageous as a conception , but it &#91; unclear &#93; .
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
The other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants ,
And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education ,
as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies .
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here .
at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar .
You know , it worked out for Eric , that &apos;s all I &apos;m saying .
no matter how often or how hard I blew into it .
Often , people are good at things they don &apos;t really care for .
And if you &apos;re doing the thing that you love to do , that you &apos;re good at ,
You know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love ,
If you &apos;re doing something that doesn &apos;t resonate with your spirit ,
And the reason so many people are opting out of education
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education ,
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it ,
There are great ones , like KIPP &apos;s ; it &apos;s a great system .
but with external support based on a personalized curriculum .
And I urge you to get involved in it
But we have to change from the industrial model
Or at home , if that &apos;s where they choose to be educated
I was very struck by Natalie Merchant &apos;s songs last night ,
I wanted to read you a quick , very short poem
from W. B. Yeats , who some of you may know .
he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
And he says , &quot; I &apos;ve got something else , but it may not be for you . &quot;
Believe me or not , I come offering a solution
to a very important part of this larger problem ,
which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years
and , two , the only institution that is large enough ,
And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company ,
to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability ,
only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly --
that someday people like me would go to jail .
And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
what I meant by the &quot; go to jail &quot; remark ,
And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true --
for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime --
and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future ,
and converting it to products that quickly become waste
in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence ,
but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
Still it works to help us understand the problem .
a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy ,
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read
that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing --
Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes
must be changed to move T to the denominator .
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ;
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes ,
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production ,
The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold
from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation --
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home ,
and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
We reckon that we are a bit over halfway
We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero ,
for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up ,
of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste --
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
this false choice between the environment and the economy .
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 :
a dip when our sales , over a three-year period ,
And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos;
suggesting that it is a means to an end ,
if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us :
and all her natural systems for a thousand generations ,
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says ,
If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
a very dear person is at risk here --
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then ,
bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
&quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place ,
I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good ,
The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost ,
The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
is made possible by attachment to an iPod --
a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer .
and &quot; Judge Judy &quot; -- &quot; The people are real , the cases are real ,
but I &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life ,
it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry
we now realize that the Internet is , if anything ,
or an artist , who tries to attract the attention
that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time .
we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it ,
We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ,
attendant inconveniences of travel , parking and the like --
when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars
when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet
for those of us who work in this terrain .
Saddled in the performing arts as we are , by antiquated union agreements
and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues ,
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records
And for those of you who love the arts ,
aren &apos;t you glad you invited me here to brighten your day ?
Now , rather than saying that we &apos;re on the brink of our own annihilation ,
I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation ,
with indeed , the printing press really leading the charge
in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ?
editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of &quot; The Long Tail , &quot;
really was the first -- for me -- to nail a lot of this .
for the first time in all of human history .
In the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie ,
you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO
And now who in this room doesn &apos;t know a 14 year-old
hard at work on her second , third , or fourth movie ?
have been democratized for the first time in human history .
Again , in the &apos; 30s , Warner Brothers , RKO did that for you .
as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting .
our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary ,
just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end
for artists to have lives of economic dignity --
who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources
who works , not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage ;
or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more --
that the work that she or he , is called to do
by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada ,
whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,
is defined , not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals ,
but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles --
while today &apos;s playwrights and directors work with youth gangs
the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time
we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town .
I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community
generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy ,
at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes ,
the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more .
But the arts are going to be more important to economies
just as they have been central to the iPod
we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts
who all too often , are subjected to bombardment of sensation ,
in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is ,
The arts , whatever they do , whenever they call us together ,
invite us to look at our fellow human being
I salute all of you as activists in that quest
and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work ,
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come .
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon .
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen ,
What you just heard is &quot; Skylife &quot; by David Balakrishnan .
that he thought music should be from the heart .
This was in the middle of the 20th century
wasn &apos;t the most popular thing in the classical music world .
It &apos;s a great honor to be here with you .
I &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here
because I &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
And the good news is I don &apos;t have a prepared speech ,
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living .
that people remember pictures long after they &apos;ve forgotten words ,
and so I hope you &apos;ll remember some of the pictures
I &apos;m going to share with you for just a few minutes .
with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ,
in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .
I was walking down the corridor of my high school
kind of minding my own business . And there was this artist teaching ,
and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room --
and if you &apos;ve ever seen clay done , it &apos;s magic --
and I &apos;d never seen anything like that before in my life .
So , I walked in the art room and I said , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m Bill Strickland . I want you to teach me that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper
that says you can come here , and I &apos;ll teach it to you . &quot;
And so for the remaining two years of my high school ,
to give the teachers &apos; classes that I cut the pottery that I made ,
And that &apos;s how I got out of high school .
&quot; You &apos;re too smart to die and I don &apos;t want it on my conscience ,
so I &apos;m leaving this school and I &apos;m taking you with me . &quot;
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh
where I filled out a college application and got in on probation .
Don &apos;t give up on the poor kids , because you never know
what &apos;s going to happen to those children in life . &quot;
What I &apos;m going to show you for a couple of minutes
is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh
One is called Bidwell Training Center ; it is a vocational school
for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers .
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh ?
and the people who used to make the steel
And I rebuild them and give them new life .
by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots ,
and he donated a row house . And in that row house
and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians ,
And last year I spoke at his memorial service
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright , the architect ,
and I asked him to build me a world class center
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport .
And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you &apos;re all invited --
you &apos;ll be flying into the blown-up version of my building .
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead .
My view is that if you want to involve yourself
in the life of people who have been given up on ,
you have to look like the solution and not the problem .
As you can see , it has a fountain in the courtyard .
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one
and I had the checkbook , so I bought one and put it there .
And now that I &apos;m giving speeches at conferences like TED ,
I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum .
At a reception in their courtyard , I noticed that they had a fountain
because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain .
Well , I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids
and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life .
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime
is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility --
about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech .
As you can see , it has world class art , and it &apos;s all my taste
I said to my boy , &quot; When you raise the money ,
In my view , it is this kind of world
and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto , Japan ,
and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building .
We have since spun him off into his own business .
He &apos;s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people .
And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school
because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers
and single parents deserved to come to a school
where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day .
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people
We even have flowers in the hallway , and they &apos;re not plastic .
Those are real and they &apos;re in my building every day .
we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me ,
what an extraordinary story and what a great school .
and we were curious as to how the flowers got there . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse
and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there . &quot;
You don &apos;t need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids .
What you need to know is that the children
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge .
And so in my building , which is full of sunlight and full of flowers ,
And so the next thing you &apos;ll see is a million dollar kitchen
that was built by the Heinz company -- you &apos;ve heard of them ?
And I happen to know that company pretty well
because John Heinz , who was our U.S. senator --
who was tragically killed in a plane accident --
he had heard about my desire to build a new building ,
because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag
and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site .
which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz
and John Heinz had 600 million dollars , and at the time I had about 60 cents .
We &apos;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers ,
and we &apos;re inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building .
if you would add a culinary program to your program . &quot;
Because back then , we were building a trades program .
He said , &quot; That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals
I said , &quot; Senator , I &apos;m reluctant to go into a field
that I don &apos;t know much about , but I promise you
that if you &apos;ll support my school , I &apos;ll get it built
and in a couple of years , I &apos;ll come back
And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said ,
if I said I &apos;d give you a million dollars ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Senator , it appears that we &apos;re going into the food training business . &quot;
And John Heinz did give me a million bucks .
he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company .
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America ,
which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools ,
and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers
in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .
I would like to show you now some of the food
that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen .
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food .
and there &apos;s no excuse why we all can &apos;t be eating it .
So at my school , we subsidize a gourmet lunch program
for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city
because we &apos;ve discovered that it &apos;s good for their stomachs ,
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life
that they have value at this place I call my center .
We have students who sit together , black kids and white kids ,
and what we &apos;ve discovered is you can solve the race problem
because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior
These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing
What we &apos;ve discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people
is they don &apos;t have any money , which happens to be a curable condition .
It &apos;s all in the way that you think about people
That was done by a student after seven months in the program ,
I &apos;ve actually eaten seven of those baskets and they &apos;re very good .
But this is my view of how students ought to be treated ,
like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon .
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh --
What we &apos;ve discovered is you have to give them flowers
and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie &apos;s music ,
and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry .
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago --
And I have children with high school diplomas that they can &apos;t read .
who can &apos;t read the diplomas that they have in their hands ?
for the kids they spit out the other end , not the children who read .
I can take these children and in 20 weeks ,
demonstrated aptitude ; I can get them high school equivalent .
And this is the arts program I started in 1968 .
Remember I &apos;m the black kid from the &apos; 60s who got his life saved with ceramics .
Well , I went out and decided to reproduce my experience
the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system
that come to me every day of the week for arts education .
And these are children who are flunking out of public school .
And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college
and I &apos;ve averaged over 80 percent for 15 years .
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education .
because I figured that if you treat children like human beings ,
it increases the likelihood they &apos;re going to behave that way .
in every school and in every city and every town
And these are all kids with no artistic ability , no talent ,
no imagination . And we bring in the world &apos;s greatest artists --
is that the children will become like the people who teach them .
In fact , I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican ,
and let me show you what they did with the work .
These were children who the whole world had given up on ,
with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
And these are examples of some of the kids &apos; work .
because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery ,
and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come .
so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time .
And I said , &quot; Bill , I want to hire you , man .
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit ,
I can &apos;t get these parents to come to the school . &quot;
He said , &quot; I &apos;ll get them to come to the school . &quot;
So , he jumped in the van , he went to Miss Jones &apos; house and said ,
&quot; Miss Jones , I knew you wanted to come to your kid &apos;s art opening
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents .
At the last show that we did , 200 parents showed up
Because now it &apos;s become socially not acceptable not to show up
to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen &apos;s Guild
Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated ,
I wanted you to see this gallery because it &apos;s as good as it gets .
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school ,
before they apply to college because it &apos;s all up here .
You have to change the way that people see themselves
And it &apos;s worked out pretty good up to this day .
I even stuck another room on the building , which I &apos;d like to show you .
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference .
I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , what do you do for a living ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Well , I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard . &quot;
And I said , &quot; You &apos;re in the computer business , is that right ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , there &apos;s an easy solution to that problem . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m very pleased to announce to you that HP
have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology
and all their furniture for the United States of America .
We got it just done in time to show you ,
so it &apos;s kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center .
and this is where the story gets kind of interesting .
So , I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes
and you &apos;ll understand why he &apos;s there and I &apos;m here .
In 1986 , I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall
on the north end of the building while I was building it .
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there
because he knew this man over here , Marty Ashby .
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check
&quot; Dizzy , why would you come to a black-run center
in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate
He said , &quot; Because I heard you built the center
and I didn &apos;t believe that you did it , and I wanted to see for myself .
And now that I have , I want to give you a gift . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to allow you to record the concert
and if you ever choose to sell it , you must sign an agreement
that says the money will come back and support the school . &quot;
And I recorded Dizzy . And he died a year later ,
but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing .
&quot; Dizzy talking about you all over the country , man ,
And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up .
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park
to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city .
And I &apos;m very pleased to tell you that , with their permission ,
but not before his last recording was done at my school .
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder
and he said , &quot; God &apos;s picked you , man , to do this work .
And I want my music to be with you . &quot;
When the Basie band came , the band got so excited about the school
they voted to give me the rights to the music .
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy .
And like a fool , I didn &apos;t go to the ceremony
because I didn &apos;t think we were going to win .
and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden .
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them
and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back .
So , we &apos;ve become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios
in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
If you &apos;d have dropped a bomb on that room ,
you &apos;d have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania
Including my mother and father , who lived long enough
And there &apos;s Dizzy , just like I told you . He was there .
And that was our first recording studio , which was the broom closet .
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing
And this is our new facility , which is all video technology .
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson ,
who recorded that album at our school last Christmas .
And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey
on Christmas Day , he was there and Nancy was there
the rights to which she donated to our school .
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty
that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs .
We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts ,
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building --
and I walked back out in the streets again .
And I &apos;m very pleased to tell you that the building &apos;s done .
It &apos;s also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot --
triple that in the middle of the inner city .
And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants
and we now train medical technicians through all their system .
And I love them because they pay the rent on time .
I &apos;m now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation
And this is in the process of being built as we speak .
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse
growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city .
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers
to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states .
And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu , California ,
So , the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership
to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city .
that if he could find some funding for this ,
we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal ,
And we got the funding and we open in the fall .
And you ought to come and see it -- it &apos;s going to be a hell of a story .
And this is what I want to do when I grow up .
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at
and I &apos;ll tell you where I made my big mistake .
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park --
which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront --
for four million dollars and I didn &apos;t do it .
And I built the first building , and guess what happened ?
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody &apos;s expectations
and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year ,
you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams ,
I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit ,
and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m very flattered . What do you do for a living ? &quot;
He says , &quot; I run the city of San Francisco .
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise
and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night --
And he walked in and he says , &quot; What is this ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Herbie , this is my concept of a training center
I &apos;ve had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you &apos;ve built it .
I said , &quot; Well , where would you build this thing ? &quot;
As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown ,
and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago ,
and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth .
And Willie Brown said , &quot; As sure as I &apos;m the mayor of San Francisco ,
as a legacy to the poor people of this city . &quot;
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay
and we got an architect and we got a general contractor
and our friends from HP , and our friends from Steelcase ,
and our friends from Cisco , and our friends from Wells Fargo
And along the way , I met this real short guy
And I said , &quot; Well , thank you very much for that .
He said , &quot; Well , I built a company called eBay . &quot;
Thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we &apos;ll talk . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano ,
but I had the presence of mind to go back
and talk to one of the techie kids at my center .
I said , &quot; Well , I met the guy who built the thing
So , I called him up on the phone and I said , &quot; Mr. Skoll ,
I &apos;ve come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are
And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point ,
and I said , &quot; The mayor sent me down here to work with you
and I want to build a center with you ,
but I &apos;m not going to build you anything if you don &apos;t want it .
And all I &apos;ve got is a box of slides . &quot;
And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry , very disappointed people
on a summer night , and the air conditioner had broken
And after about 10 pictures they all settled down .
And I ran the story and I said , &quot; What do you think ? &quot;
And in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said ,
&quot; In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place ,
you &apos;re the only person that &apos;s come down here and treated us with dignity .
And she turned that audience around on a pin .
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing ,
And I think we can get in the ground this year
as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh .
But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way
And Quincy said , &quot; I want to help you , man .
as I have with Herbie and with his music .
And Quincy said , &quot; Where did the idea for centers like this come from ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; It came from your music , man .
Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums
when I was 16 years old in the pottery class ,
And I said , &quot; If I can follow that music ,
I &apos;ll get out into the sunlight and I &apos;ll be OK .
And if that &apos;s not true , how did I get here ? &quot;
that I think the world is a place that &apos;s worth living .
going into town after town with people standing around on corners
with holes where eyes used to be , their spirits damaged .
We won &apos;t make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around .
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail ,
It &apos;s 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School .
It &apos;s 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail .
and very decent people who still believe in something .
And I want to do this in my lifetime , in every city and in every town .
I think we can get home on this thing
and I think we can build these all over the country
And I believe we can turn this whole story around
to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work .
And so I &apos;ve figured out , over time , the solution to the depression :
you make a friend in every town and you &apos;ll never be lonely .
And my hope is that I &apos;ve made a few here tonight .
And thanks for listening to what I had to say .
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
So they are one cell and they have this special property
and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out .
they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle ,
and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
They just grow and divide , and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life ,
except that what I would argue is that you have
I know you guys think of yourself as humans , and this is sort of how I think of you .
and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us
who we are and able to do all the things that we do ,
in you or on you at any moment in your life .
so here &apos;s all the A , T , Gs and Cs
that make up your genetic code , and give you all your charming characteristics .
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes
playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
I know you think of yourself as human beings ,
but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial .
that help us and are vital for keeping us alive ,
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of
So , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the Earth
that have no business being in you or on you at any time ,
and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
And so , the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the
good things that bacteria do , or all the bad things that bacteria do .
The question we had is how could they do anything at all ?
you have to have a microscope to see one .
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide ,
and they &apos;ve always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms .
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact
And so we wanted to think if there couldn &apos;t be a different
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium ,
What you &apos;re looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab
holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,
a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean ,
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light ,
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room ,
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone ,
so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
But when they grew to a certain cell number
The question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms ,
What we &apos;ve figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other ,
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules
and these are the red triangles , and when the bacteria is alone
the molecules just float away and so no light .
the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule
that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are ,
and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony .
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .
Again , another plug for the animals in the ocean ,
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid ,
and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans
is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii ,
but then at night it has to come out to hunt .
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight
that light can penetrate the depth of the water
the squid lives in , since it &apos;s just in those couple feet of water .
that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria .
so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back .
so the amount of light coming out of the bottom --
exactly matches how much light hits the squid &apos;s back ,
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
But then if you think about it , the squid has this terrible problem
because it &apos;s got this dying , thick culture of bacteria
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up
the squid goes back to sleep , it buries itself in the sand ,
and it &apos;s got a pump that &apos;s attached to its circadian rhythm ,
and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria .
Now the bacteria are dilute , that little hormone molecule is gone ,
but of course the squid doesn &apos;t care . It &apos;s asleep in the sand .
And as the day goes by the bacteria double ,
they release the molecule , and then light comes on
First we figured out how this bacterium does this ,
but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be , again , my bacterial cell --
that &apos;s the red box -- it &apos;s an enzyme that makes
And then as the cells grow , they &apos;re all releasing that molecule
into the environment , so there &apos;s lots of molecule there .
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface
that fits like a lock and key with that molecule .
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .
When the molecule increases to a certain amount --
which says something about the number of cells --
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade
we have found that this is not just some anomaly
of this ridiculous , glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean --
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
We have a fancy name for this : we call it quorum sensing .
the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote .
is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors
But the one that &apos;s probably the most important to you is virulence .
It &apos;s not like a couple bacteria get in you
you &apos;re enormous , that would have no effect on you . You &apos;re huge .
is they get in you , they wait , they start growing ,
and they recognize when they have the right cell number
that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together ,
they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host .
We also then went to look at what are these molecules --
these were the red triangles on my slides before .
So then we started to look at other bacteria ,
and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we &apos;ve discovered .
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that &apos;s its language
we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors .
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time
bacteria don &apos;t live by themselves , they live in incredible mixtures ,
with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria .
And that &apos;s depicted on this slide . This is your skin .
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin .
Anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this ,
and what I hope you can see is that there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria there .
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria ,
it &apos;s not enough to be able to only talk within your species .
There has to be a way to take a census
of the rest of the bacteria in the population .
But then , running in parallel to that is a second system
So , they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal
and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria .
What happens is that bacteria are able to count
how many of me and how many of you .
depending on who &apos;s in the minority and who &apos;s in the majority
and we figured out what this generic molecule is --
that was the pink ovals on my last slide , this is it .
is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme
Once we got that far , we started to learn
that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language .
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something
I &apos;ve told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors ,
Of course , I &apos;ve also told you that one of the important things they do
Of course , you &apos;ve just heard and you already know
and that &apos;s because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria .
they make the bacterium so it can &apos;t replicate its DNA .
And so now of course we have this global problem
We thought , well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications ,
just make these bacteria so they can &apos;t talk , they can &apos;t count ,
And so that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve sort of taken two strategies .
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules --
which you saw -- but they &apos;re a little bit different .
what we are able to do is to make
We &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
We &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics
In this one I &apos;m just using the interspecies molecule ,
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal ,
It gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting
What we &apos;ve been able to do is to give these virulent infections ,
but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules --
so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing ,
but they &apos;re a little bit different which I &apos;ve depicted on this slide .
What we now know is that if we treat the animal
with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --
in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule ,
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics
and it &apos;s going to get us around , at least initially ,
What I hope you think , is that bacteria can talk to each other ,
So in the spirit of TED they &apos;re doing things together
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors ,
What I would hope that I could further argue to you
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years ;
we &apos;re going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .
if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms ,
to other human diseases and human behaviors as well .
By using these two molecules they can say &quot; me &quot; and they can say &quot; you . &quot;
It &apos;s not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day ,
and that &apos;s because there &apos;s all of this chemistry going on ,
these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is ,
and you &apos;ve just evolved a few more bells and whistles ,
but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study .
The final thing is , again just to reiterate that there &apos;s this practical part ,
that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
But then , to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria
So , we &apos;ve targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells
What we &apos;re also trying to do is to beef up the conversation
of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you ,
so bacteria can do things that we want them to do
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture .
I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper
or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old ,
and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country .
I keep getting older and older and they &apos;re always the same age ,
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
It &apos;s a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
I want to tell you how we found that out .
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago ,
it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
is it &apos;s very , very complex on the Windows part , the dropper part ,
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese ,
and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infect
because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
So we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs --
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
And I want to tell you how we were able
So what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls ,
And then we were looking for timers and data structures
and trying to relate them to the real world --
because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported .
Now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
&quot; Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base . &quot;
And I phoned them up and picked their brain
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge ,
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor ,
was really to do it slowly and creepy --
that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this
And guess what we found in the attack code ?
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
And we often went into just a dead end
were actually aiming at one and the same target ,
and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down ,
that we have actually determined what the target is .
Here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw --
is it intercepts the input values from sensors --
And as a matter of fact , this fake input data
not only to fool the operators in the control room .
where a human operator could not act quick enough .
when your big steam turbine gets too over speed ,
Obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
So this is where we need digital safety systems .
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
And this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say .
And you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker --
as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet .
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
They &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
Ralph Langner : Okay , you really want to hear that ?
CA : Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . Thank you , Ralph .
Look at all the arguments we have these days
Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery .
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?
if the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is played
Aristotle doesn &apos;t agree with you that that &apos;s the reason .
for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
is the essential nature of the activity in question
that the best flute players should get the best flutes
is not only to make the rest of us happy ,
Now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes
that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
All right , let &apos;s take a poll , show of hands .
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
All right , we have a good division of opinion here .
grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart ,
Raise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a microphone .
if he gets to ride in a golf cart .
I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart
We &apos;ll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply .
why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ?
MS : But what about walking from hole to hole ?
Charlie : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?
Audience : The endurance element is a very important part of the game ,
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
Well , I should tell you about the Supreme Court first .
that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart .
said he had read all about the history of golf ,
is to get very small ball from one place
But since it is the very nature of a game
First , no real sports fan would talk that way .
we wouldn &apos;t care about the outcome of the game .
it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --
But if fairness were the only thing at stake ,
there would have been an easy and obvious solution .
that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
And I think we can do that in public life more generally .
and to see whether we can partner with institutions ,
you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions ,
but with people from China and India joining in ?
MS : Right . We did a little bit of it here
and we do it in a classroom at Harvard
that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor .
so I &apos;m going to dive straight in , right at the point
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we have to get our shit together ,
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .
I &apos;m going to talk about feasibility as well , of course .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we are so fatalistic
And then I &apos;m going spend perhaps the second half of the talk
talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong ,
The first one I &apos;m going to talk about is
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --
which I &apos;m going to define as 30 years , applied to people
who are already in middle-age when you start --
to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging .
how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --
or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
And of course , the last thing I &apos;m going to talk about
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?
who &apos;s not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
That &apos;s very good news , because I thought that was what the answer would be .
Now the thing is , I would like to put it to you
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing
is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does .
Now , I like in an audience , in Britain especially ,
which is something that was banned after a long struggle ,
I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sympathetic audience here ,
but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic .
And this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me .
You know , a lot of people said , &quot; Well , you know ,
city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
It &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life ,
and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
It &apos;s ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . &quot;
came to the conclusion that it was really something
that should not be tolerated in a civilized society .
getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun ,
So really , this is how I would like to describe it .
There are some good points to be made here ,
things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning
so that nothing goes too -- well , so that we minimize
the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .
You know , these are arguments ; these are things that
But the question is , are they so dangerous --
that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,
condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
You know , if you haven &apos;t got an argument that &apos;s that strong ,
then just don &apos;t waste my time , is what I say .
that some people do think really is that strong , and here it is .
&quot; Well , if we fix aging , no one &apos;s going to die to speak of ,
or at least the death toll is going to be much lower ,
And therefore , we &apos;re not going to be able to have many kids ,
And you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question ,
I don &apos;t agree with those answers . I think they basically don &apos;t work .
I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a dilemma in this respect .
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate ,
A high death rate will , of course , arise from simply rejecting these therapies ,
in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids .
the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --
who would have been young enough and healthy enough
to benefit from those therapies , but will not be ,
because we haven &apos;t developed them as quickly as we could --
we &apos;ll be denying those people an indefinite life span ,
now why should we get a little bit more active on this ?
the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .
Aging is ghastly , but it &apos;s inevitable , so , you know ,
we &apos;ve got to find some way to put it out of our minds ,
and it &apos;s rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that .
why aging is actually a good thing after all .
But of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --
and we might be in range of doing something about aging --
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .
And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot --
evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot --
in order to get people &apos;s attention , and make people realize
that they are in a trance in this regard .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is inevitable
is summed up in a definition of aging that I &apos;m giving here .
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place ,
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars ,
despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms ,
basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next ,
That &apos;s a fine definition . So we can put it this way :
we can say that , you know , we have this chain of events .
according to most people , with regard to postponing aging .
They &apos;re what I &apos;m calling here the &quot; gerontology approach &quot; and the &quot; geriatrics approach . &quot;
and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time ,
Of course , it &apos;s a very short-term-ist strategy ; it &apos;s a losing battle ,
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface ,
But unfortunately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand metabolism very well .
In fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --
even cells we &apos;re not really too good on yet .
and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
Basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end ,
but it is not an approach whose time has come
I mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing ,
Before I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit
Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire --
let &apos;s say we do it today for the sake of argument --
the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life
on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 55 .
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; robust human rejuvenation . &quot; OK .
for how long people of various ages today --
or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --
In order to answer that question -- you might think it &apos;s simple ,
We can &apos;t just say , &quot; Well , if they &apos;re young enough to benefit from these therapies ,
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
very hard to predict how long it &apos;s going to take
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun ,
and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened
in the progression of the technology of powered flight .
We can think , really , that each one is sort of
beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
Computers : you can look at a more or less parallel time line ,
You can look at medical care . I mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics --
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago ,
That in fact , the people who are young enough
even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive ,
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments
that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years .
In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game .
the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more ,
they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades
that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
I &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies
They &apos;ll never be perfect , but we &apos;ll be able to fix the things
that 200-year-olds die of , before we have any 200-year-olds .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
So , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live ,
for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
If you &apos;re already 100 , or even if you &apos;re 80 --
we probably can &apos;t do a lot for you with these therapies ,
for the really initial , experimental therapies to be good enough for you .
But if you &apos;re only 50 , then there &apos;s a chance
that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know --
and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,
in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental ,
and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .
And of course , if you &apos;re a bit younger than that ,
to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to , that the first 150-year-old --
we don &apos;t know how old that person is today ,
because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take
I &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --
subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes --
is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
Alright , so finally I &apos;m going to spend the rest of the talk ,
namely , how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension
that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?
And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
I &apos;m calling it &quot; robust mouse rejuvenation , &quot; not very imaginatively .
I say we &apos;re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse ,
which basically means mice that live about three years on average .
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them ,
and with those therapies , we get them to live ,
So , in other words , we add two years --
starting from the point that we started the therapies .
The question then is , what would that actually mean for the time frame
until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans ?
equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity .
Secondly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception
of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things ,
And thirdly , the question is , what will it do
And it seems to me that the first question
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation ,
that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame ,
in order to give people a sense of proportion
So , I say that we have a 50 / 50 chance
robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much .
And finally , of course , I think it &apos;s fair to say
that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now
is the global trance I spoke about earlier , the coping strategy .
because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans ,
since it &apos;s been postponed so very effectively in mice .
So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very strong change in people &apos;s attitudes ,
So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these mice ,
I &apos;m going to add a little bit to my description of aging .
to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism
is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology ,
the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life , starting before we &apos;re born .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
We can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics
And I &apos;m going to explain exactly what damage is
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time
So there &apos;s a third approach , if we look at it this way .
and I claim that the engineering approach is within range .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a losing battle ,
and it &apos;s something that we are within range of being able to do ,
&quot; Let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --
not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot ,
so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold
that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
because we don &apos;t get age-related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age ,
even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .
Why do I say that we &apos;re in range ? Well , this is basically it .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging ,
we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism
is important for aging in one way or another .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
It &apos;s a list of types of pathology that are age-related ,
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --
this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage ,
side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end ,
They &apos;re categories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them .
Cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on .
First of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
One can say , &quot; OK , what are we made of ? &quot;
because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed --
like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too .
So , these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago
and that is pretty good news , because it means that ,
you know , we &apos;ve come a long way in biology in these 20 years ,
so the fact that we haven &apos;t extended this list
is a pretty good indication that there &apos;s no extension to be done .
However , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all ,
in mice , in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is ,
we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
I haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but
my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this ,
then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years ,
but we do need to get serious about it .
So of course , there are some biologists in the audience ,
and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based ,
of my rather aggressive time frames that I &apos;m predicting here .
you &apos;d better damn well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong .
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people
as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field ,
you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant
So , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework ,
One thing is , you know , you &apos;ll be hearing from a guy in the next session
who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time ,
We have various strategies -- there &apos;s the Methuselah Mouse Prize ,
and to do what you think is going to work ,
and you get money for it if you win .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
But , I mean , look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?
It &apos;s got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech ,
but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chance , I think , of succeeding in this .
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Chris Anderson : OK . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions
but I thought I would give people the chance .
Audience : Since you &apos;ve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it ,
why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ?
AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158 .
Audience : Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems
to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
However , as far as I know , all the species have evolved to actually die ,
so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die .
So , why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality ,
when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ?
I &apos;m going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question ,
which is that , no , aging is not a product of selection , evolution ;
In other words , we have aging because it &apos;s hard work not to have aging ;
you need more genetic pathways , more sophistication in your genes
and that carries on being true the longer you push it out .
doesn &apos;t care whether genes are passed on by individuals ,
Audience : Hello . I read somewhere that in the last 20 years ,
the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
If I project that , that would make me think
that I would live until 120 if I don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
That means that I &apos;m one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old ?
have been growing at between one and two years per decade .
So , it &apos;s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
Audience : I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years ,
as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ?
Basically what we need to do is replace cells
in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate ,
especially neurons , but we don &apos;t want to replace them
any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway ,
because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function .
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --
but they do it by not having a nervous system --
and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland ,
that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay .
of almost all of you and many of your friends ,
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of Audur Capital ,
and Kristin -- who you see in the picture --
just over a year before the economic collapse hit .
But I can surely tell you that in my country ,
much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere ,
So we decided , a bit fed-up with this world
and also with the strong feeling in our stomach
So it was almost like coming out of the closet
to actually talk about the fact that we were women
and that we believed that we had a set of values
And we got a great group of people to join us --
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland
and also there &apos;s a factor of luck and timing --
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you &apos;re taking ,
and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter ,
And , although we do work in the financial sector ,
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers ,
we are willing to do it with a long-term view ,
and we like to have a wider definition of profits
than just the economic profit in the next quarter .
It &apos;s the female trend , and it &apos;s the sustainability trend ,
bringing different values and different ways to the table .
So what do you get ? You get better decision-making ,
and both of those things hit your bottom line
now that we &apos;ve had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --
and by the way , Europe looks pretty bad right now ,
telling us that it &apos;s much better to have diversity
Well I &apos;ll give you my straight talk about this .
but I have days that I &apos;m full of doubt .
of doing the same things over and over again ,
hoping that this time it &apos;s not going to collapse upon us .
and they are going to start voting with their wallets ,
I first realized that women matter to the economy
I was seven -- it happened to be my mother &apos;s birthday --
From work or from home , they took the day off ,
And some say this was the start of a global movement .
For me it was the start of a long journey ,
allude to the fact that she couldn &apos;t become president --
she was a woman , and even half a woman .
&quot; Well , I &apos;m actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation ;
that have influenced who I am and where I am today .
I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career
that women and men would have just the same opportunities .
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .
The final thought I want to leave with you
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
That &apos;s how we change the world . That &apos;s the only sustainable future .
to speak at the end of a conference like this ,
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us
of some of the things that have gone on here ,
and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away ,
We came here saying we want to talk about &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter . &quot;
But we are talking about &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter &quot;
because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we &apos;re looking at ,
The picture I showed you before , and this picture , of drought , death and disease
What we want to look at is &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter , &quot;
And I think it &apos;s worth remembering what we &apos;ve heard
where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
So I &apos;m not going to spend too much time --
that we are here for &quot; Africa : the Next Chapter &quot; because for the first time
that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen .
After decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent ,
and it &apos;s going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about
because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --
from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion .
You know , we &apos;ve built up reserves . Why is that important ?
It &apos;s because it shows off our economies , shows off our currencies
and gives a platform on which people can plan and build , including businesses .
We &apos;ve also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference
from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
In 2005 , remittances -- I just took one country , Nigeria
if your people in the diaspora bring their money back ,
And instead of an outflow , you are now getting a net inflow .
Now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
that we have the president , Kikwete , and others of our leaders who are saying ,
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24 .
This means that we have to focus on how our youth
are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives .
You have to focus on how to create jobs ,
make sure they don &apos;t fall into disease , and that they get an education .
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life ,
and that they are creating the kind of productive environment
one of the things I &apos;ve done since leaving government
is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria .
Most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
There is no way you can know what people want .
One of the things we asked them recently was what &apos;s their top issue .
Like in every other country where this has been done ,
I want to leave this up here and come back to it .
But before I get to this slide , I just wanted to run you through this .
And to say that for me , the next stage of building this platform
we couldn &apos;t even talk about the next chapter , because we were in the old chapter .
So let &apos;s not forget that it &apos;s taken a lot to build this ,
including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to .
Creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption ,
So now we have this platform we can build on .
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here :
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things
And that &apos;s not what the debate should be about .
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors ,
To move our continent forward , to do the things that need doing
that I talked about -- getting young people employed .
So I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate .
I don &apos;t think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that
he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid .
And I said , &quot; Mo , you &apos;re right . We have -- no , but we &apos;ve already been doing it !
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa &apos;s aid . &quot;
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa ,
So when they try to give back , we shouldn &apos;t be on the defensive .
The issue is how are we using what has been given back .
Why I don &apos;t mind if we get aid , but we use it well .
From 1967 to &apos; 70 , Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war .
And in the middle of that war , I was 14 years old .
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking .
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army .
And we were down to eating one meal a day , running from place to place ,
At a certain point in time , in 1969 , things were really bad .
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day .
I &apos;m sure some of you who are not so young
In the midst of all this , my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days .
So I was the oldest person in the house .
She was three years old and I was 15 .
And she had such a high fever . We tried everything .
It didn &apos;t look like it was going to work .
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --
and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back .
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman .
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people .
I walked 10 kilometers , putting one foot in front of the other .
Almost a thousand people were there , trying to break down the door .
She was doing this in a church . How was I going to get in ?
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people
And while they were trying to break down the door ,
I climbed in through the window , and jumped in .
This woman told me it was in the nick of time .
By the time we jumped into that hall , she was barely moving .
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --
gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --
and some other therapies , and put us in a corner .
In about two to three hours , she started to move .
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating ,
And about five or six hours later , she said we could go home .
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had .
I was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive !
Today she &apos;s 41 years old , a mother of three ,
Why am I telling that ? I &apos;m telling you that because --
when it is you or your person involved --
And now let me become less sentimental , and say that saving lives --
which some of the aid we get does on this continent --
when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother ,
And as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
These are people who are productive agents in the economy .
So if we save people from HIV / AIDS , if we save them from malaria ,
it means they can form the base of production for our economy .
as someone said yesterday -- if we don &apos;t and they die ,
their children will become a burden on the economy .
So that &apos;s one of the reasons , from a personal experience , that I say
let &apos;s channel these resources we get into something productive .
However , I will also tell you that I &apos;m one of those
who doesn &apos;t believe that this is the sole answer .
That &apos;s why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated .
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --
got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU ?
The EU transferred 10 billion . Where did they use it ?
Have you been to southern Spain lately ? There are roads everywhere .
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid ?
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today .
For which many people , even from other parts of the world ,
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid ?
They didn &apos;t say , &quot; No , you know , we &apos;re not going to take this . &quot;
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --
which is roads , highways , other things that they can build --
I say then , why do they refuse to use the same aid
When we ask them and tell them what we need ,
one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now .
Now we talk about the World Bank , IMF , and accountability , all that
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --
some of them in this audience , with private foundations .
And one day , these foundations have so much money ,
they will overtake the official aid that is being given .
But I fear -- and I &apos;m very grateful to all of them
for what they are trying to do on the continent --
but I &apos;m also worried . I wake up with a gnawing in my belly
because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent .
and many times trying to find what to do .
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent .
And many times I don &apos;t see Africans working with them .
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested
see what &apos;s happening on the ground and make a decision .
But I worry because this money is so important .
Are we on their boards when they make decisions
Will we make the same mistake that we made before ?
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --
have they ever called these people together and said ,
Let &apos;s sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled
And each one is making their own individual effort .
And then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into Africa ,
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money ,
And we don &apos;t do it because there are so many of us . We don &apos;t coordinate .
We &apos;ve not called the Bill Gates , and the Soros ,
Here is where we want you to channel this money . &quot;
We &apos;re not trying to stop them at all ! But to help them help us better .
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this .
Ten years from now we will have the same story ,
So our problem right now is , how can we leverage
all this good will that is coming towards our way ?
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too .
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work .
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas .
So why don &apos;t we think of using some of this aid ?
Well , why don &apos;t we first say to those helping us out ,
That health that you &apos;re working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure .
if we &apos;ve got electricity and railroads , and so on .
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .
And then we can see that this is one combination
private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership ,
Aid cannot solve our problems , I &apos;m firmly convinced about that .
But it can be catalytic . And if we fail to use it as catalytic ,
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --
one of the reasons is not only just that , you know , these people are stupid
It &apos;s because there &apos;s a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese .
If you tell them , &quot; We need a road here , &quot;
In fact , the Chinese minister of finance said to me ,
when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria .
He said , &quot; There are two things you need only .
It &apos;s the same . We need infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline .
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that .
Now I realize -- I &apos;m not saying -- health and education --
Let &apos;s see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership .
people are afraid to take risks on the continent .
Why can &apos;t some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms ,
And finally , because they are both standing at my -- I &apos;m out of time .
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is
A lot has been said here about women , I don &apos;t need to repeat it .
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --
the World Bank Review , done in 2000 , showing that
in healthier children , more for the household , more for the economy and all that .
So I &apos;m saying that one of the takeaways from here --
I &apos;m not saying the men are not important --
obviously , if you leave the husbands out , what will they do ?
and it will result in difficulties we don &apos;t want .
because they don &apos;t have a job , and so on .
But at the margin , we also -- I want to push this ,
they get -- not automatically , but they tend to get more support .
in the hands of African women is a powerful tool .
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda .
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria , with the chair company .
So take away from here is how are you going to put together
the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle
business people who want to expand and create more jobs .
to be part of this partnership of aid , government , private sector
and I have never had a patient tell me
that &quot; I really want you to be creative during surgery , &quot;
and so I guess there &apos;s a little bit of irony to it .
I will say though that , after having done surgery a lot ,
And for me , this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound
is what led me to both be a surgeon
and also to study the science of sound , particularly music .
And so I &apos;m going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes
in terms of how I &apos;m able to actually try to study music
and really try to grapple with all these questions
of how the brain is able to be creative .
I &apos;ve done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University ,
but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously .
I &apos;m going to start off by playing a video for you .
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett , who &apos;s a well-known jazz improviser
of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level .
and he &apos;ll never play it exactly the same way again ,
And so why don &apos;t we go and click the video .
It &apos;s really a remarkable , awesome thing that happens there .
I &apos;ve always -- just as a listener , as just a fan --
And so I set out with this concept , scientifically ,
that artistic creativity , it &apos;s magical , but it &apos;s not magic ,
I took this thesis that we could study it
just like we study any other complex neurologic process .
And I think there &apos;s some sub-questions there that I put there .
And I &apos;ll tell you that most scientific studies of music ,
and when you actually go through them , it &apos;s very hard to recognize the music in it .
In fact , they seem to be very unmusical entirely
and to miss the whole point of the music .
Maybe we &apos;re not the right people to do it .
but I will say that , from a scientific perspective --
how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate
and truly , we know very little about how we are able to be creative .
And so I think that we &apos;re going to see
a real science of creativity that &apos;s burgeoning and is going to flourish .
Because we now have new methods that can enable us
And so all of us have this remarkable brain ,
and I myself , I &apos;m not going to give you many answers today ,
And fundamentally that &apos;s what I do in my lab .
I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this .
This is the main method that I use . This is called functional MRI .
If you &apos;ve been in an MRI scanner , it &apos;s very much the same ,
but this one is outfitted in a special way
but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain .
Now the way that &apos;s done is by the following .
When an area of the brain is active , meaning a neural area is active ,
and we &apos;re measuring blood flow , not neural activity --
we say that an area of the brain that &apos;s getting more blood
Now I &apos;m going to review a study that I did ,
And this was done with a colleague of mine , Alan Braun , at the NIH .
This is a short video of how we did this project .
Charles Limb : This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard
that is designed to fit both inside the scanner ,
and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players &apos; legs
while they &apos;re lying down in the scanner , playing on their back .
And it works like this -- this doesn &apos;t actually produce any sound .
It sends out what &apos;s called a MIDI signal --
through these wires into the box and then the computer ,
we now have the means to take a musical process and study it .
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard ?
You can &apos;t just sort of -- &quot; It &apos;s great we &apos;ve got this keyboard . &quot;
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
And so the experiment really rests on the following :
What happens in the brain during something that &apos;s memorized and over-learned ,
And so , I have here what we call the &quot; paradigms . &quot;
There &apos;s a scale paradigm , which is just playing a scale up and down , memorized .
And then there &apos;s the bottom one , which is called the jazz paradigm .
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH ,
and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left , the lower-left --
and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes .
And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon ,
that &apos;s an example of what was recorded in the scanner .
So in the end , it &apos;s not the most natural environment ,
And the musicians , they were comfortable in the end .
And so we first measured the number of notes .
Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising ?
I &apos;m going to try to condense this for you .
In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex ,
and in blue is this area that was deactivated .
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex
that went way down in activity , and I &apos;ll summarize that for you here .
As I like to say , these are not the &quot; jazz areas &quot; of the brain .
of an area that &apos;s thought to be involved in self-monitoring , turning off ,
And we think , at least in this preliminary --
you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe .
One area turns on , and a big area shuts off ,
so that you &apos;re not inhibited , so that you &apos;re willing to make mistakes ,
Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity --
What happens when musicians are trading back and forth ,
which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment ?
And I &apos;ve broken it down into four-bar groups here ,
Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner -- same way --
and then had another musician out in the control room
one of the world &apos;s best bassists and a fantastic piano player .
CL : Mike , come on in . Mike Pope : May the force be with you .
CL : You have to have the right attitude to agree to it .
He &apos;s in there . You can see his legs up there .
And then I &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
The fact that we do it over and over again
So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing ,
and not able to move at all except for my hand .
CL : At this point , I &apos;ll take a few moments .
When he was trading fours with me , improvising versus memorized ,
He actually had it also homologous on the right .
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .
This whole notion that music is a language --
well maybe there &apos;s a neurologic basis to it in fact after all ,
and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation .
And so we &apos;ve done this actually on eight subjects now ,
so hopefully we &apos;ll have something to say about it meaningfully .
Now when I think about improvisation and the language , well what &apos;s next ?
And let &apos;s go ahead and play this video here .
Mos Def : ? ... brown skin I be , standing five-ten I be ?
between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz .
There are , in fact , a lot of correlations between the two forms of music
In a lot a ways , rap serves the same social function
And so this is what you do : you have a free-style artist
come in and memorize a rap that you write for them ,
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED ,
With this big screen , you can all rap with me . Okay ?
This is the control condition . This is what they memorized .
? The climb is sublime when I &apos;m on the mic ?
? My passion &apos;s not fashion , you can see how I &apos;m dressed ?
? I need a mad scientist to check my brain ?
They don &apos;t know what &apos;s coming , but they &apos;ll hear something off the cuff .
They are going to be cued these three square words : &quot; like , &quot; &quot; not &quot; and &quot; head . &quot;
Free-styler : ? I &apos;m like some kind of &#91; unclear &#93; ?
CL : So again , it &apos;s an incredible thing that &apos;s taking place .
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
This is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner .
CL : That was recorded in the scanner , by the way .
? Climb is sublime when I &apos;m on the mic ?
? I &apos;m passing on fashion ; you can see how I &apos;m dressed ?
CL : Okay . So I &apos;m going to stop that there . So what do we see in his brain ?
And what we see , we do see language areas lighting up ,
You &apos;ve got major cerebellar activity , which is involved in motor coordination .
You have heightened brain activity when you &apos;re doing a comparable task ,
when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .
It &apos;s very preliminary , but I think it &apos;s kind of cool .
So just to conclude , we &apos;ve got a lot of questions to ask ,
and like I said , we &apos;ll ask questions here , not answer them .
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius , neurologically ,
and I think , with these methods , we &apos;re getting close to being there .
And I think hopefully in the next 10 , 20 years
that say science has to catch up to art ,
And so I want to thank you for your time . I appreciate it .
we have always had to give a command to a machine ,
in order for it to do something for us .
is far more complex and a lot more interesting
and to increase the area that &apos;s available for mental capacity ,
may come from the same functional part of the brain ,
and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
like the one that you can see here in the photo .
and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp
actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars .
Evan Grant , who is one of last year &apos;s speakers ,
It only takes a few minutes to put on
so it gives you the freedom to move around .
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars
are actually designed to work out of the box
He &apos;s obviously not Joanne -- so we &apos;ll &quot; add user . &quot;
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite
and there &apos;s a progress bar that will scroll across the screen
because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; pull . &quot;
So we have a little bit of time available ,
because it &apos;s all about being able to visualize something
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions ,
we do that all the time , so you can visualize it .
is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
Same sort of drill . So : one , two , three , go .
TL : But we can see that it actually works ,
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this --
there is a leveling system built into this software
they can continue to add more and more detections ,
So I &apos;d like to show you a few examples ,
to heighten the experience that you &apos;re having , in real time .
You know , from the user interface of the control system
such as being able to control an electric wheelchair .
We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today ,
we hope that you can help us to shape
where the technology goes from here . Thank you so much .
And we do that for a couple of reasons .
invention is a lot of fun to do --
the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun ,
but we also have a program where we invent for humanity --
where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has ? &quot; --
and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems ,
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours
and he also funds this work , so thank you .
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines
and that &apos;s because they need to be kept cold .
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures .
and if you don &apos;t have stable power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen ,
It &apos;s not just the loss of the vaccine that matters ;
it &apos;s the fact that those kids don &apos;t get vaccinated .
These are Styrofoam chests . These are being carried by people ,
but they &apos;re also put on the backs of pickup trucks .
will last for about four hours with ice in it .
And we thought , well , that &apos;s not really good enough .
Now , the reason we were able to come up with this
One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar ,
something you &apos;d keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in .
Because if you open it up and reach inside ,
you &apos;d let the heat in , the game would be over .
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine .
which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed
Malaria is one of the great public health problems .
And there &apos;s no way for us here in this country
to grasp really what that means to the people involved .
Well , there are a lot of things people have tried
You can spray ; the problem is there are environmental issues .
You can try to treat people and create awareness .
That &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad ,
People have tried for a long time . There are a couple of interesting candidates .
It &apos;s a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for .
and bed nets are very effective if you use them .
You don &apos;t always use them for that . People fish with them .
but you &apos;re never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
but that &apos;s actually one of the things we find interesting about it
in the same way that a diabetic &apos;s glucose meter works :
you put it in there and it automatically tells you .
Today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure ,
it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood .
or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye ,
in fact , you may be able to do this
Because if you actually look through your fingernails , you can see blood vessels ,
and once you see blood vessels , we think we can see the malaria .
There &apos;s a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ;
where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are
take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .
we like to try to solve with some software .
One of the problems that you have if you &apos;re trying to eradicate malaria
is you don &apos;t know what &apos;s the most effective thing to do .
standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .
So that sets the stage on which you do this .
And this is this latter part of the rainy season .
because there &apos;s no place for the mosquitoes to breed .
And then , of course , the next year it comes roaring back .
before we actually have to do it in real life ;
to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs --
how many bed nets versus how much spraying ? --
we &apos;re going to see a view of the airflow .
we hope to understand how to make them not fly .
Now , one of the ways you can make them not fly
This is one of those things you just can &apos;t make up .
Once upon a time , this was the primary technique ,
and , in fact , many countries got rid of malaria through DDT .
&quot; Well , we &apos;ve done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium ,
Well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electronics . &quot;
has something interesting in it that maybe you could use .
that &apos;s used to steer a laser beam very accurately ;
that &apos;s what makes those little dots on the page .
So what if we could put all that together
to shoot them out of the sky with lasers ?
Now , in our company , this is what we call
Well , we could protect very high-value targets like clinics .
They &apos;re sick , and so they &apos;re less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes .
you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug
and you could listen to the wing beat frequency
Now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes .
in fact , in the lab , we feed ours raisins --
Nathan Myhrvold : Okay , so our legal department prepared a disclaimer ,
we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler
that &apos;s going to stay on the mosquito for , actually , quite a long period of time ;
is a tank on the other side of the stage .
can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around .
And Pablos , if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked
Next we can actually light them up with a laser .
and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency .
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around .
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around , being lit up .
so that you have an opportunity to see what &apos;s happening .
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate
that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this ,
and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it
highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world .
NM : So it wouldn &apos;t be any fun to show you that
without showing you what actually happens when we hit &apos; em .
This is one of the first ones we did .
We &apos;ll loop around here in just a second , and you &apos;ll see another one .
An interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ;
we &apos;ve never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair .
but the wing motor keeps all the way down .
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today ,
and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later , you &apos;re very welcome to .
and I &apos;ve spent a long time , 25 years , preparing these .
First of all , it &apos;s planted , and that takes energy .
and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it .
and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it .
There &apos;s a waste of time ; there &apos;s a waste of space ; there &apos;s a waste of energy ;
I &apos;m trying to lower each one of these elements .
Okay , so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like .
So let me run you through a few ideas .
This bench , although it was uncomfortable for my mom --
so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --
If they &apos;re not working , put a shelf on it , which I did ,
This is powered by wind . All of the lights are daylight bulbs .
which is very important when you &apos;re working in the room all the time .
I was experimenting with these -- I don &apos;t know if you can see it --
And I was thinking , well I &apos;m trying to think nature , nature , nature .
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there .
and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .
If you can see this orange tree , it &apos;s actually growing in a car tire ,
which has been turned inside out and sewn up .
It &apos;s got my compost in it , which is growing an orange tree , which is great .
This is the kitchen , which is in the same room .
they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted .
Okay , it &apos;s a small kitchen . It &apos;s about five square meters .
But this story &apos;s not about eliminating it , it &apos;s about minimizing it .
I put my food waste into this dehydrating , desiccating macerator --
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food ,
and it &apos;s growing in these tubs , which I made out of storm-felled trees
go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --
was a big wormery . I had a lot of worms in it .
putting it to the worms , going , &quot; There you go , dinner . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how many worms &#91; were &#93; in there ,
but I &apos;ve got some heavy karma coming , I tell you .
What you &apos;re seeing here is a water filtration system .
runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --
and I sort of water the garden with it .
And I ultimately want to recycle that , put it back into the loos ,
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant
that is consuming no gas to start with , that would be great .
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --
They &apos;re all English and a little bit more sustainable .
The whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen .
because I thought there was too much consumption going on there .
it &apos;s turning through these amazing sails on the roof ,
and that , in turn , is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,
cooling them , or heating them , as the need may be .
In the canal , which is just outside the restaurant ,
and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange .
I have no idea how it works , but I paid a lot of money for it .
And what &apos;s great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant
lives on this boat -- it &apos;s off-grid ; it generates all its own power .
He &apos;s growing all his own fruit , and that &apos;s fantastic .
Acorn House is the element of wood ; Waterhouse is the element of water ;
and I &apos;m thinking , well , I &apos;m going to be making
I &apos;ve got water and wood . I &apos;m just about to do fire .
So you &apos;ve got to watch your space for that .
people who believed in what I was doing anyway .
What I needed to do was get food out
or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative .
So I &apos;m committing to potatoes ; I &apos;m committing to milk ;
I &apos;m committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff .
I &apos;ve kept the trunking ; I &apos;ve got in some recycled fridges ;
I &apos;ve got some recycled tills ; I &apos;ve got some recycled trolleys .
In fact , I &apos;m trying and I &apos;m going to make this
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle
and that &apos;s been something that &apos;s been nurturing me for some time ,
But , I wanted to get up and show you
that we can do it if we &apos;re more responsible .
They &apos;re here . You can see I &apos;ve done three so far ;
and recycle -- right at the end there --
recycling is the last point I want to make ;
but it &apos;s the four R &apos;s , rather than the three R &apos;s --
then I think we &apos;re going to be on our way .
So these three are not perfect -- they &apos;re ideas .
I think that there are many problems to come ,
but with help , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to find solutions .
I would like to tell you about a project
And these are made of this kind of tube --
and we can see a little bit backwards in time .
Narrator : Eventually , these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches .
Theo Jansen : I want to put these forms of life on the beaches .
and it &apos;ll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own .
Narrator : The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food , but from the wind .
The wind will move feathers on their back , which will drive their feet .
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach ,
As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand , it stops ,
TJ : This is a herd , and it is built according to genetical codes .
And it is a sort of race , and each and every animal is different ,
This is the wave , going from left to right . You can see this one .
And now it goes from -- yes , now it goes from left to right .
So , the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles ,
And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away ,
and the tide is coming up , and there is still a little bit of energy
to reach the dunes and save their lives , because they are drowned very easily .
So , the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking .
There are 11 numbers , which I call the 11 holy numbers .
These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
In fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
The axis of a wheel is staying on the same level ,
and this hip is staying on the same level as well .
In fact , this is better than a wheel , because
when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,
and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between .
So , 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel ,
we have a new wheel . And I will show you , in the next video
but can also walk on the wind very well .
And this is working on the stored winds in the bottles .
It has a feeler , where it can feel obstacles and turn around .
And that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way .
So , they have to survive all the dangers of the beach ,
and one of the big dangers is the sea . This is the sea .
And it must feel the water of the sea .
And what &apos;s very important is this tube . It sucks in air normally ,
but when it swallows water , it feels the resistance of it .
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
As soon as it touches the water , you should hear a sort of sound of running air .
Yes ! So if it doesn &apos;t feel , it will be drowned , OK ?
In fact , it is a step counter , and it counts the steps .
So as soon it has been to the sea ,
it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here ,
and it knows always where it is on the beach . So it &apos;s very simple brain .
It says , well , there &apos;s the sea , there are dunes , and I &apos;m here .
So it &apos;s a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal .
and when the nose is fixed -- of the animal -- the whole animal is fixed .
And the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
The wind may turn , but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind .
Now , another couple of years , and these animals will survive on their own .
and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism ,
we thought , if this is supposed to be the smallest genome
You can only do them one at a time .
as a side project to sequence the human genome ,
then to try and make serially lots of these pieces
There were several steps to this . There were two sides :
of how , if we had this new chemical entity ,
When we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem ,
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome
And we can walk through the reasons for that ,
So there &apos;s only so many cycles we could go through
So , one of the most important publications we had
I think philosophically , that was one of the most important papers
We didn &apos;t know that it was going to take us
but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome .
We think in part , because of its slow growth
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into
had a nuclease , an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface ,
had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished
but we had a problem because now we had
we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome
And we thought this would be a great test bed
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
but it wouldn &apos;t transplant and boot up a cell .
That little issue took the team two years to solve .
It turns out , the DNA in the bacterial cell
and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme ,
So what we found is if we took the chromosome
And once we had done that , now we can take
when we published the results of that work in Science ,
knowing that we had the biology worked out on that
But it turned out it wasn &apos;t going to be as simple in the end ,
out of over a million base pairs in that sequence .
to see if it would grow in a background
And we found that 10 out of the 11
and found just one base pair had been deleted
where we can put in large blocks of DNA ,
So it took about three months to find that error
So , it &apos;s been a long route to get here :
Early on , when you &apos;re working in a new area of science ,
to believe that you had done something when you hadn &apos;t ,
messages in the genetic code for a long time ,
but it &apos;s clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed
we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound
So we won &apos;t give the rest of the code ,
The second quotation is , &quot; See things not as they are ,
So , because this is as much a philosophical advance
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions
on that side as well as the technical side --
this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community ,
and at the highest levels of the federal government .
that work was funded by the Department of Energy ,
trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it .
And they came down on the side of open publication ,
to open it first to the floor for questions .
Craig Venter : Can we explain how significant this is ?
I &apos;m not sure we &apos;re the ones that should be explaining how significant it is .
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of ,
this is going to be a very powerful set of tools
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these ,
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out ,
Wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds ?
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf
make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
and I promise I will come back to those virgins .
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union ,
But the thing is , how come it &apos;s news to most people ?
is that we imagine that the Koran can be read
as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon
and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad --
is precisely why it &apos;s so easy to quote --
which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists
I realized I needed to read the Koran properly --
and for that I &apos;d worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories ,
that I &apos;d be a tourist in the Koran --
and that , I think , is what is meant by &quot; hubris &quot; --
-- because it turned out to be three months .
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back
where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are .
wondering if I wasn &apos;t lost in a strange land ,
to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels .
reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders
that is the Lord &apos;s Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined .
to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue .
and of humans as mere stewards of God &apos;s creation ,
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men ,
and only if there &apos;s no other pact in place
and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba ,
&quot; Some of these verses are definite in meaning , &quot; it says ,
and indeed , the whole of the Koran is far more subtle
than most of us have been led to believe .
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight .
or it may be like the Greek Kouros or K璐竢鑶 ?
which seems to me a far more appealing prospect
That idea only came into being 300 years later ,
and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent
I study ants , and that &apos;s because I like to think about how organizations work .
And in particular , how the simple parts of organizations
interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .
So , ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that ,
and there are many others . The web is one .
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens ,
and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers .
And all ant colonies have in common that there &apos;s no central control .
The queen just lays the eggs . There &apos;s no management .
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant .
And I try to figure out how that works .
And I &apos;ve been working for the past 20 years
on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona .
Here &apos;s my study site . This is really a picture of ants ,
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds .
This is the nest of the mature colony , and there &apos;s the nest entrance .
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away ,
gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest , and store them .
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site .
This is just a road . And it &apos;s not very big :
it &apos;s about 250 meters on one side , 400 on the other .
And every colony has a name , which is a number ,
which is painted on a rock . And I go there every year
and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before ,
and figure out which ones have died , and put all the new ones on the map .
And by doing this I know how old they all are .
And because of that , I &apos;ve been able to study how their behavior changes
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony .
Ants never make more ants ; colonies make more colonies .
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives --
those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight .
So every year , on the same day -- and it &apos;s a mystery exactly how that happens --
each colony sends out its virgin , unmated queens with wings , and the males ,
and they all fly to a common place . And they mate .
And this shows a recently virgin queen . Here &apos;s her wings .
And she &apos;s in the process of mating with this male ,
and there &apos;s another male on top waiting his turn .
And after that , the males all die . That &apos;s it for them .
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere , drop their wings ,
dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs .
And they will live for 15 or 20 years , continuing to lay eggs
She lays eggs , she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg , then it &apos;s a larva .
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves .
Then , as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge ,
they &apos;re larvae . Then they &apos;re pupae . Then they come out as adult ants .
They go out , they get the food , they dig the nest ,
So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536 .
There &apos;s the nest entrance , there &apos;s a pencil for scale .
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer .
They make a midden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat .
This is a five-year-old colony . This is the nest entrance , here &apos;s a pencil for scale .
This is about as big as they get , about a meter across .
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes --
changes as a function of colony age , in years .
So it starts out with zero ants , just the founding queen ,
and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five .
And it stays that size until the queen dies
and there &apos;s nobody to make more ants , when she &apos;s about 15 or 20 years old .
And it &apos;s when they reach this stable size , in numbers of ants ,
That is , to send more winged queens and males to that year &apos;s mating flight .
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age
because I &apos;ve dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants .
So that &apos;s not the most fun part of this research , although it &apos;s interesting .
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation .
How is it that the colony manages to adjust
the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change ?
When it rains in the summer , it floods in the desert .
and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess .
and this is what everybody knows about picnics --
then extra ants are allocated to collect the food .
So , with nobody telling anybody what to do , how is it that
the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task ?
And that &apos;s the process that I call task allocation .
of the ants I see just outside the nest
into these four categories : where an ant is foraging ,
when it &apos;s out along the foraging trail , searching for food or bringing food back .
The patrollers -- that &apos;s supposed to be a magnifying glass --
are an interesting group that go out early in the morning
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go ,
and by coming back -- just by making it back --
they tell the foragers that it &apos;s safe to go out .
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest ,
and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman &apos;s house .
they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil
and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings
of the Hopi people that are in that area .
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest ,
and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles .
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand ,
put it down , turn around , and go back in .
And finally , the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse .
On one day , it &apos;ll all be here , and then the next day
they &apos;ll move it over there , and then they &apos;ll move it back .
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .
So that &apos;s only about 25 percent of the colony , and they &apos;re the oldest ants .
So , an ant starts out somewhere near the queen .
And when we dig up nests we find they &apos;re about as deep
as the colony is wide , so about a meter deep for the big old nests .
And then there &apos;s another long tunnel and a chamber , where we often find the queen ,
after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes .
I don &apos;t think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe
The queen &apos;s in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs .
There &apos;s the larvae , and they consume most of the food .
that the ants you see walking around don &apos;t do much eating .
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae .
When the foragers come in with food , they just drop it into the upper chamber ,
and other ants come up from below , get the food ,
bring it back , husk the seeds , and pile them up .
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest .
And curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time
about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .
about , you know , &quot; Look to the ant , thou sluggard , &quot;
in fact , you could think of those ants as reserves .
That is to say , if something happened -- and I &apos;ve never seen anything like this happen ,
but I &apos;ve only been looking for 20 years --
if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed .
But in fact , mostly they &apos;re just hanging around in there .
And I think it &apos;s a very interesting question --
what is there about the way the colony is organized
that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing ?
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between
the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside .
And if you mark ants that are working outside , and dig up a colony ,
So what &apos;s happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they &apos;re younger .
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce .
And once they belong to the ants that work outside , they never go back down .
Now ants -- most ants , including these , don &apos;t see very well .
They have eyes , they can distinguish between light and dark ,
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought
you know , even if the queen did have the intelligence
to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers
there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see
the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .
So that &apos;s one way that we know the queen isn &apos;t directing the behavior of the colony .
So when I first set out to work on task allocation ,
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ?
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing ? &quot;
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant
And instead I wanted to ask , &quot; How are the different task groups interdependent ? &quot;
So I did experiments where I changed one thing .
So for example , I created more work for the nest maintenance workers
by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance ,
early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active .
This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later .
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks
to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there .
here &apos;s a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited --
is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks ? &quot;
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked .
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which .
and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers ,
well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are interdependent .
So , if I change the numbers performing one task ,
that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up ,
And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .
And the second result , which was surprising to a lot of people ,
The same ant doesn &apos;t do the same task over and over its whole life .
So for example , if I put out extra food , everybody else --
the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food ,
But not every transition is possible . And this shows how it works .
Like I just said , if there is more food to collect , the patrollers , the midden workers ,
the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage .
so I created a disturbance , so extra patrollers were needed --
But if more nest maintenance work is needed --
for example , if I put out a bunch of toothpicks --
then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance ,
they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest .
So foraging acts as a sink , and the ants inside the nest act as a source .
And finally , it looks like each ant is deciding
moment to moment whether to be active or not .
So , for example , when there &apos;s extra nest maintenance work to do ,
it &apos;s not that the foragers switch over . I know that they don &apos;t do that .
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out .
And here was the most intriguing result : the task allocation .
This process changes with colony age , and it changes like this .
When I do these experiments with older colonies --
so ones that are five years or older --
they &apos;re much more consistent from one time to another
the more I hassle them , the more they act like undisturbed colonies .
the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable .
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year .
So , the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable
are not any older than the ants in the younger colony .
It &apos;s not due to the experience of older , wiser ants .
And the obvious thing that &apos;s changing is its size .
So since I &apos;ve had this result , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out
what kinds of decision rules -- very simple , local , probably olfactory , chemical
rules could an ant could be using , since no ant can assess the global situation --
And it would change as the colony gets larger .
And what I &apos;ve found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact .
So anybody who &apos;s ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae .
and it can tell , for example , whether the other ant is a nest mate
because ants cover themselves and each other , through grooming ,
with a layer of grease , which carries a colony-specific odor .
And what we &apos;re learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts ,
the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks , in deciding what to do .
And so what the message is , is not any message
that they transmit from one ant to another , but the pattern .
And I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more about that .
how is it that an ant can tell , for example , I &apos;m a forager .
I expect to meet another forager every so often .
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers ,
these hydrocarbons , this layer of grease on the outside of ants ,
the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change ,
and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons --
they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow
keep track of the rate at which they &apos;re meeting ants of certain tasks .
by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads ,
and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact
with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it ,
So I want now to show you a bit of film --
and this will start out , first of all , showing you the nest entrance .
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance .
They &apos;ve gone out to do different tasks , and the rate at which they meet
as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines , or influences ,
each ant &apos;s decision about whether to go out , and which task to perform .
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope . It &apos;s down inside the nest .
just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope .
But the idea is that the ants are in there ,
and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it --
whether the ant comes back out , and what it does when it comes back out .
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these .
Each ant , then , as it comes back in , is contacting other ants .
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance
to decide whether to go out on their next trip ,
So , what &apos;s interesting about this system is that it &apos;s messy .
It &apos;s variable . It &apos;s noisy . And , in particular , in two ways .
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can &apos;t be very predictable .
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on
all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside .
And the second thing is that an ant &apos;s ability to assess this pattern
must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting .
So , we do a lot of simulation and modeling , and also experimental work ,
to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to ,
in the aggregate , produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies .
Again , I don &apos;t want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions
produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .
In fact , if you watch ants at all , you end up trying to help them
exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it .
So it &apos;s not really that out of these haphazard contacts , perfection arises .
Ants have been around for several hundred million years .
that this pattern of haphazard contacts , in the aggregate ,
produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants .
And one of the things that we &apos;re studying is how natural selection
might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns --
to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies .
So the one thing , though , that I want you to remember about this
are something that you &apos;d expect to be closely connected to colony size .
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony --
and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule ,
like &quot; I expect to meet another forager every three seconds . &quot;
But in a small colony , it &apos;s likely to meet fewer foragers ,
just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet .
So this is the kind of rule that , as the colony develops and gets older and larger ,
will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one .
Writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
And I don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently
which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book ,
went out in the world for some reason , and became this big ,
The result of which is that everywhere I go now ,
Like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say ,
&quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life
and you &apos;re never again going to create a book
that anybody in the world cares about at all ,
But it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember
that over 20 years ago , when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager --
I was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
And people would say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
Aren &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
Aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft
and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams
with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot;
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besides
the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?
to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
You know , and what is it specifically about creative ventures
that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health
in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer
and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering
anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
It didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block John , how &apos;s it going ?
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fair , chemical engineers as a group
We writers , we kind of do have that reputation ,
and not just writers , but creative people across all genres ,
it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count
in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds
who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally commit suicide
seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
Norman Mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said
&quot; Every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
An extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
But we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this
because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long
this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked
and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today
is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know --
and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation --
it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path
Which is -- you know , like check it out ,
I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
And it &apos;s exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward
is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after
I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now --
it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
You know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person
to start drinking gin at nine o &apos;clock in the morning ,
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection ,
that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing ,
is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance
between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety
about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that
to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have
about how to help creative people , sort of manage
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
So stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit
that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source ,
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; daemons . &quot;
but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
Which is great , because the Romans did not actually think
They believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity ,
who was believed to literally live in the walls
of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like Dobby the house elf ,
and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work
So brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I &apos;m talking about --
that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things ,
If your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it ,
everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
If your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
and we had this big idea , and the big idea was
let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe
above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room
for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
You know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person
to believe that he or she is like , the vessel ,
you know , like the font and the essence and the source
is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
Maybe we can &apos;t just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought
who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is --
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something --
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone ,
who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life
and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia ,
and she said she would feel and hear a poem
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
And she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point ,
and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
And she would run like hell to the house
and she would be getting chased by this poem ,
and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil
fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it
so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house
and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it
and she said it would continue on across the landscape ,
she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper
and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her ,
and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand
and she would pull it backwards into her body
And in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact
but backwards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s uncanny ,
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pipeline !
I &apos;m a mule , and the way that I have to work
is that I have to get up at the same time every day ,
and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
even I have brushed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds ,
And for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that
who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
and you know , Tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment
and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me ,
and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden
that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing ,
and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil ,
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him
and then I &apos;m going to be haunted by this song forever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
He just looked up at the sky , and he said ,
&quot; Excuse me , can you not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment
Not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety around it
was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him
where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from ,
and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing
So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit
the way that I worked too , and it already saved me once .
This idea , it saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot;
and I fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair
that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming
and you start to think this is going to be a disaster ,
this is going to be the worst book ever written .
Not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
And I started to think I should just dump this project .
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript
and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this ,
So if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
O.K. But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
And I would please like the record to reflect today
that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music
that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals
But every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen ,
and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about ,
because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal
and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 nights before ,
And all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
He would be lit from within , and lit from below
people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant ,
when the Moors invaded southern Spain , they took this custom with them
which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
In Spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic ,
incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of God .
and discovers that it &apos;s Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &apos;s no longer a glimpse of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mortal with really bad knees ,
and maybe he &apos;s never going to ascend to that height again .
And maybe nobody will ever chant God &apos;s name again as he spins ,
and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of anguish
if you never happened to believe , in the first place ,
that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you
from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life
to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and this is certainly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months
as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published ,
And what I have to , sort of keep telling myself
Continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to dance , do your dance .
If the divine , cockeyed genius assigned to your case
decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed , for just one moment
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution ,
but I &apos;d like to argue that it &apos;s done ; we won .
We &apos;ve had a digital revolution but we don &apos;t need to keep having it .
These are some projects I &apos;m involved in today at MIT ,
This first one , Internet Zero , up here -- this is a web server
that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag --
about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob ,
It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet
so you could send it optically ; you can communicate acoustically
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet
and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero ,
So this is the next step from there to here ,
A step after that is a project on fungible computers .
Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded .
So , half as much grain is half as much useful ,
but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than
and we &apos;ve been trying to make computers that work that way .
So , what you see in the background is a prototype .
This was from a thesis of a student , Bill Butow , now at Intel ,
who wondered why , instead of making bigger and bigger chips ,
you don &apos;t make small chips , put them in a viscous medium ,
and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch .
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer ;
on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype
we made , but there &apos;s no frame buffer , IO processor ,
any of that stuff -- it &apos;s just this material .
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully ,
If you add twice as much of it , you have twice as much display .
If you shoot a gun through the middle , nothing happens .
If you need more resource , you just apply more computer .
So , that &apos;s the step after this -- of computing as a raw material .
That &apos;s still conventional bits , the step after that is --
Now , integrating chemistry in computation , where the bits are bubbles .
This is showing making bits , this is showing --
once again , slowed down so you can see it ,
bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing .
So , now we can compute that the output arranges material
as well as information . And , ultimately , these are some slides
from an early project I did , computing where the bits are stored
All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further ,
not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms ,
We all know we &apos;ve had a digital revolution , but what is that ?
Well , Shannon took us , in the &apos; 40s , from here to here :
from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance
to the Internet . And he proved the first threshold theorem , that shows
if you add information and remove it to a signal ,
Von Neumann , in the &apos; 50s , did the same thing for computing ;
he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state
to make it perfect . This was the last great analog computer at MIT :
a differential analyzer , and the more you ran it ,
After Von Neumann , we have the Pentium , where the billionth transistor
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner .
A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal ,
or you maybe melt some plastic . A 10-billion-dollar chip fab
uses a process a village artisan would recognize --
but precisely the same idea , precisely the same math
Shannon and Von Neuman did , hasn &apos;t yet come out
colleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms
at MIT -- which is a group of people , like me ,
and computer science . I would even go further and say
computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened
many of them are great but the canon of computer science
and nature &apos;s a much more powerful computer than that .
So , you &apos;ll hear , tomorrow , from Saul Griffith . He was one of the
We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate .
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles
the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways
that protein are fabricated . So , you can , for example , do that .
You can do other things . That &apos;s in 2D . It works in 3D .
The video on the upper right -- I won &apos;t show for time --
that can make something , and we &apos;re doing that now over , maybe ,
nine orders of magnitude . Those ideas have been used to show
the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism ,
that code for their assembly -- so , much like the magnets ,
functional systems , all the way up to building buildings ,
but having the parts code for the structure of the building .
So , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies
but computers that are tools , where the output of a program
Now , to do that -- with your tax dollars , thank you --
I bought all these machines . We made a modest proposal
to the NSF . We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale ,
all in one place , because you can &apos;t segregate digital fabrication
and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems .
But I had a problem . Once I had all these machines ,
I was spending too much time teaching students to use them .
&quot; How To Make Almost Anything . &quot; And that wasn &apos;t meant to be provocative ;
But the first day of class looked like this .
all my life I &apos;ve been waiting for this class ; I &apos;ll do anything to do it .
Then they &apos;d ask , can you teach it at MIT ? It seems too useful ?
-- surprising thing was they weren &apos;t there to do research .
They were there because they wanted to make stuff .
At the end of a semester they integrated their skills .
I &apos;ll show an old video . Kelly was a sculptor , and this is what she did
: Kelly : Hi , I &apos;m Kelly and this is my scream buddy .
where you really have to scream , but you can &apos;t because you &apos;re at work ,
or you &apos;re in a classroom , or you &apos;re watching your children ,
or you &apos;re in any number of situations where it &apos;s just not permitted ?
Well , scream buddy is a portable space for screaming .
When a user screams into scream buddy , their scream is silenced .
It is also recorded for later release where , when and how
This student made a web browser for parrots --
lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots .
to prove you &apos;re awake ; this is one that defends --
This is a device that lets you see your music .
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines ,
and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing .
Just year after year -- and I finally realized
the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication
You don &apos;t need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart ;
Ken Olsen famously said , nobody needs a computer in the home .
But you don &apos;t use it for inventory and payroll ;
DEC is now twice bankrupt . You don &apos;t need personal fabrication
in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it .
You need it for what makes you unique , just like personalization .
So , with that , in turn , 20 million dollars today does this ;
20 years from now we &apos;ll make Star Trek replicators that make anything .
The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication .
Today , when you spend that much of your money ,
there &apos;s a government requirement to do outreach , which often means
classes at a local school , a website -- stuff that &apos;s just not that exciting .
So , I made a deal with my NSF program managers that
instead of talking about it , I &apos;d give people the tools .
but we put together these Fab Labs . It &apos;s about 20,000 dollars in equipment
that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it &apos;s going .
A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D ,
a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics ,
and microseconds on up , and they exploded around the world .
This wasn &apos;t scheduled , but they went from inner-city Boston
to the far north of Norway , uncovering , or helping uncover ,
we would find unused computers in all these places .
A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify
the world , not just get information about it on a screen .
That there &apos;s really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses .
we saw this same progression : that we &apos;d open one of these Fab Labs ,
where we didn &apos;t -- this is too crazy to think of .
We didn &apos;t think this up , that we would get pulled to these places ;
we &apos;d open it . The first step was just empowerment .
You can see it in their face , just this joy of , I can do it .
This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech
on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center .
It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education
informally , out of schools . In Ghana we had set up one of these labs .
We designed a network sensor , and kids would show up
There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night --
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor .
So she insisted on fabbing the board , learning how to stuff it ,
learning how to program it . She didn &apos;t really know
what she was doing or why she was doing it , but she knew
she just had to do it . There was something electric about it .
This is late at , you know , 11 o &apos;clock at night
and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built
And I &apos;ve shown this to engineers at big companies , and they say
they can &apos;t do this . Any one thing she &apos;s doing , they can do better ,
but it &apos;s distributed over many people and many sites
what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing .
: Girl : My name is Valentina Kofi ; I am eight years old .
And , again , that was just for the joy of it .
Then these labs started doing serious problem solving --
We &apos;re learning more from them than we &apos;re giving them .
I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it .
They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box --
which , as you see up there , that &apos;s becoming a business --
but their design was better than Saul &apos;s design at MIT ,
so there &apos;s now three students at MIT doing their theses on
And I still kept -- so , in the last year I &apos;ve been spending time with
heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this ,
and I keep saying , but this isn &apos;t the real thing .
Wait , like , 20 years and then we &apos;ll be done .
And I finally got what &apos;s been going on . This is Kernigan and Ritchie
They were tens of thousands of dollars , hard to use ,
These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP .
isn &apos;t a projection for the future ; we are now in the PDP era .
We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then .
It was very chaotic , it wasn &apos;t , sort of , clear what was going on .
In the same sense we are now , today , in the minicomputer era
The only problem with that is it breaks everybody &apos;s boundaries .
In DC , I go to every agency that wants to talk , you know ;
in the Bay Area , I go to every organization you can think of --
they all want to talk about it , but it breaks
their organizational boundaries . In fact , it &apos;s illegal for them ,
in many cases , to equip ordinary people to create
And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention
it &apos;s the social engineering . That the lab in far north of Norway --
this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground
rather than the sky because that &apos;s where the satellites are --
the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in .
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains
but it outgrew it , so they built this extraordinary village for the lab .
This isn &apos;t a university ; it &apos;s not a company . It &apos;s essentially
a village for invention ; it &apos;s a village for the outliers in society ,
and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs
So this program has split into an NGO foundation ,
a Fab Foundation to support the scaling , a micro VC fund .
The person who runs it nicely describes it as
&quot; machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses : &quot;
it &apos;s a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out ,
and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what &apos;s
So I &apos;d like to leave you with two thoughts .
There &apos;s been a sea change in aid , from top-down mega-projects
But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects .
Computing , communication , energy for the rest of the planet
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that
The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world
to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .
I thought that &apos;s the projection 20 years hence into the future ,
It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of .
The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering
And , finally , any talk like this on the future of computing
is required to show Moore &apos;s law , but my favorite version --
this is Gordon Moore &apos;s original one from his original paper --
and what &apos;s happened is , year after year after year ,
and we &apos;ve scaled , and we &apos;ve scaled and we &apos;ve scaled ,
and there &apos;s this looming bug of what &apos;s going to happen
at the end of Moore &apos;s law ; this ultimate bug is coming .
But we &apos;re coming to appreciate , is the transition from 2D to 3D ,
turns the ends of Moore &apos;s law scaling from the ultimate bug
So , we &apos;re just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication ,
where the output of computation programs the physical world .
I hadn &apos;t asked carefully . The class at MIT shows the killer app
is technology for a market of one : personal expression in technology
that touches a passion unlike anything I &apos;ve seen in technology
And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation
And everyone in this room has to get into it .
And you can go backwards , you can go forwards ;
And I wonder what you &apos;d choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were automobiles
I &apos;m not part of that crowd , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m adventurous .
So I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
This is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet
a nine at the beginning of my death number .
the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago
seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t --
because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
That number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s disgraceful .
and unless we innovate our way out of this mess ,
So the question is : Can we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food
that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night --
one of the things that keeps me up at night :
We &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . Never .
to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back
more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
You &apos;re not entitled to your own facts . Sorry , you &apos;re not .
About a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines
the most effective public health measure in human history .
so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
We type , we file , we go to dinner . It &apos;s fine .
and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
And that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy
They were exactly like the people in this room .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it :
Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
with the people we used to believe were always right ,
you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reason that I can say that is because
like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
About 12 years ago , there was a story published ,
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
Tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
The data came back from the United States , from England ,
we believe what we see , what we think we see ,
and I do understand that , I think we all do .
The United States is one of the only countries in the world
where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds ,
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same ,
And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
It &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids
Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines
and that people ought to just stop the whining .
that they remember where his kids go to school .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said
She wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate her kid against polio ,
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ?
Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning ,
and he &apos;s flying to LAX , right now he &apos;s over Ohio .
And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car ,
and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralytic disease ,
and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
That &apos;s the planet we live on . Don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
Now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . We love to do it .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines ,
They darken your urine . They almost never do more than that .
It &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma .
We hate Big Government . We don &apos;t trust the Man .
and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
So we run away from it , and where do we run ?
And I have all sorts of little props here .
acai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is
but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people scream at me ,
and they say , &quot; What do you care ? Let people do what they want to do .
who &apos;s saying , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence
or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient
you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
Every single thing we eat , every grain of rice ,
You know , there weren &apos;t tangerines in the garden of Eden .
And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more precise way --
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice ,
And you know what my response to all of that is ?
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t ,
we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now ,
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
They need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse ,
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fighting it ?
This is about moving genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
If we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting ,
we &apos;re guilty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of :
There &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this
We can set that time machine on anything we want .
We can move it where we want to move it ,
and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
We have to have these conversations and we have to think ,
but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead ,
Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure
And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea ,
and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like ,
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time ,
and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! --
because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure
who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others ,
and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
And the reason is that business students are trained
And then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top ,
so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential ,
So the average for most people is around 20 inches ;
lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that ,
If you put you put an executive admin. on the team ,
It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
You can just tell beforehand . And why is that ?
you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure ,
We did the exercise again with the same students .
So the same team went from being the very worst
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
And so , this is the value of the experience ,
There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task ,
and that we apply the very best of our thinking ,
that the cost of all this to the world
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC ,
I would bet there aren &apos;t 10 percent of you in the room
that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world .
Are we smarter than anybody else ? I &apos;m not sure .
and on this slide it &apos;s the red blobs on there --
there are five that are operating in the Mid-East ,
and the rest of them are in the United States .
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back .
And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day ,
which is about 25 percent of all the oil used
And we &apos;re doing it with four percent of the population .
And when you look at what we &apos;re using the oil for ,
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user ,
The Chinese have a little bit better plan --
and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel ,
Now I had people in Washington last week told me ,
is what we are going to pay for oil . &quot;
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane .
Run it through the separator and you &apos;re ready to use it .
It &apos;s going to be very simple for us to use .
You &apos;re going to find , and I &apos;ll tell you in just a minute ,
It will replace or be able to be used for that .
Look at the bar on the left . It &apos;s 24 trillion .
from the EIA and onto the industry estimates --
And they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil ,
But anyway , whether they say they &apos;re right or whatever ,
So you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC
But when you look at the natural gas we have
Now let me take you -- I &apos;ve been a realist --
and I &apos;m gone , so it &apos;s up to you --
that we have to get on our own resources in America .
it &apos;s costing us a billion dollars a day for oil .
And at the time I went into the wind business ,
the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded
We found out that we could go to the source rock ,
CA : And now you &apos;re a big investor in that and bringing that to market ?
I &apos;m a geologist , got out of school in &apos; 51,
and I &apos;ve been in the industry my entire life .
I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States .
So you believe in the threat of climate change .
TBP : Well you &apos;re going to have to use something .
CA : No , no . The argument that it &apos;s a bridge fuel makes sense ,
because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy
to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
and I said , &quot; How do you feel about natural gas ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well it &apos;s a bridge fuel , is what it is . &quot;
See but again , I told you , I don &apos;t have to worry with that .
I think you &apos;re a person who believes in your legacy .
You &apos;re one of the few people in a position
Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon ?
because it ends up the government is going to run the program .
I can tell you it will be a failure .
I mean , that was told to be a bad idea 10 times ,
And I can tell you what the last page
of the report that will take them five years to write
You &apos;re going to have to have energy . There is no question .
what about the problem of methane leaking from that ,
CA : We &apos;ve got a little bit of accent incompatibility here , you know .
and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago
I don &apos;t know what in the hell he &apos;s talking about .
is from Midland , Texas to the South Dakota border ,
CA : All right , so you don &apos;t support a carbon tax of any kind
of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels
that we &apos;ll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
TBP : Solar and wind , Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds .
That is , it &apos;s going to be a small part ,
CA : So how does the world get off fossil fuels ?
where you say , &quot; Well let &apos;s don &apos;t use that anymore . &quot;
You &apos;ll keep using it . It is the cleanest of all .
Why ? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas
Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California
I know what you &apos;re telling me , and I &apos;m not disagreeing with you .
How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
What is at the other end of that bridge
that really looks like it might be part of this solution ,
they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?
TBP : I lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
CA : Boone , I really , really appreciate you coming here ,
I think there &apos;s a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
And that was a real gift you gave this audience .
When you think about resilience and technology it &apos;s actually much easier .
You &apos;re going to see some other speakers today , I already know ,
So it &apos;s very easy , comparatively speaking , to be resilient .
I think that , if we look at what happened on the Internet ,
with such an incredible last half a dozen years ,
that it &apos;s hard to even get the right analogy for it .
A lot of how we decide , how we &apos;re supposed to react to things
and what we &apos;re supposed to expect about the future
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust
that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush .
It &apos;s easy to think of this analogy as very different
from some of the other things you might pick .
In 1849 , in that Gold Rush , they took over $ 700 million
worth of gold out of California . It was very real .
The Internet was also very real . This is a real way for humans to
You keep going , and both things are lots of hype .
I don &apos;t have to remind you of all the hype
that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com.
But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush . &quot; Gold . Gold . Gold . &quot;
Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland . Stacks of yellow metal .
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles .
And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly .
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years .
People on the East Coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news ,
and then in 1850 they still hear that . And they think it &apos;s not real .
By about 1852 , they &apos;re thinking , &quot; Am I the stupidest person on Earth
by not rushing to California ? &quot; And they start to decide they are .
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
of 10 , 20 people would caravan across the United States ,
These were typically not solitary efforts . But no matter what ,
if you were a lawyer or a banker , people dropped what they were doing ,
no matter what skill set they had , to go pan for gold .
he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route .
They would take a ship down to Panama , across the isthmus ,
This guy , Dr. Toland , went by covered wagon to California .
This has its parallels , too . Doctors leaving their practices .
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case ,
Same thing happened on the Internet . You get DrKoop.com.
The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships .
They turned the ships into hotels , because they couldn &apos;t sail them anywhere .
You had dotcom fever . And you had gold fever .
that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened .
The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers .
Half of them deserted to go look for gold .
And they wouldn &apos;t let the other half out to go look for the first half
And one of the soldiers wrote home , and this is the sentence that he put :
&quot; The struggle between right and six dollars a month
and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one . &quot;
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush . A very bad burn rate .
This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush . This is the White Pass Trail .
And they didn &apos;t know how far they would really have to go ,
and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff .
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died
And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time :
&quot; Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way ,
with pack saddles and packs where they &apos;ve fallen from the rock above ,
and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march ,
often , I regret to say , exhausted , but still alive ,
a fact we were unaware of , until after the miserable wretches
account for the myriads of ravens along the road .
The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to ,
the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone ,
And you know , without the smell that would have accompanied that ,
we had the same thing on the Internet : very bad burn rate calculations .
I &apos;ll just play one of these and you &apos;ll remember it .
This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000 .
: Bride # 1 : You said you had a large selection of invitations . Clerk : But we do .
Bride # 2 : Then why does she have my invitation ?
Announcer : What may be a little thing to some ... Bride # 3 : You are mine , little man .
Announcer : Could be a really big deal to you . Husband # 1 : Is that your wife ?
Husband # 2 : Not for another 15 minutes . Announcer : After all , it &apos;s your special day .
OurBeginning.com. Life &apos;s an event . Announce it to the world .
Jeff Bezos : It &apos;s very difficult to figure out what that ad is for .
But they spent three and a half million dollars
in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad ,
even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .
Now , here &apos;s where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge ,
And that is , in a gold rush , when it &apos;s over , it &apos;s over .
Here &apos;s this guy : &quot; There are many men in Dawson
They &apos;ve come thousands of miles on a perilous trip , risked life , health and property ,
spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform
and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch
the fact that there is nothing here for them . &quot;
And that was , of course , the very common story .
Because when you take out that last piece of gold --
and they did incredibly quickly . I mean , if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --
the entire American river region , within two years --
every stone had been turned . And after that , only big companies
So there &apos;s a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry .
With the electric industry you actually have to --
one of them is that they &apos;re both sort of thin ,
horizontal , enabling layers that go across lots of different industries .
But electricity is also very , very broad , so you have to sort of narrow it down .
You know , it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power .
There &apos;s a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity .
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb .
So the light bulb is what wired the world .
And they weren &apos;t thinking about appliances when they wired the world .
And , but it really -- it got the electricity . It took a long time .
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out .
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan
where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
The Edison Electric Company , which became Edison General Electric ,
paid for all of this digging up of the streets . It was incredibly expensive .
But that is not the -- and that &apos;s not the part that &apos;s really most similar to the Web .
that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network .
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --
I &apos;m going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994
Well , it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .
So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure ,
And this was huge . The first one was the electric fan --
And the appliances , the golden age of appliances really lasted --
it depends how you want to measure it --
but it &apos;s anywhere from 40 to 60 years . It goes on a long time .
It starts about 1890 . And the electric fan was a big success .
By the way , this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit .
This is the first vacuum cleaner , the 1905 Skinner Vacuum ,
from the Hoover Company . And this one weighed 92 pounds
and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car .
But three years later , by 1908 , it weighed 40 pounds .
This is the electric tie press , which never really did catch on .
People , I guess , decided that they would not wrinkle their ties .
the electric shoe warmer and drier . Never a big seller .
I don &apos;t know why . But I thought , you know ,
sometimes it &apos;s just not the right time for an invention ;
maybe it &apos;s time to give this one another shot .
So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this .
We &apos;d need the right partner . And I thought that really --
I thought that would really work , to give that another shot .
because they used to make toast on open fires ,
and it took a lot of time and attention .
I want to point out one thing . This is -- you guys know what this is .
So this was -- remember , they didn &apos;t wire the houses for electricity .
They wired them for lighting . So your -- your appliances would plug in .
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .
In fact , if you &apos;ve seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World ,
you &apos;ve seen this . Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture .
All the appliances plug in there . And you would just unscrew your light bulb
The next thing that really was a big , big deal was the washing machine .
Now , this was an object of much envy and lust .
On the left-hand side , this was the soapy water .
And there &apos;s a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning .
This is the clean rinse-water . So you &apos;d take the clothes out of here ,
put them in here , and then you &apos;d run the clothes through this electric ringer .
You &apos;d keep this on your porch . It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain .
And you &apos;d run a long cord into the house
where you could screw it into your light socket .
And that &apos;s actually kind of an important point in my presentation ,
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --
I mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clogging up a light socket .
So you know , when you were done with it , you unscrewed it .
That &apos;s what you did . You didn &apos;t turn it off .
And as I said before , they hadn &apos;t invented the electric outlet either ,
so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device .
of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices .
because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house .
And there was no off switch , so it wasn &apos;t very good .
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors
to be plugging things into a light socket like this .
But , you know , before I get too far into condemning our ancestors ,
I thought I &apos;d show you : this is my conference room .
This is a total kludge , if you ask me .
First of all , this got installed upside down . This light socket --
and so the cord keeps falling out , so I taped it in .
This is supposed -- don &apos;t even get me started . But that &apos;s not the worst one .
This is what it looks like under my desk .
So we really haven &apos;t progressed that much since 1908 .
this process has brought them to tears , absolute tears .
And that &apos;s assuming you already have DSL in your house .
The engineers who do it everyday can &apos;t do it .
They have to -- typically , they come three times .
And one friend of mine was telling me a story :
not only did they get there and have to wait ,
but then the engineers , when they finally did get there ,
for the third time , they had to call somebody .
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone
because then they had to wait on hold for an hour
to talk to somebody to give them an access code
I mean , this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed
we &apos;re very , very primitive . And that &apos;s kind of the point .
Because , you know , resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush ,
because the last nugget of gold would be gone .
But the good thing is , with innovation , there isn &apos;t a last nugget .
Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities .
And if you believe that , then you believe that where we are --
this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --
and I haven &apos;t even talked about user interfaces on the Web --
but there &apos;s so much kludge , so much terrible stuff --
we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet .
That &apos;s where we are . We don &apos;t get our hair caught in it ,
but that &apos;s the level of primitiveness of where we are .
And if you believe that , then stuff like this doesn &apos;t bother you . This is 1996 :
&quot; All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble . &quot;
She -- but you know , if you really do believe that it &apos;s the very ,
very beginning , if you believe it &apos;s the 1908 Hurley washing machine ,
then you &apos;re incredibly optimistic . And I do think that that &apos;s where we are .
And I do think there &apos;s more innovation ahead of us
And in 1917 , Sears -- I want to get this exactly right .
This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917 .
It says : &quot; Use your electricity for more than light . &quot;
and why some of you have a pine cone close to you .
Once upon a time , I did a book called &quot; How Buildings Learn . &quot;
A little background : For 10 years I &apos;ve been trying to figure out how to
hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking
to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking
of the now not just as next week or next quarter , but you know ,
next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years --
So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco .
all having to do with continuity over the long term .
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly --
I suppose , a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock
that can really keep good time for that long a period .
And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious .
Go to the clock . And what we have here is something
Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose . It &apos;s presently in London ,
and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there .
So the design problem for today is going to be ,
how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this
so it can really tick , save time beautifully for 100 centuries ?
And it looked like a way to go , until you start thinking
about , what does deep time do to a building ?
Well , this is what deep time does to a building .
This is the Parthenon . It &apos;s only 2,450 years old ,
Here &apos;s a beautiful project . They really knew it &apos;d last forever ,
because they &apos;d build it out of absolutely huge stones .
And now it &apos;s a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .
like the pyramids of Giza , are in bad shape when you look up close .
And they &apos;re built to protect things but they don &apos;t protect things .
So we got to thinking , if you can &apos;t put things safely in a building ,
where can you safely put them ? We thought , OK , underground .
So the obvious answer was , we need a mountain .
if you &apos;re going to have a clock for 10,000 years .
So here &apos;s an image of the long view of the search problem .
And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain ,
so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest .
Then Roger Kennedy , who was the director of the National Parks Service ,
It &apos;s the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet .
And you &apos;ll notice that on the left , on the left , on the west , it &apos;s very steep ,
This place is remote . It &apos;s over 200 miles from any major city .
And it &apos;s -- the only thing that goes by is what &apos;s called
Now , inside the yellow line here , on the right is -- that &apos;s all national park .
And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land .
Now , as it happened , that two-mile-long strip right in the middle ,
this vertical , was available because it was private land .
And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here ,
who started the process , Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land .
And now let &apos;s look at the grand truth of what &apos;s there .
We &apos;re in Pole Canyon , looking west up the western escarpment
of Mount Washington , which is 11,600 feet on top .
and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it ; it would be a serious hike
So last June , the Long Now board , some staff and some donors
and advisors , made a two-week expedition to the mountain
to explore it and investigate , one , if it &apos;s the right mountain ,
and two , if it &apos;s the right mountain , how it might actually work for us .
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work .
It &apos;s what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure .
It starts with the image . The image is a picture you have in your mind
of the goal at the end of the journey .
In this case it might well be an image of the clock .
Then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition
from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
Then -- this is a nice image of it , there &apos;s the labyrinth .
The labyrinth is a concept , it &apos;s like a twilight zone ,
it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s difficult , where you get disoriented ,
maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it
if you &apos;re going to get to some kind of deep reintegration .
Then there should always be in sight the draw --
a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth
Now Brian Eno , who &apos;s been in the thick of the Long Now process ,
spent two years making a C.D. called &quot; January 7003 , &quot;
and it &apos;s &quot; Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now . &quot;
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed ,
makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years .
The Hillis algorithm . 10 factorial gives you that number .
And in fact , pretty soon we &apos;ll hear the sound .
Number five of the seven is the payoff . This is it . The climax .
The goal . The main thing that you &apos;re trying to get to .
And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff .
Something you didn &apos;t expect that caps what you did expect .
You &apos;ve got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world ,
so you have time to assimilate what you &apos;ve learned .
It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain .
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ?
Start with borders . If you look on the left side of the cliffs here ,
you can &apos;t do anything with that . To the right of it is national forest .
And especially trees . Look at those things up on top there .
It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines .
People think they &apos;re just the size of shrubs , but that &apos;s not actually true .
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living .
The wood is so solid it &apos;s like stone , and it lasts for a long time .
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain ,
sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there .
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona
Now , if you guys have a pine cone handy ,
now &apos;s a good time to put it in your hand and feel it , especially on the end .
You &apos;ll find out why it &apos;s called a bristlecone pine . A little sensory experience .
Here &apos;s Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest
on Long Now land . I should say that the age of bristlecones
had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline ,
and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine
And then , based on that principle , he started looking around
he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old .
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right .
OK , onto the mines . The first asking price for the property
when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines .
Because the owner said , &quot; There &apos;s one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain . &quot;
And we said , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s great . Listen , we &apos;ll counter . How about zero ?
And we &apos;re a non-profit foundation , you can give us the property
All you have to do is prove to the government it &apos;s worth a billion dollars . &quot;
Well , a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth ,
and by and by , thanks to Mitch and Jay ,
we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars .
This is one of the mines . It doesn &apos;t have any beryllium in it .
It &apos;s called the Pole Adit . And it does have tungsten ,
a little bit of tungsten , left over , that &apos;s the kind of mine it was .
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line ,
due east into the range , into very interesting territory -- except that ,
as you &apos;ll see when we go inside in a minute ,
we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale .
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring .
and so parts of it are caved in in there .
That &apos;s Ben Roberts from -- he &apos;s the bat specialist from the National Park .
But there are many wonders back in there , like this weird fungus
OK , here &apos;s another mine that &apos;s up on top of the property ,
That &apos;s what the property was originally built around --
it was a set of mining claims . It was a very productive silver mine .
In fact , it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada ,
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .
You may recognize a couple of the miners there .
There &apos;s Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena ,
which is the lead-silver thing . They didn &apos;t find any .
They both kept their day jobs . Here &apos;s the last mine .
It &apos;s called the Bonanza Adit . It &apos;s down in a canyon .
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people
from the National Park to survey the whole mine . It &apos;s a mile deep .
And they also found four species of bats in there .
Now , almost all those mines , by the way , meet underneath the mountain .
They don &apos;t quite , but it &apos;s something to think about .
Let &apos;s go to weather . Mountains specialize in interesting weather .
And so one Tuesday morning last June , there we were .
Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow .
That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again ,
This is , on the left there , the joyful lady is Pat Irwin ,
who &apos;s the regional head of the National Forest Service ,
and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there .
We want a temporary use permit for the clock , eventually --
It runs on solar , and it sends a signal with that antenna
and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere
to a place in Bozeman , Montana , where the data is taken down
where we put the data in real time up on our website .
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington .
As it happens , there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington ,
But there &apos;s no bears , and there &apos;s no poison oak ,
and there &apos;s basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time .
You can hike for days and not encounter anybody .
It &apos;s this beautiful world all of its own , surrounded by cliffs ,
and it &apos;s an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom ,
until you get to this barrier , and it actually presents a problem .
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach .
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain .
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain .
And from where you &apos;re standing at 6,000 feet in the valley ,
it &apos;s an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest
through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet .
And you can carry right on up through meadows
and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet ,
Now , Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition ,
The harder it is to get to , the more people will value it . &quot;
And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there .
and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck
Now , as you gain elevation your IQ goes down --
by how much math he can &apos;t do in his head .
Now , I happened to be on the radio with Alexander
when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs , and he said , quote ,
&quot; There &apos;s a hidden notch . I think I can get up a ways . &quot;
Now , he &apos;s a rock climber , but you know , he &apos;s our executive director .
I don &apos;t want him killed . I know he &apos;s going to love cliffs .
Then he starts going up , and the next thing I hear is ,
&quot; I &apos;m half-way up . It &apos;s like climbing stairs . I &apos;m going up 60 degrees .
It &apos;s a secret passage . It &apos;s like something from Tolkien . &quot;
And then , of course , the next thing I hear is ,
&quot; I &apos;ve made it to the top . You can see all of creation from up here . &quot;
And he dashed across the top of the mountains .
First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington ,
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered .
Zander &apos;s Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra ,
there &apos;s this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra
called the Siq , and so this is the Siq .
And it really is hidden . I can &apos;t find it in this image ,
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there ,
Now , Danny and I were up at this same area one day ,
which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it ,
and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain
could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view .
And the people toiling up the mountain could see them ,
these tiny little people up there , incredibly halfway up the cliff .
How did they get there ? Do I have to do that ?
And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth .
by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there .
And you need to know that Danny &apos;s clock is to be kept accurate
by a ray of sunshine , that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day ,
and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger
which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate .
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on ,
So here we &apos;re looking from the south , look north .
This is all Forest Service land . If you go up on top of those cliffs ,
that &apos;s some of the Long Now land in those trees .
And if you go up there and look back , then you &apos;ll get a sense of
what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain .
That &apos;s the long view . That &apos;s 80 miles to the horizon .
And that &apos;s also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs .
That &apos;s a different place to be . It &apos;s 11,400 feet and it &apos;s exquisite .
Now , if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs ,
it &apos;s 600 foot , just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker &apos;s foot ,
there is a 600-foot drop . He &apos;s ambling on over to Zander &apos;s Siq .
We should probably put in a rail or something .
Over on the eastern side it &apos;s gentle , as you can see .
And that &apos;s not snow -- that &apos;s what the white limestone looks like .
And they &apos;re doing pretty well , but they &apos;ve got a bit of trouble .
This is Danny Hillis , and he &apos;s figuring out a design problem .
he &apos;s trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land
would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .
because the real peak is hidden around the corner .
This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest .
And as it turned out the answer is , yes ,
that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak ,
We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this .
And the third is the experience from the mountain ,
and if you look off to the right , out there ,
In the front , there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains
In fact , there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air .
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch ,
Alfalfa and cattle , run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham ,
And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going .
This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range .
And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end ,
you &apos;ll see what the valley used to look like .
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years .
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see
if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley ,
dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on ,
and there &apos;s a possibility that you could get the whole thing
for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition ,
and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park ,
and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park . That would be swell .
OK , let &apos;s take one more look at the mountain itself .
Now , at the base of the high cliffs there &apos;s this natural cave .
It &apos;s only about 12 feet deep , but what if it were deepened from inside ?
You excavated from somewhere , came up from inside and deepened it .
which was very rough and narrow as you first went in ,
that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite .
You &apos;d have a polished set of passages and chambers in there
And it &apos;s not a mine . This would be a nuanced evocation
and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside .
we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain .
All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them .
It &apos;s not a clock in a mountain -- it &apos;s a mountain clock .
Now , the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying
for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything .
They say , &quot; pin peya obe &quot; -- welcome to the mountain .
and I &apos;ve come to this thing about , like , not sleeping much
as being a great virtue , after years of kind of
battling it as being a terrible detriment , or something .
And now I really like sort of sitting up , you know .
and I think that , like , my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia .
I lie awake . I think thoughts . I walk aimlessly .
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting .
And sometimes -- actually , once it was on Page Six in the Post ,
that I was cruising this guy , like , sort of , whatever ,
but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on .
and we thanked each other and just went on our way .
As a matter of fact , I think a lot of my design ideas
Because I feel like , you know , there are so many images out there ,
And the only ones that look interesting to me
are the ones that look slightly mistaken , of course ,
and I see a hole in a shirt , or something
in some way that I &apos;d never seen happen before .
And so I &apos;d make the car stop , and I &apos;d get out of the car and walk ,
and see that in fact there wasn &apos;t a hole , but it was a trick of my eye ,
Or if there was a hole I &apos;d think like , oh damn ,
there was actually someone thought of that thought already .
Someone made that mistake already so I can &apos;t do it anymore .
As a matter of fact , one of the most fun things
was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York .
I read &quot; Peter and the Wolf &quot; with this beautiful band from Juilliard .
And I did like , you know , the narrator , and I read it .
And I saw this really smart critic who I love .
This woman , Joan Acocella , who &apos;s a friend of mine ,
oh , you know , Isaac , did you know that , talking about Stalinism
and talking about , you know , like the &apos; 30s in Russia .
And I said , how do I know about Stalinism ?
I know about a wolf and a bird and , you know ,
he ate the bird , and then in the end you hear , you know ,
you hear the bird squeaking , or something , you know ?
So I don &apos;t really know that . I don &apos;t really --
actually I do my own kind of research , you know .
If I &apos;m commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera , or something like that ,
I will do a lot of research , because it &apos;s interesting ,
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors ,
or light from the projection , makes the colors look so impossible .
And anyway , roll this little clip , I &apos;ll just show you .
I sit up at night and I watch movies
and about how you have to , like , watch what your daughters look at .
Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time .
or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , ironically glorified ,
or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of denigrated , or ironically denigrated .
So that &apos;s what I do . I study color a lot .
But for the most part , I think , like , how can I ever make anything
that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood ?
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ?
And so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , I guess , you know .
I want to show you -- I &apos;m also like a big --
I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often ,
and that &apos;s another thing that motivates me a lot .
People say , oh , do that . An astrologer tells me to do something .
When I was about 21 , an astrologer told me
that I was going to meet the man of my dreams ,
and that his name was going to be Eric , right ?
So , you know , for years I would go to bars
and , sort of , anyone I met whose name was Eric
And there were times when I was actually so desperate
I would just , you know , walk into a room and just go like , &quot; Eric ! &quot;
And anybody who would turn around I would , sort of , make a beeline for .
And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago .
The last card he pulled , which was representing my destiny
was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane
and you know , sort of spats and this , you know , a minstrel singer , right ?
I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing
: Thank you . We can do anything you ask .
The name of the show is based on this story
that I have to tell you about my mother .
It &apos;s sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers .
And this has to do with being happy , I swear .
I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year , right .
so we decided to invite them all to dinner , our parents .
And we , you know , sort of introduced them to each other .
My mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother ,
who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing .
So my mother was a little offended . She turned to her and she said ,
&quot; Are you kidding ? They have the greatest life together .
That &apos;s the name of the show , they eat out , they --
So in editing these clips , I didn &apos;t have the audacity
to edit a clip of me singing at Joe &apos;s Pub .
So you &apos;ll have to , like , go check it out and come see me or something .
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing , you know .
because if I just do one thing all the time ,
I don &apos;t know , I get very , very bored . I bore very easily .
And you know , I don &apos;t say that I do everything well ,
I just say that I do a lot of things , that &apos;s all .
And I kind of try not to look back , you know .
Except , I guess , that &apos;s what staying up every night is about .
Like , looking back and thinking , what a fool you made of yourself , you know .
I started making puppets when I was a kid .
Maybe that &apos;s where the whole inspiration thing started from , puppets , right .
And somehow , from there , I got interested in design .
and then I began my career as a designer .
I don &apos;t really think of myself as a designer ,
I don &apos;t really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer .
And frankly , I don &apos;t really know what to call myself .
I think of myself as a ... I don &apos;t know what I think of myself as .
But I must say , this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time ,
that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer .
You always have to be slightly bored with everything .
And if you &apos;re not , you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything .
But I am really a little bored with everything .
I always say to my partner , Marisa Gardini , who books everything --
And I always tell her that I find myself
with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
Too much time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like that &apos;s
I thought that the most unboring place in the world
like for a day show . Some kind of day talk show .
Because it &apos;s all of these things that I love
And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing ,
and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
And that was a very , very , very big part of my process .
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie .
IM : Look how cute she looks with this , just a slick back .
IM : Ah , wow , delish . All right . So now where should I position myself ?
I don &apos;t want to be -- okay . Here we go .
I don &apos;t think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous .
IM : You look so cute already , by the way .
IM : Do you have a problem with looking cute ? You want to look cute .
IM : Just checking , because some people want to look , you know ,
IM : You read about all these people who have a lot of money
and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow , like ,
And there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , Rosie .
Because just because if you &apos;re fabulously rich , and fabulously famous ,
because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting messed up ?
ROD : No , but it means that your priority has to be
But you have to make the decision for yourself .
They &apos;re going to be like 14 and in rehab .
My God , this is the shortest I &apos;ve ever had .
A : I was going to ask you , has your hair ever been --
IM : I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here .
IM : Are you freaking out ? You look so cute .
ROD : No , I love it . It &apos;s the new me .
IM : So by the way . Of all the most unboring things in the world , right .
I mean , like making someone who &apos;s already cute look terrible like that .
That is not boring . That is nothing if it &apos;s not boring .
Actually , I read this great quote the other day , which was ,
&quot; Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
Right ? And then I realized , that was on my website ,
and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me
and I thought , oh , I said something , you know , in an interview .
I forgot that I said that . But it &apos;s really true .
I want to show you this last clip because it &apos;s going to be my last goodbye .
I &apos;ll tell you that I cook a lot also . I love to cook .
And I often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
Like I say , oh , you know , would you serve a rotten chicken ?
Then how could you serve , you know , a beat up old dress or something .
How could you show a beat up old dress ?
And so I think that &apos;s what it all boils down to .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing because I think it &apos;s the most fun thing in the world .
It &apos;s got a lot of different things on it .
And it &apos;s kind of my favorite thing in the world .
And it just began like in the beginning of February . So who knows ?
And again , I don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , I just think it &apos;s not boring , right ?
IM : I have to tell you , I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time .
IM : Yeah , but I can never find buttermilk , ever .
IM : You can &apos;t find buttermilk at Citarella ; you can &apos;t find buttermilk .
Chef : Oh , you don &apos;t know ? Let me tell you something .
IM : You know what ? Stop laughing . It &apos;s not funny .
Just because I don &apos;t know that whole -- that there &apos;s no such thing as whole buttermilk .
Chef : Well , here &apos;s the deal . Let me tell you the deal .
In the old days when they used to make butter ,
Chef : So you take heavy , high-fat milk , which is cream ,
and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water .
And that &apos;s what it was in the early days .
And that &apos;s what people used for baking and all sorts of things .
Now , the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk .
Chef : The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious .
Happy TED . It &apos;s so wonderful here . I love it . I love it . I love it .
why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries
or &quot; How could we have better prepared for that ? &quot;
what brings me to the TED stage here today ,
over the course of the last decades , at least , and beyond .
I want to share some of that story with you ,
and the role of social movements in creating change
by first of all giving a very , very brief history of time ,
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century
and that age The New York Times dubbed recently
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders
that the people who &apos;ve been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior ,
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists
I was , by the way -- I &apos;m an Essex lad ,
At the age of 17 , I was recruiting people from Cambridge University
I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.
At the age of 21 , I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan .
and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience .
and what took me from Essex all the way across the world --
by the way , we were laughing at democratic activists .
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear .
So as I said , we looked to the status quo
And it &apos;s not just Islamist extremists that did this .
If you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late ,
In others , kosher and halal meat are being banned ,
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected
in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream .
that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot :
This Nigerian student studied in London , trained in Yemen ,
was represented by his father , the head of the Nigerian bank ,
warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack ,
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this .
And a social movement is comprised , in my view ,
and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of ,
If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda ,
If I ask you to think of their narratives --
the West being at war with Islam , the need to defend Islam against the West --
the idea is the cause that one believes in ;
and the narrative is the way to sell that cause --
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately .
If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders ,
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .
They &apos;re transnational , and they bond around these ideas and narratives
if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan ,
One of the problems we &apos;re facing is , in my view ,
There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda , without the terrorism ,
There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols
whether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism --
one version of Islam over the rest of society --
they don &apos;t feel the need to advocate for that culture .
we associate believing in the universality of our values --
democratic culture is the best that we &apos;ve arrived at
but then the other parties ask them to vote for them
And then people say , &quot; We &apos;ve tried democracy . It doesn &apos;t really work .
is what I &apos;ve labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance .
than it is today with the world superpower being America ,
make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread
the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated .
well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia .
International aid and development has been going on for years ,
but extremism in those societies , in many of those societies ,
Not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them ,
is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .
have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots .
they &apos;ve been building demand for their ideology on the ground .
But without freedom of speech , you can &apos;t have free and fair elections .
Without human rights , you don &apos;t have the protection granted to you to campaign .
So what &apos;s needed is those organizations on the ground
to create the demand on the ground for this culture .
is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier ,
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level ,
is this ideal that you see on the slide here --
the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy ,
but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship --
and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box .
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt
We need to move one step beyond that now .
We need to see how we can help those societies
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt , it spread across the region .
In the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s when Islamism started in the region ,
it spread across the MENA region as a whole .
And the aspiration that we have at the moment --
as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism --
and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that .
And we &apos;ve made a start for that in Pakistan
where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth
And my time is up , and thank you for your time .
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape ,
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories
I &apos;ll start here . Last November there was a presidential election .
You probably read something about it in the papers .
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country
And so a plan came up to video the vote .
with phones capable of taking photos or making video
on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques ,
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --
that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes ,
but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall .
So this is a pattern that assumes we &apos;re all in this together .
It isn &apos;t when the shiny new tools show up
It &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
that people can take for granted the idea that we &apos;re all in this together .
And so we &apos;re starting to see a media landscape
Not to put too fine a point on it , the moment we &apos;re living through --
the moment our historical generation is living through --
Now that &apos;s a big claim . I &apos;m going to try to back it up .
There are only four periods in the last 500 years
where media has changed enough to qualify for the label &quot; revolution . &quot;
The first one is the famous one , the printing press :
movable type , oil-based inks , that whole complex of innovations
and turned Europe upside-down , starting in the middle of the 1400s .
there was a revolution in recorded media other than print :
And finally , about 100 years ago , the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum
to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television .
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century .
This is what those of us of a certain age
in this world , you have it with one other person .
If you want to address a group , you get the same message
and you give it to everybody in the group ,
whether you &apos;re doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen
media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations .
magazines migrate to the Internet , movies migrate to the Internet .
media is increasingly less just a source of information ,
and it is increasingly more a site of coordination ,
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
can now gather around and talk to each other as well .
is that members of the former audience , as Dan Gilmore calls them ,
It &apos;s as if , when you bought a book , they threw in the printing press for free ;
it &apos;s like you had a phone that could turn into a radio
even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well .
massive destruction in a wide area , as the Richter Scale has it .
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening .
People were texting from their phones . They were taking photos of buildings .
They were uploading it to QQ , China &apos;s largest Internet service .
or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --
there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter .
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude
it took them three months to admit that it had happened .
Now they might have liked to have done that here ,
because their own citizens beat them to the punch .
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens ,
nine of the top 10 links were about the quake .
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill , but that &apos;s the Internet for you .
But nine of the 10 in those first hours .
And within half a day donation sites were up ,
and donations were pouring in from all around the world .
And the Chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness ,
decided that they were going to let it go ,
that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
People began to figure out , in the Sichuan Provence ,
that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --
because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --
to allow those building to be built to less than code .
reporting that as well . And there was an incredible picture .
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times .
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street ,
Essentially to say , &quot; We will do anything to placate you ,
Someone who has seen the death of a single child
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .
using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China .
they are able to filter it as it comes into the country .
the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction
because not one of those four things was true in this environment .
The media was produced locally . It was produced by amateurs .
It was produced quickly . And it was produced at such an incredible abundance
that there was no way to filter it as it appeared .
And so now the Chinese government , who for a dozen years ,
is now in the position of having to decide
is so enormous that they can &apos;t deal with it any other way .
that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter ,
because there was no way to filter it other than that .
Now these changes don &apos;t just affect people who want to censor messages .
They also affect people who want to send messages ,
because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole ,
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network .
Bundle up the message . Send the same message to everybody .
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global ,
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages
to the outside world , to the distributed collection of the audience ,
And that &apos;s a little freaky . But you can get used to it after a while , as people do .
But that &apos;s not the really crazy change that we &apos;re living in the middle of .
it &apos;s the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other ,
the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another ;
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals ,
the complexity of the network is actually the square
most of the media that was available for public consumption
It is the green lines now , that are the source of the free content ,
And I don &apos;t mean most imaginative use in politics --
And one of the things Obama did , was they famously ,
the Obama campaign did , was they famously put up
and to try and figure out how to help .
Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA ,
He had said , in January , that he would not sign a bill
By the summer , in the middle of the general campaign ,
He said , &quot; I &apos;ve thought about the issue more . I &apos;ve changed my mind .
It was Senator Obama when they created it . They changed the name later .
within weeks of its being created it was the largest group .
And he said essentially , &quot; I have considered the issue .
But having considered it all , I &apos;m still going to vote the way I &apos;m going to vote .
But I wanted to reach out to you and say , I understand that you disagree with me ,
and I &apos;m going to take my lumps on this one . &quot;
This didn &apos;t please anybody . But then a funny thing happened in the conversation .
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group
as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was
In a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap ,
in a world of media where the former audience
in that world , media is less and less often
I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard
isn &apos;t whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in .
&quot; How can we make best use of this media ?
Even though it means changing the way we &apos;ve always done it . &quot;
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it
because in every society , especially an open democratic society ,
it &apos;s only when ideas take root that things change .
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression ,
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security ,
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt &apos;s time .
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution , which lead to deregulation .
is what I call as &quot; the ideas that have arrived . &quot;
which has made India happen the way it is today .
The second set of ideas I call &quot; ideas in progress . &quot;
The third set of ideas are what I call as
And the fourth thing , which I believe is most important , is
in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having ,
Now in India &apos;s case I believe there are six ideas
which are responsible for where it has come today .
of looking at people as something of a burden
has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset .
fertility rates start dropping . And India is experiencing that .
a lot of young people with a demographic dividend
is that India will be the only country in the world
In other words , it will be the only young country in an aging world .
And this is very important . At the same time
if you peel away the demographic dividend in India ,
One is in the south and in the west of India ,
which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,
because in that part of the country , the fertility rate is
almost equal to that of a West European country .
which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend .
they have roads to go to work , they have lights to study at night --
only in those cases can you really get the benefit
In other words , if you don &apos;t really invest in the human capital ,
The second thing in India has been the change in
as a bad lot , as people who would exploit .
But today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship ,
The third big thing I believe that has changed India
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists .
with outsourcing , English has become a language of aspiration .
This has made it something that everybody wants to learn .
And the fact that we have English is now becoming
as something which was forbidding , something which was intimidating ,
are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge .
They didn &apos;t want the unions to believe that they were actually computers .
And when they wanted to have more advanced , more powerful computers
So we have come a long way from those days
where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment ,
and really has changed the way Indians think of technology .
Again , after having lived for more than 200 years
under the East India Company and under imperial rule ,
as Indians come and work all over the world ,
and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in .
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor ,
because we are the only young country in an aging world ,
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy
because they wanted to bring in the idea of
universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
the rise of the notion of population as human capital ,
the rise of English as a language of aspiration ,
then we come to what I call as ideas in progress .
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society ,
but you are not able to implement those things .
For some reason , whatever reason -- lack of money ,
lack of priorities , because of religion having an older culture --
primary education was never given the focus it required .
more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools .
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work .
But having said that , there is an enormous desire
among everybody , including the poor , to educate their children .
for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority .
Those of you who have been to India have seen that .
which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
20 years back the political slogan was , &quot; Roti , kapada , makaan , &quot;
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived ,
therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city .
For a long time we have neglected our cities .
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see .
And I think now you &apos;re seeing the move towards improving our cities .
Again , an idea which is arrived , but not yet implemented .
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --
because when you didn &apos;t think of India as a market ,
you didn &apos;t really bother about a single market , because it didn &apos;t really matter .
where every state had its own market for products .
are moving towards creating India as a single market .
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening ,
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict .
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock .
What are those ideas ? One is , I think , are ideological issues .
Because of the historical Indian background , in the caste system ,
and because of the fact that there have been many people
a lot of the politics is about how to make sure
It &apos;s also related to the way that we subsidize our people ,
and all the left and right arguments that we have .
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved .
The second one is the labor policies that we have ,
They have no benefits : they don &apos;t have social security ;
they don &apos;t have pension ; they don &apos;t have healthcare ; none of those things .
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people
you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised .
Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws ,
which are not as onerous as they are today .
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector ,
and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for .
It &apos;s very difficult for a foreign university to come to India .
That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address .
Here India can look at what is happening in the west
and elsewhere , and look at what needs to be done .
We can use technology for transparency , and many other things .
health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue ,
the higher state of diabetes , the higher state of obesity .
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases
Therefore we &apos;re to rethink the whole way we look at health .
We really need to put in place a strategy
so that we don &apos;t go to the other extreme of health .
the cost of social security , the cost of Medicare , the cost of Medicaid .
again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system
so that you don &apos;t create entitlement problems as you grow old .
And then again , India does not have the luxury
Just to give an idea , the world has to stabilize
our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year .
But if India grows at something like eight percent ,
income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050 .
So we &apos;re saying : income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon .
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment ,
the way we create whole new paradigms of development .
Why does what &apos;s happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ?
that you can have a democracy , that you can have an open society ,
you can solve the problems of poverty in the world .
you need it to solve the world &apos;s environment problems .
If we really want to come to a point ,
we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission ,
we want to really lower the use of energy --
it has to be solved in countries like India .
the average growth may have been about two percent .
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent .
When India was growing at about three , 3.5 percent
its per capita income was doubling every 45 years .
then per capita income is doubling every nine years .
In other words , you &apos;re certainly fast-forwarding this whole process
which is important for India and important for the world .
should be equally concerned with it as I am .
how the will to survive can bring that out in people .
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest ;
it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest .
And when it occurred , I was the only doctor on the mountain .
I &apos;ve been there six times : Four times I did work with National Geographic ,
There &apos;s only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level .
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour .
which is lower than a summer day on Mars .
I remember one time being up near the summit ,
only to discover that the water was already frozen solid .
That gives you an idea of just how severe
which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it &apos;s dwarfed by Everest .
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet .
It &apos;s the highest point you can bring your yaks
we built our camps all the way up the mountain .
it &apos;s a waterfall , but it &apos;s frozen , but it moves very slowly ,
When you &apos;re in it , you &apos;re like a rat in a maze ;
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen .
That way , it &apos;s less likely to tumble down on you .
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up .
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached .
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more ,
after you get up to the top of the icefall .
And from there we climb up to Camp Two ,
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile ,
it &apos;s about a 45 degree angle . It takes two days to climb it ,
If you notice , the summit of Everest is black .
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four ,
Once you get to Camp Four , you have maybe 24 hours
to decide if you &apos;re going to go for the summit or not .
and you either have to go up or go down ,
He was the leader of the New Zealand team .
This is a radio he used later to call his wife
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit .
They &apos;re up at Camp Four , and you can see that there &apos;s wind blowing off the summit .
so the climbers are just waiting , hoping that the wind &apos;s going to die down .
And , in fact , the wind does die down at night .
It becomes very calm , there &apos;s no wind at all .
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit .
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit
It &apos;s done in the dark , because it &apos;s actually less steep than what comes next ,
and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark .
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge .
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating .
This is a picture of me in that area
and you can see I &apos;ve got an oxygen mask on
You can see on this climber , we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --
This is all you &apos;ve got . You &apos;re very exposed on the summit ridge .
OK , this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself .
the drop off is so sheer on either side
you &apos;d wind up just pulling them off with you .
If you fall to your left , you &apos;re going to fall
But , either way , you fall for the rest of your life .
along that summit ridge that you see up there ,
while these guys were up there in the storm .
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay ,
to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain .
We were in radio contact with some of them .
This is a view taken along the summit ridge .
was up here , at this point in the storm
He was exhausted , and Rob was staying with him .
We also got some bad news in the storm
They were lost . There was total confusion on the mountain ;
all the stories were confusing , most of them were conflicting .
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm .
decided to go up to try to rescue who they could
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall ,
and just try to save yourself at this point . &quot;
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge , up in here ,
and it was a scene of complete chaos up there .
But they did what they could to stabilize the people .
and we sent down the climbers that could make it down
The ones that couldn &apos;t we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four .
So the climbers were coming down along this route .
This is taken from Camp Three , where I was .
so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them ,
I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition
The ones that weren &apos;t that lucid or were not that well coordinated ,
where they could then work their way further down the mountain .
It &apos;s so awkward to work up there that sometimes
I even gave the injections right through their clothes .
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him .
He called in to say that he was alone now .
Apparently , Doug had died higher up on the mountain .
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself ,
and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude ,
and Rob asked to be patched into her . That was done ,
and that was the last we ever heard of him .
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients
So what we did was , we got the victims
down to 21,000 feet , where it was easier for me to treat them .
which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp .
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could ,
put oxygen on them and try to revive them ,
just like a mummy , he walked into the tent .
but , in fact , he walked into the tent and said to me ,
So he was completely lucid , but he was very severely frostbitten .
First , it turns white , and then when it &apos;s completed necrosis ,
he related what had been going on up there .
He said he had gotten lost in the storm ,
Some climbers had come by and looked at him ,
but couldn &apos;t even blink to indicate that he was alive .
and Beck lay there for a day , a night
After laying in the snow that long a time ,
he got up and found his way back to the camp .
Just very simply , the three parts of the brain :
So let &apos;s take a cut through the brain here ,
and the posterior portion , where the maintenance functions are in the back .
Now , you go to this one and you see how much more
He &apos;s not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point ,
He &apos;s trying to get his muscles going and get out of this .
It &apos;s too cold ; he can &apos;t keep his metabolic fires going ,
He &apos;s collapsed in the snow here . Everything is quiet ,
you can see that the middle part of his brain
And this is how he &apos;s going to turn thought
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus .
This is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower .
He &apos;s going to develop enough energy in that area --
after a day , a night and a day --
he &apos;s starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe .
He &apos;s thinking about what he &apos;s got to do to save himself .
to think about what he has to do to get himself going .
He &apos;s not thinking about his family now , and he &apos;s getting himself motivated .
This is the posterior part , where his muscles are going to be moving ,
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed .
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on
had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet ,
and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do .
He was critically ill , there were other critically ill patients ;
and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history .
It was able to land on the ice , take away Beck
and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks
turning to the mountain , actually , to talk to them directly .
because he was able to generate that incredible willpower ,
he was able to use all the power of his mind
the message will be carried up to the gods ,
Three years ago , I got a phone call , based on an earlier film I had made ,
with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard .
My idea -- and literally , I woke up in the middle of the night ,
and we &apos;ve all have those moments . You know , you go to sleep --
I was thinking , I just finished making another film about World War II vets ,
and I realized I &apos;d gotten to know their stories ,
So I went to bed that night pretty excited .
It wasn &apos;t at four in the morning , but it was closer to midnight .
And I had this idea : what if I could , in effect , virtually embed ,
To tell the story from the inside out , versus the outside in ?
who &apos;s the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard .
And he knew me , so I was like , &quot; Greg ? &quot;
he is one of the bravest men in the world ,
as is General Blair , who , in the end , gave me permission to try this experiment .
Within 10 days , I was down at Fort Dix .
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company , Third of the 172nd ,
Number two , they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda ,
The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer .
I wasn &apos;t really totally gathering what that would mean .
So what that meant was , when I went down to Fort Dix ,
I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision .
You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got .
&quot; What the fuck do you know about the National Guard ? &quot;
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars .
So , I &apos;d like to show the clip of the film .
It &apos;s our trailer , because I know , obviously you guys are busy ,
many of you may not have had a chance to see it .
and then I &apos;m going to take apart one scene in detail .
Zack Bazzi : Do I really want to go ? Probably not .
Soldier : We &apos;re not supposed to talk to the media .
Soldier : Bring it on ! Narrator : You ready ? Voice 2 : Iraq , here we come !
ZB : Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat .
then you &apos;re not going to be doing your job .
MM : Every single time you go out there , there &apos;s attacks .
ZB : Hey , Nestor , your ass crack is right in my face .
Michael Moriarty &apos;s Wife : It &apos;s really hard for him to not have his dad .
MM : This little kid is in the middle of a war zone .
Stephen Pink &apos;s Girlfriend : In the beginning , he &apos;s like , &quot; Write something dirty ! &quot;
Soldier : We &apos;ve got a drive through window at Burger King now .
MM : I support George Bush . We &apos;re not there for the oil .
Michael Moriarty &apos;s Wife : He &apos;s not the same person anymore .
Kevin Shangraw : The Iraqi people are who we are there to help --
Soldiers : Sergeant Smith is down ! Sergeant Smith is down ?
JB : It &apos;ll be a better country in 20 years , &apos; cause we were there .
One of the things I &apos;d like to talk to you about
is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about .
And I &apos;d like to relate an experience I had here at TED .
I don &apos;t know how many of you might imagine it ,
but there &apos;s actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq .
and I want to tell you a little , brief story .
to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software .
People will see my tag , and they &apos;ll see &quot; The War Tapes , &quot;
We got in a conversation with some other people in the class ,
I mean , we were there for an hour , talking .
And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask
you guys to think about and hopefully to help with ,
which is , I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war ,
And really -- because maybe we &apos;re going to disagree .
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ?
&quot; You know , I wouldn &apos;t have this conversation if she weren &apos;t here ,
I really related to what James was saying yesterday ,
You know , I can answer questions about my movie ,
but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time .
So , I wanted to say , Paul , I &apos;m happy you &apos;re here ,
but it could not have been made without it .
The guys &apos; tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me .
In the meantime , the soldiers -- we would email and IM .
that it would be something that I would want to keep track of .
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey
and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together .
SP : Today is sport . &#91; Unclear &#93; Radio : &#91; Unclear &#93; Christian soldiers .
SP : We like to give these insurgents a fair chance .
So , what we do , we ride with the windows down .
Because , you know , we obviously have the advantage . I &apos;m just kidding .
We don &apos;t fucking ride with the goddam windows down .
SP : All right , let &apos;s get over to that site .
We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji ,
we need you at the gate of Taji right now , over .
Probably 20 dead , at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis .
and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds .
and it was just like there was a void going through the body .
They just removed a burnt body , or half a body from here .
I don &apos;t think there was anything left from his abdominal down .
Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall , shaking and screaming .
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji .
They can work on the post for pennies , but can &apos;t die there .
If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment ,
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more
I feel exploited and proud at the same time .
a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of .
I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass .
and there won &apos;t be any time for jerking off tomorrow .
When I said earlier , to try and tell a story from the inside out , versus the outside in --
part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding .
It &apos;s a new way of trying to make a documentary .
When I met the guys , and 10 of them agreed to take cameras --
The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email ,
and in it , attached a photo of that burned body out at the car .
you know , it had been a very bad day , obviously .
And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base .
&quot; Mike , can you please go get that interview with Pink ? &quot;
Because the thing that very often is missing is ,
It &apos;s that immediate interview after something immediately happens , you know .
to share that experience with you , the guys --
there was a camera on the turret , the gun turret ,
Most of the Humvees , we ended up mounting two cameras in them .
So you get to experience that in real time , right ?
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did
I knew about that journal , but it was very , very private .
So , it wasn &apos;t until five months after he was home
Now , the news footage I put in there to try to show --
you know , I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can
But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times ,
&quot; Why don &apos;t they talk about the good stuff that we do ? &quot;
Pink &apos;s squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire .
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives --
And I think it &apos;s such an amazing gift that they would share this
And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q &amp; amp ; As ,
But it seems like people don &apos;t want to hear so much ,
And I &apos;m as fiery as the next person , but I really think --
you know , different speakers have talked about their concern for the world ,
and my concern is that we have to have these conversations .
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may , you know ,
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness , to know .
And for me , it &apos;s trying to bridge that disconnect .
I get -- I &apos;m often asked , you know , for me ,
what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film .
you know , as I &apos;m sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff --
usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions .
But there &apos;s always a few guys , almost always , who are the last ones .
And I &apos;ve learned over time that those are always the soldiers .
And for me , one of the most profound stories someone shared with me ,
for those of you who haven &apos;t seen the film , and it &apos;s not a spoiler --
it &apos;s very common there are a lot of civilian accidents ,
where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed .
In this film , there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed .
A soldier came up to me and stood , you know really , pretty close ,
and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .
And I knew what he was going to say .
I &apos;m afraid she &apos;s going to think I &apos;m a monster . &quot;
and I said , you know , &quot; It &apos;s going to be OK . &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring her to see your film .
it &apos;s not only for maybe those people who don &apos;t know a soldier ,
it &apos;s not like World War II , where there was a war front and a home front ,
You can go for days here and not feel like there &apos;s a war going on .
and they say , &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m against the war , but I support the soldiers . &quot;
Do you , if you find out your neighbor &apos;s been , do you spend some time ?
Not necessarily ask questions , but see if they want to talk ?
Do you give money to any of the charities ? &quot;
You know , obviously , like Dean Kamen &apos;s working on that amazing thing ,
but there &apos;s charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers .
to operationalize those terms , when we say we support someone , you know ?
And I would just say it &apos;s my hope , and I would ask you guys
Think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
This is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
Now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian originally ,
with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --
if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race ,
you take a budget , and you bet your budget
And if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
Now today , if you want to win the race ,
and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions
And basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components --
to be able to be sensed and to be actuated .
If we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s crust ,
but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --
So if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans
it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the Moses --
actually you can still see a small chip underneath --
our environment is starting to talk back to us .
again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
Well , the first project I wanted to share with you
is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
It was four and a half years ago in Italy .
was actually use a new type of network at the time
that had been deployed all across the world --
and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network ,
Some of you might remember , it was Italy and France playing ,
Halftime , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
Well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
The following day , again everybody went to the center
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo ,
to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
Well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today
all the chips that form a Mac computer , how they came together .
But we know very little about where things go .
to track trash as it moves through the system .
So we actually started with a number of volunteers
different types of things , as you can see here --
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
But there &apos;s a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening .
that the cup we &apos;re throwing away , it doesn &apos;t disappear ,
And the plastic bottle we &apos;re throwing away every day still stays there .
and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing ,
but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning ,
is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza , Spain .
It started with a question by the mayor of the city ,
that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition
And the question was : How could technology , new technology ,
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water .
And even you can approach it , and it will open up
And we got a commission to design a building
if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof .
You know , these days , you always get images during the winter ,
of people who have been there and said , &quot; They demolished the building . &quot;
No , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down ,
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
And here was myself trying not to get wet ,
Well , I should tell you now what happened one night
But actually that night , it was even more fun .
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building ,
because the way of engaging with the building became something different .
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in ,
but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water ,
we always think about how people will use the things we design .
with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water ,
And this is what led us to think about
and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --
almost as a cloud that can move in space .
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this --
control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
When you turn on the light , actually you see this . So the same as we saw before .
And imagine each of them then controlled by people .
I want to show you something here for the first time .
in order to use it as an input for Flyfire .
But then , once we have the pixels , then you can play with them
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
It &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the London Olympics .
almost to impart what we call cloud raising --
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel .
that has happened over the past couple of years
we went from the physical world to the digital one .
we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
So the idea that we can actually involve people
The cloud is a cloud , again , made of pixels ,
It &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pixels .
You can move inside , have different types of experiences .
and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; ,
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --
a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
But anyway , this is about the evils of science , so I think it &apos;s perfect .
? My oh my , walking by , who &apos;s the apple of my eye ? ?
? Oh , if I should stroll the hood , who knew I could look so good ?
? just talking on the phone to Clonie . ?
? We are pals , it &apos;s cool , &apos; cause we &apos;re not lonely , ?
? shallow gene pool is nothing to my only Clonie . ?
? Me and you , hustling through , holding on through thick and thin , ?
? just day by day , our DNA , so the Olson twins got nothing on us . ?
? We &apos;ll survive , side by side . Mother Nature , don &apos;t you call her phony , she &apos;s my Clonie . ?
? Was wealthy , but not healthy , had no one to dwell with me , ?
? so look who I got born -- Clonie . ?
? Far from broke , bored , rich folk , we don &apos;t need no natural yolk -- ?
? and show them , be the most lovable thing since fucking Eminem . ?
? Oh my friend , multiply , we閳ユ獧e a franchise , like Walt Disney or Hannibal Lecter . ?
? We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector . ?
? We閳ユ獟l survive side by side , should have signed with Verve instead of Sony . ?
? You閳ユ獧e my Clonie . ? &quot; Oh Clonie , how I love you . &quot;
? Gee , that &apos;s swell . I guess you &apos;re just my fatal attraction-ie . You閳ユ獧e my Clonie . ?
This is , obviously , that famous view now of the Arctic ,
which is likely to be gone at this point
in the next three or four or five years . Very , very , very scary .
So we all look at what we can do .
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea .
So it was a big idea . We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent ,
There is the inside of our lab . We haven &apos;t shown this before .
different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets .
So then we went forward and built our production line in China .
We don &apos;t build this production equipment any longer in the U.S. , unfortunately .
You &apos;re seeing for the first time , a brand new drywall production line ,
We got our first panel out on December third .
That is the slurry being poured onto paper , basically . That &apos;s the line running .
The exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people .
These are people who worked this project for two to three years .
And they are so excited . That &apos;s the first board off the line .
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board . Obviously very , very excited .
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony ,
leading to people hopefully using these products across the world .
We happened to win , just recently , the Green Product of the Year
So here is what we learned : 8,000 gallons of gas
You probably had no idea . It &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to lick this problem .
Don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can .
And these job losses , we can fix them with green-collar jobs .
We &apos;ve got four plants . We &apos;re building this stuff around the country .
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum ,
&quot; Hey , you gave it a good shot . You did the best you could
So my hope is that when you leave TED ,
And if you don &apos;t know how , please find me -- I will help you .
Last but not least , Bill Gates , I know you invented Windows .
Wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented .
I &apos;ve been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel
for some of you , you can empathize with that number .
This is a setup I put in a physics lab .
We need to reach a target inside the brain .
Okay , so let &apos;s talk a little bit about ultrasound ,
of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain
When I was born , this idea was already conceived
that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain ,
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system .
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery
So we put the patient on the MR table .
We attach a transducer , in this case , to the brain ,
it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .
but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?
This is the sort of general area of the treatment .
you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is --
This is the only device he needs in this treatment .
So he presses &quot; sonicate , &quot; and this is what happens .
There &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
This is really a unique capability of the MR.
both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .
And you can see the points there on the graph .
But the point is we are right on target .
that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen ,
If you do it for more than a second ,
This is the outcome from a patient perspective --
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it .
And his wife said , &quot; This is the happiest moment of my life . &quot;
I mean , one of the messages I like to carry over
It &apos;s like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
And people are suffering from all kinds of pain
who suffered from -- how should I say it ? --
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
The good news : there &apos;s a lot that can be done .
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
or something that is a national goal to make that happen ,
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
But I have a message for the men here .
Well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen --
is you have to teach the MR some tricks
But I have now a message to the ladies .
And sometimes , they cannot even conceive and become pregnant
for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure
And in 2010 , she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby .
I &apos;d like to leave you with actually four messages .
and I think also from their physicians , by the way .
And the other thing I would like you to think about
&#91; who &#93; is awake and can even monitor the treatment .
She &apos;s rooting around , she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --
She &apos;s looking at the seams . She &apos;s looking at the construction .
She said , &quot; I &apos;ll buy it , but I &apos;m also going to replicate it . &quot;
that she can root through the history of fashion
that doesn &apos;t need to be changed by one iota ,
that this is illegal for her to do this .
Well , it turns out that it &apos;s actually not illegal .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s a lot harder for knock-off artists
Now , the reason for this , the reason that the fashion industry
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve
But too utilitarian ? I mean is that the way you think of fashion ?
Now , those of you who are familiar with the logic
which is that without ownership , there is no incentive to innovate --
by both the critical success of the fashion industry
They &apos;re also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist .
I &apos;ve heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes
People think this is a magical thing . How does it happen ?
Well , it &apos;s because it &apos;s legal for people to copy one another .
there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain
who sort of dictate to us what we &apos;re all going to wear ,
but if you talk to any designer at any level ,
where people like you and me remix and match
And that &apos;s where they really get a lot of their
so it &apos;s both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry .
And they &apos;ve been faced with a lot of lawsuits ,
but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers .
The courts have said over and over again , &quot; You don &apos;t need
If you can get it for 200 bucks , why pay a thousand ?
Well , that &apos;s one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago .
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci ,
that -- actually not much research , quite simple research --
And , you know , a knock-off is never the same
at least in terms of the materials ; they &apos;re always made of cheaper materials .
can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend .
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to
of design choices to choose from than we ever have before ,
and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry , actually .
And this is a good thing . We need lots of options .
helps you project who you are to the world .
global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to .
They don &apos;t want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .
And so , they want to move on to the next trend
I tell you , there is no rest for the fashionable .
to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody &apos;s going to love .
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer .
He has complained a lot about people copying him ,
he said it has really forced him to up his game .
that has to be made out of steel or titanium ;
if you make it from some sort of cheaper material ,
It forced him to be a little more innovative .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard this anecdote , but I have .
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop
that white musicians wouldn &apos;t be able to replicate the sound .
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy ,
and that &apos;s what fashion designers are doing all the time .
because they &apos;ve put that look out on the runway ,
But now , we have a different kind of comic .
much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer ,
Now , the other thing that fashion designers have done
and they come up with a way to sell their product
&quot; It &apos;s only in the United States that we don &apos;t have any respect .
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world ,
In Japan , for instance , which I think is the third largest market ,
you have to prove that your garment has never existed before ,
In the European Union , they went in the other direction .
But even though it &apos;s the home of the fast fashion industry
and you have a lot of luxury designers there ,
It turns out it &apos;s because the novelty standard is too low .
A person can come in and take somebody else &apos;s gown ,
go to the E.U. and register it as a new , original design .
a lot of the registered things in the E.U.
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though .
and something that &apos;s just part of a global trend .
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time ,
and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive .
There &apos;s a bunch of other industries that don &apos;t have copyright protection ,
It doesn &apos;t matter how wacky they look or how cool they look ,
Magic tricks , I think they &apos;re instructions , sort of like recipes :
Tattoo artists , they don &apos;t want it ; it &apos;s not cool .
So you talk to people in the fashion industry
and it &apos;s a model that a lot of other industries --
like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --
Because right now , those industries with a lot of copyright protection
where it &apos;s as if they don &apos;t have any protection ,
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries
I want a picture . &quot; And the lawyers do not provide a picture ,
sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law .
It is more complex than this , but this will do .
and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ?
And these things , because we can copy and transmit them so easily ,
and , let me tell you , we don &apos;t want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out .
trying to figure out : What is the kind of ownership model ,
If you want more information about this research project ,
each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end
that you could actually stand on top of it .
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile ,
It also happens to be a relative of parsley .
in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time
because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero
What you &apos;re looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi ,
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project .
and knew that I had to go visit it .
It wasn &apos;t until later , when I was actually back home in New York
So it was the slow churn , if you will .
I was surprised to find that there isn &apos;t even an area in the sciences
which is a long way to go for some lichens .
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
One was when I had been dropped off by boat
only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet
And it &apos;s not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail ,
so I was literally left to my own devices .
we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream
and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands .
And if the title &quot; Searching for Armillaria Death Rings , &quot;
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus ,
So I &apos;m not sure if there are any in this photo ,
but I do know the fungus is down there .
and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree .
So this strategy has served it pretty well --
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .
And you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s some damage to the surface of the coral .
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish
Luckily still , it seems to be out of harm &apos;s way
But that being said , we just as easily could have lost
one of the oldest living things on the planet ,
is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree ,
and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center
As it &apos;s gotten warmer on the top of the mountain ,
because I &apos;m often asked if there are any animals in the project .
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is --
to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state
it &apos;s highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild .
So as you can see , it &apos;s in a churchyard ;
And there are actually a number or ancient yews
it &apos;s actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
And now down to another part of the world .
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa
And you know , I think of all of these organisms
and they also contain records of natural and human events .
tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out .
And this brings me to another favorite of mine --
and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola ,
to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea .
You &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s bearing cones down the center .
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves ,
you see that there are a number of petrified forests ,
and yet there &apos;s no sign of where they might have come from .
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things .
So , I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden ,
which is dry and prone to a lot of fires ,
is , if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree ,
and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface .
Back in the U.S. , there &apos;s a couple plants of similar age .
but that being said , you see that this has
And it &apos;s one -- again , that interconnected root system ,
This is the clonal Mojave yucca , it &apos;s about a mile away ,
and it &apos;s a little bit older than 12,000 years .
And you see it has that similar circular form .
And both of these , the yucca and the Creosote bush ,
and that &apos;s very different from being protected in a national park .
So , now I want to show what very well might be
hoping to find clues to life on other planets
by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours .
And what they found , by doing research into the permafrost ,
And what that means is that it &apos;s not dormant --
This is a map that I &apos;ve put together of the oldest living things ,
so you can get a sense of where they are ; you see they &apos;re all over the world .
The blue flags represent things that I &apos;ve already photographed ,
and the reds are places that I &apos;m still trying to get to .
So , I probably have about two more years left
I really feel like I know what &apos;s at the heart of this work .
at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean .
and they can &apos;t just get up and get out of the way .
It &apos;s my hope that , by going to find these organisms ,
so the government could track where text was coming from .
if you go and buy a color laser printer
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
And this is one of the main three sources
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world ,
we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it
I asked one of the leaders of the team
Now we all , or a big part of us ,
because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
all the communication of the citizens of the country .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case ,
well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
any right we give away will be given away for good .
that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
and everywhere I &apos;m finding that I hear similar themes .
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .
They say , &quot; I really want to follow a life of purpose ,
I don &apos;t want to disappoint my family or friends . &quot;
And they say , &quot; I want to work in global poverty ,
And as a woman who didn &apos;t get married until I was a lot older --
and I say , &quot; Your job is not to be perfect .
she talks about a white woman in the 1950s
and she looks at her child with a sense of pride ,
at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation
and they would look at them , holding them as stewards
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other ,
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that ,
we would leave a chair empty for her spirit .
whether in Trenton , New Jersey or the office of the White House ,
they all say that they &apos;re trying to integrate her wisdom
women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia .
and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals ,
there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living .
And the women , who I was so privileged to meet
hoping that others were alive and doing the same .
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage ,
but she never lifted her hands to move them .
not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already ,
is sometimes the most important things that we do
and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power
And though she had been part of building a liberal party ,
about three months before the genocide , she switched parties
and was known for inciting men to kill faster
and to make us look at other beings , human beings ,
I &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet
while it is so critical that we invest in our girls
we have to remember that the girls and the women
And that , when they sit on those street corners
and all they can think of in the future
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization ,
the ability to put yourself in another person &apos;s shoes
And he &apos;s been working with this young group of men
who come from the largest slum in the world , Kibera .
and they &apos;re reading many TED authors and liking it .
and we invest what we call patient capital --
money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years ,
and when we get it back , we invest in other innovations
We &apos;ve invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies ,
and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars
because we don &apos;t see profit as a blunt instrument .
And ultimately , we want to be part of a movement
And my dream is we &apos;ll have a world one day
where we don &apos;t just honor those who take money
but we find those individuals who take our resources
because they created more hatred , more rage , more fear
he studied real estate , worked in commercial real estate ,
and after 9 / 11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference .
For two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny stipend ,
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community
It took almost two years just to register the land .
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise
&quot; How do you guys navigate ? This is a really diverse community .
but ultimately the leaders of the community came together ,
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage
sometimes dreams of a past that never really was ,
Or we can take the much more difficult path
of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles ,
during the Civil Rights movement in the United States .
about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges ,
the first child to desegregate schools in the South --
and it looked like she was talking to the people .
And he would say , &quot; Ruby , what are you saying ? &quot;
And finally he said , &quot; Ruby , I see that you &apos;re talking .
And she said , &quot; Dr. Coles , I am not talking ;
that all of us should have access to education .
My final story is about a young , beautiful man
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya ,
And he said to me at the end of his year ,
because I thought as a farmer and as an African
But especially when I was talking to the African women ,
it was so hard for me to learn how to listen . &quot;
And he said , &quot; So I conclude that , in many ways ,
to every man , woman and child on this planet .
And we need to have the humility to recognize
that &quot; few of us have the greatness to bend history itself ,
And it is in the total of all those acts
that the history of this generation will be written .
but in the end , it is all that will sustain us .
Let &apos;s look for a minute at the greatest icon of all , Leonardo da Vinci .
but there &apos;s controversy , and it remains , about his looks .
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn &apos;t it ?
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
He drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything .
His contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here --
I think that if we were to scan all of his work
and look for self-portraits , we would find his face looking at us .
So I looked at all of his drawings , more than 700,
Well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters .
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized .
that Leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man .
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures .
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill .
as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus .
And lastly , the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted , &quot; The Musician . &quot;
I should explain why I have some right to talk about them .
for newspapers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only .
But there are 1,100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces .
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces .
And hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces ,
remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows ,
the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well-developed chin .
I couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when I first saw that .
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait ,
And as you see here from the years that they were created ,
What was the age of Leonardo at the time ? Does that fit ?
Yes , it does . He was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made .
So we have three pictures , potentially of the same person
of the same age as Leonardo at the time .
But how do we know it &apos;s him , and not someone else ?
And here &apos;s the only picture of Leonardo that &apos;s widely accepted .
for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15 .
And if we now compare the face of the statue ,
with the face of the musician , you see the very same features again .
The statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of Leonardo
Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
It &apos;s only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first .
This machine , which we all have residing in our skulls ,
to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull .
And it &apos;s constructed for change . It &apos;s all about change .
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can &apos;t do today ,
The last time you were in the presence of a baby --
despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing
on the basis of her experiences in the womb --
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities , they would be crude .
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on .
In fact there is little evidence that there is any
There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board .
And they can only in a very primitive way , and in a very limited way
could do something as simple as reach out and grasp
And yet , when we look forward in the brain
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands ,
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities .
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills .
And by this age there is absolutely no question
that this brain , it has a person on board .
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development .
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head .
And where this boy comes from , Sao Paulo , Brazil ,
about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability .
You could go out into the community in Monterey ,
and you &apos;d have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability .
And if you did he &apos;d probably be from Sao Paulo .
is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities
in the way that , in fact , no two of us
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities
In an adult brain of course we &apos;ve built up
that we can perform more or less automatically from memory ,
and that define us as acting , moving , thinking creatures .
as the nerdy , laboratory , university-based scientists that we are ,
one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth --
to engage them in learning new skills and abilities .
And we try to track the changes that occur
The first great epoch is commonly called the &quot; Critical Period . &quot;
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up
in which it doesn &apos;t take learning , per se , to drive
the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain .
All it takes for example in the sound domain ,
of the sound environment in which it is reared .
in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound ,
And what I see is that the animal &apos;s brain sets up
in a form that &apos;s idealized , within the limits of its processing achievements
to represent it in an organized and orderly way .
The sound doesn &apos;t have to be valuable to the animal :
I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable ,
the sounds of a native language of a child .
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized --
specialized for that complex array , a repertoire of sounds .
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound .
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain
to be a master processor for that meaningless sound .
the brain actually changes outside of a learning context .
I don &apos;t have to be paying attention to what I hear .
I don &apos;t have to be in a behavioral context .
This is required so the brain sets up it &apos;s processing
so that the creature that wears it , that carries it ,
can begin to operate on it in a selective way .
In the next great epoch of life , which applies for most of life ,
as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities .
which extends from late in the first year of life to death ;
It &apos;s a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved
or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior .
You can look down in the brain of an animal
and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels .
in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence
It &apos;s a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained
in a task that involves it manipulating a tool
to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon .
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all .
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails .
He &apos;s successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time .
very beautifully regulated and highly repeated , trial to trial .
We can look down in the brain of the monkey .
We can track these changes , and have tracked these changes
reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey .
Now this is a map , down in the surface of the brain ,
in which , in a very elaborate experiment we &apos;ve reconstructed the responses ,
in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons .
And that is indicated in the pink . We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger .
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .
we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics
In other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fingertips
of the surface of the skin of the body .
And yet now it &apos;s represented in substantially finer grain .
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected , maybe , by you --
Now actually we &apos;ve looked in several different cortical areas
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific
So for example we can look to the cortical area
that represents input that &apos;s controlling the posture of the monkey .
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements ,
that are required in the behavior , and so forth .
They are all remodeled . They all become specialized for the task at hand .
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically
And that represents in your brain , really massive change .
possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain .
And the level of construction that occurs is massive .
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child
through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .
Because in most of the life of the brain
That is why you , in your many skills and abilities ,
than the brain of an individual 100 years ago ;
from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago .
Now , one of the characteristics of this change process
And that &apos;s because the brain is constructing representations of things
and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time .
or yourself as the actor , yourself as the thinker ,
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in
that are always associated with you as the receiver ,
And it &apos;s created in the brain via physical change .
because each one of us has vastly different histories ,
that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self ,
to try to understand not just how a normal person develops ,
that might limit the capacities of a child , or an adult .
approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child
And I &apos;m going to talk about experiments that involve
first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age .
And then , by using it in a targeted approach
So the first example I &apos;m going to talk about
and that are going to struggle to learn to read ,
And the reason that it rises in a defective form
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that .
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know
that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively ;
we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities ;
and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read .
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures .
We don &apos;t hear about that anymore . Where did it go ?
that if you simply fix the problem early enough ,
when the brain is still in this initial plastic period
in this initial set up time in the critical period ,
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it ?
the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears ,
The child &apos;s native language is such a case is not English .
Now the crap doesn &apos;t just happen in the ear .
The brain itself can be noisy . It &apos;s commonly noisy .
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier .
And the native language for a child with such a brain
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words --
by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants .
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants .
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits
Of course they will . Because as a receiver of language ,
And they are going to have poor reading skills .
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds
If you don &apos;t have a brain representation of word sounds
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology .
in their operations in language , and their operations in reading --
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this .
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine
Changing it in detail . It takes about 30 hours on the average .
And we &apos;ve accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today .
Actually , probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak .
And actually when you look at the impacts , the impacts are substantial .
What we &apos;re most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution .
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities .
The impact in the distribution , if you trained every child
in the United States , would be to shift the whole distribution to the right
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts .
Think of the children on the slow side of the class .
We have the potential to move most of those children
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training --
And to a large extent it fixes the brain .
You can look down in the brain of a child
in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford ,
and MIT , and UCSF , and UCLA , and a number of other institutions .
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual
and witness a change in the time constants and space constants
with which , for example , the brain is representing language again .
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning ,
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual --
this is a small population of such individuals --
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory ,
of their ability to remember things after a delay ,
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution ,
It means that most people who are at risk for senility ,
My issues are to try to get to rescuing
because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale --
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies .
is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine .
in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
Get ready for it . It &apos;s going to be a part of every life
is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period .
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this
literature and the science that is important to you
is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself .
Now that you know , now that science is telling us
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice .
It will be a long time before they really understand it .
across the most northern place in the whole world .
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father .
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment .
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy
He had been there and watched it go off .
And he said that the explosion was so loud
that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .
And he said that he could actually see an x-ray
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off
had a very , very big impact on my late father .
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me
and show me just how fragile the world is .
He loved history . He would tell me about Captain Scott
And so ever since I think I was just six years old ,
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic .
But seven years ago , I went to the Arctic
And it was so beautiful that I &apos;ve been back there
I have seen polar bears walking across very , very thin ice
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there .
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders
at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over ,
And we need to do something about it right now .
27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool .
This morning , the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees .
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7 .
I &apos;m sorry , but there is no other way to describe it .
And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport ,
you just dive into the sea and off you go .
It couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
And I then went and did a huge amount of training ,
But the most important thing was to train my mind
to prepare myself for what was going to happen .
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
I had to see my coach screaming for me ,
&quot; Come on Lewis ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Don &apos;t slow down ! &quot;
And so I literally swam across the North Pole
And then , after a year of training , I felt ready .
So myself and the five members of the team ,
And on day four , we decided to just do a quick
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before ,
I could barely breathe . I was gasping for air .
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes .
I remember just trying to get out of the water .
And I remember taking the goggles off my face
and looking down at my hands in sheer shock ,
had swollen so much that they were like sausages .
And they were swollen so much , I couldn &apos;t even close them .
What had happened is that we are made partially of water ,
that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
And they had burst . And I was in so much agony .
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower .
And I thought , in two days &apos; time , I was going to do this swim across the North Pole .
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim ,
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy
with my father , was just going out the window .
There is no possibility that this was going to happen .
And I remember then getting out of the shower
And for a swimmer , you need to feel your hands
because you need to be able to grab the water
and I was in such a state of depression ,
and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes .
For those of you who don &apos;t know him , he &apos;s the great British explorer .
A number of years ago , he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole .
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
He went to a local hospital and there they said ,
We are going to actually have to take them off . &quot;
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed
And all I could think of was , if that happened to Ran after three minutes ,
and I can &apos;t feel my hands after five minutes ,
what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes ?
At the very best , I &apos;m going to end up losing some fingers .
And at worst , I didn &apos;t even want to think about it .
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole .
And my close friend David , he saw the way I was thinking ,
and he came up to me and he said , &quot; Lewis ,
I &apos;ve known you since you were 18 years old .
I so believe in you Lewis . I &apos;ve seen the way you &apos;ve been training .
And I realize the reason why you &apos;re going to do this .
We stand at a very , very important moment in this history ,
and you &apos;re going to make a symbolic swim here
to try to shake the lapels of world leaders .
because we are going to look after you every moment of it . &quot;
And I just , I got so much confidence from him saying that ,
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole .
and it was just as the scientists had predicted .
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor ,
and there were big chunks of white ice in there ,
And I said to myself , &quot; Lewis , don &apos;t look left , don &apos;t look right .
And so I now want to show you a short video
Narrator : We &apos;re just sailing out of harbor now , and it &apos;s at this stage
when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally .
A mother and a cub , such a beautiful sight .
months and months and months of dreaming to get here ,
Ooh . In a couple of hours &apos; time I &apos;m going to get in here and do my swim .
Lewis Pugh : Ten seconds to swim . Ten seconds to swim .
Well done lad ! You did it ! You did it Lewis !
Man : Against the current ! You did it against the current !
LP : Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
LP : I &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this :
It took me four months again to feel my hands .
But was it worth it ? Yes , absolutely it was .
There are very , very few people who don &apos;t know now
And people ask me , &quot; Lewis , what can we do about climate change ? &quot;
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down
every single country is going to have to make cuts .
All of us together , we &apos;re all on the same ship together .
I remember , just a few years ago , speaking about climate change ,
I &apos;ve just come back from giving a series of speeches
in some of the poorest townships in South Africa
to young children as young as 10 years old .
is , I think , we must all walk to the end of our lives
and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .
And that is , &quot; What type of world do we want to live in ,
and what decision are we going to make today
For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy ,
and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a varied talk .
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
you put them together in exactly the right way
into a number of very useful products and fuels .
there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world .
But this is it , this is the oil in the world .
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
still to be developed and produced in the world today .
But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that .
Oh , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil ,
is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world .
Come talk to me about it , I &apos;ll fill in some of the details if you want .
So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it .
But what about oil ? Where is it in the energy system ?
Here &apos;s a little snapshot of 150 years of oil ,
and it &apos;s been a dominant part of our energy system
Now , here &apos;s another little secret I &apos;m going to tell you about :
oil has been playing less and less of a role
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985,
when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply .
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
And what &apos;s been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?
Well , I think out ahead of us a few decades
Now , I &apos;m not pretending that energy use in total
that &apos;s another part of the story . Come talk to me about it ,
Now that might be the end of the story --
Okay , we just replace it all with conventional renewables --
but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that .
And to tell the next part of the story --
and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond .
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas .
And it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
I picked this up at MIT . It &apos;s a little younger .
And it &apos;s different than this limestone , you can see that .
You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff ,
and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this .
Yeah , it &apos;s very different -- no , it &apos;s not different .
What &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
Oh , by the way , just in case you weren &apos;t already guessing ,
Now , what does this have to do with energy ?
Nature didn &apos;t need to because , unlike the abalone shell ,
So , when we think about the future of energy ,
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a bajillion windmills .
that will end the age of oil , long before we run out of oil .
and the other one is the small , and very limited ,
in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment ,
in the area of exploitation of women and children ,
in all the areas in which we really need
but in general , I thought , &quot; We need a system
in which they said , &quot; You are not allowed to do this .
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries .
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank ,
and many of them like to be in Nairobi --
but they like to be there because the other cities
one of the most vulnerable , and one of the most beautiful ,
It had no clients , nobody would buy the electricity there ,
So everybody knew this is a , not a useless project ,
this is an absolute damaging , a terrible project --
not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country
and it was the first project to be implemented .
The good projects , which we as a donor community
for thousands of families who had to be resettled --
or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
No , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars
more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line ,
The cause of this is , to a large extent ,
after I left , under a big fight , the World Bank .
The reason was that the members of the World Bank
we will lose to the Swedes , we &apos;ll lose to the Japanese . &quot;
And therefore , there was a indeed a prisoner &apos;s dilemma ,
&quot; We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad . &quot;
at a good price , so they are very competitive .
We had here in Berlin , at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee ,
In the first session -- we had three sessions
&quot; This is not bribery , what we are doing . &quot; This is customary there .
And so there are still a lot of people
who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing .
they admitted already that they would never do this ,
here in Germany , or in the U.K. , and so on .
And in the final session , at the Aspen Institute ,
That &apos;s why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in
and that &apos;s why MIN is in the trouble they are in .
to one particular official of one particular friendly country ,
This case , they are not prosecuting in the UK .
is trying to get a solution to this problem ,
and also in Japan , which is not properly enforcing ,
you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant ,
and the members of our parliament don &apos;t want to change this ,
which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world ,
They have to have a much more participatory governance
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders .
This is why we have set up the governance school
and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin ,
But what I &apos;m saying from my very practical experience :
for all of us to create a better world .
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives , but that &apos;s it .
And so I &apos;m not going to talk about the painted portrait today .
I &apos;m going to talk about a program I started there ,
which , from my point of view , is the proudest thing I did .
that a lot of people don &apos;t get their portraits painted anymore ,
and we want to deliver them to future generations .
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series .
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
of amazing people who would come and I would interview .
And so what I &apos;m going to do is , not so much give you
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation ,
and when people deliver and when they don &apos;t and why .
That &apos;s just because , in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery ,
That was easy , but then I made the decision ,
that they needed to be people of a certain age ,
which at that point , when I created this program ,
For obvious reasons , it doesn &apos;t seem that old anymore to me .
And I thought really what we need is an elders program
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .
But the second part of it -- and the older I get ,
It &apos;s amazing what people will say when they know
but the one thing they or we have is that
So , we can then go back in our lives ,
and begin to reflect on how we got there .
what is it going to take to make this work ?
There are many kinds of interviews . We know them .
where it &apos;s more important who &apos;s asking the question than who answers .
That &apos;s Barbara Walters and others like that , and we like that .
I wanted to be , as I later thought of it , empathic ,
which is to say , to feel what they wanted to say
By the way , this was always done in public .
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual ,
and having me be the brush in their self-portrait .
Now , it turns out that I was pretty good at that .
is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright ,
and that was six months after he &apos;d had a stroke .
And he had never appeared in public since that point .
but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
and we had an hour conversation about his life ,
and after that a woman rushed up to me ,
and she said , &quot; Where did you train as a doctor ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I have no training as a doctor . I never claimed that . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , something very weird was happening .
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence ,
but I was so part of the process of getting that out .
But then I began to think of other things .
you know , ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals ,
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young .
and Abbott was filled with the life force --
I guess that &apos;s the way I think about it -- filled with it .
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
And , in fact , he did wind up opening up --
by the way , his energy is evidenced in other ways .
so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
and she said , &quot; Did you get George Abbott to talk ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; I &apos;m his old girlfriend , Maureen Stapleton ,
And then she made me go up with the tape of it
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who &apos;s modest ,
to listen to them , and they sit there and they say ,
people taking good hours of the day to be with them .
The worst interview I ever did : William L. Shirer .
The journalist who did &quot; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . &quot;
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months ,
and every time I &apos;d ask him about it , he &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , I just happened to be there .
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person .
and that they want to share it with you .
to how do you get through all the barriers we have .
and if all you &apos;re going to get from the interviewee is their public self ,
We know the great lines , we know the great moments ,
and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody .
This wasn &apos;t -- and some of you will remember
tough , aggressive and so forth . They have their place .
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say ,
to break out of their own cocoon of the public self ,
the more entrenched that person , that outer person was .
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have ,
as to whether her name means much to you .
one of the great phenomenal women of her day .
And , in fact , when we did the interview --
And I thought , this is going to be a piece of cake ,
because I always have preliminary talks with these people
We never talk before that because if you talk before ,
She was 80 , almost that day of the interview ,
Anything that I would ask , she would turn around , dismiss ,
and I was basically up there -- any of you
And I was dying . She was absolutely not giving me a thing .
And I began to wonder what was going on ,
That &apos;s the problem here , and she &apos;s fighting me for that ,
and so then I asked her a question --
I didn &apos;t know how I was going to get out of it --
I asked her a question about her days as a playwright ,
instead of saying , &quot; Oh yes , I was a playwright , and this is what blah blah blah , &quot;
she said , &quot; Oh , playwright . Everybody knows I was a playwright .
Most people think that I was an actress . I was never an actress . &quot;
But I hadn &apos;t asked that , and then she went off on a tear ,
and she said , &quot; Oh , well , there was that one time that I was an actress .
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman ,
and I got up there , &quot; and she went on and on , &quot; And then I got on the stage . &quot;
They upstaged me . &quot; And she said , &quot; Do you know what that is ? &quot;
And she looked at me , and it was like the successful arm-wrestle ,
and then , after that , she delivered an extraordinary account
I have to end that one . This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce .
I &apos;m not politically attracted to her , but through her life force ,
And the way she died -- she had , toward the end , a brain tumor .
That &apos;s probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine ,
and very few of us were invited to a dinner party .
and she walked around and talked to every person there
and then went back into the room and was never seen again .
She wanted the control of her final moment , and she did it amazingly .
Now , there are other ways that you get somebody to open up ,
but it was a little surprising for the person involved .
I interviewed Steve Martin . It wasn &apos;t all that long ago .
I turned to him and I said , &quot; Steve , &quot; or &quot; Mr. Martin ,
it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods .
And he looked at me , you know , as if to say ,
&quot; This is how you &apos;re going to start this thing , right off ? &quot;
And I said -- these are all arm wrestles , but they &apos;re affectionate --
and I said , &quot; My father was loving and supportive ,
And he looked at me , and then we heard the big sad story .
and , in fact , he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood ,
What is the key that &apos;s going to allow this to proceed ?
that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked .
And I &apos;ll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints .
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers .
Again , some of you will know him , most of you won &apos;t , Dumas Malone .
and by the way , at one point I asked him ,
but actually , I know him better than anyone who ever met him ,
because I got to read all of his letters . &quot;
So , he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years .
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson
and he said , &quot; Well ... &quot; -- I &apos;m going to do a bad southern accent .
But he said , &quot; Well , &quot; he said , &quot; I &apos;m afraid so . &quot;
and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit . &quot;
And he basically was saying that this was a man
He said , &quot; But I understand that . &quot; He said , &quot; I understand that . &quot;
He said , &quot; We southerners do like a smooth surface ,
so that there were times when he just didn &apos;t want the confrontation . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Now , John Adams was too honest . &quot;
And he started to talk about that , and later on he invited me to his house ,
and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts ,
But really the most important question I ever asked ,
and most of the times when I talk about it ,
people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity , or cruelty ,
but I promise you it was the right question .
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history .
At the time that I proposed to her that --
by the way , I would have proposed to her ; she was extraordinary --
&quot; Come to my apartment and we &apos;ll talk for those 15 minutes ,
And so I showed up in this dark , rambling New York apartment ,
and she called out to me , and she was in bed .
I had known that she had had a stroke ,
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed ,
but -- I speak of the life force --
She wasn &apos;t about to make up for this occasion .
and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment
was her will , which she had by her side .
She said , &quot; I keep this will by my bed , memento mori ,
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .
I thought , this is somebody I &apos;ve got to get in this series .
She came on . Of course she was wheelchaired on .
Half of her body was stricken , the other half not .
She was , of course , done up for the occasion ,
but this was a woman in great physical distress .
I said , &quot; Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful ? &quot;
and they felt that this was a kind of assault ,
And she began to talk about her childhood , when she was beautiful ,
and she literally turned -- here she was , in this broken body --
with her red hair and her light steps and so forth ,
And she began to talk about things that had happened
and how she could no longer count on her beauty ,
and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company ,
and in that process , she made a number of decisions .
it hadn &apos;t been offered to her , was her life .
although she did dance for a while , a choreographer
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real , real fact in her life .
It was an amazing privilege to do this series .
There were other moments like that , very few moments of silence .
is really waiting for people to ask them questions ,
so that they can be truthful about who they are
and I commend that to you , even if you &apos;re not doing interviews .
I have a story , a story that I would like to share with you .
It is a story of hope , resilience and glamour .
Today we have Nollywood , the third-largest film industry in the world .
In 2006 alone , almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria .
Now , try to imagine 40 , 50 films wrapped , distributed , every week
in the streets of Lagos , Nigeria and West Africa .
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars .
It has created thousands , if not tens of thousands of jobs .
But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement .
without government aid , and actually , it happened against all odds ,
in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy .
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words ,
My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia .
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa .
Even though I left when I was only three years old ,
I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life .
And it really was a place where I learned to walk .
and one of the things that I remember the most
is my family having this hard time to share stories .
Africa was either this exotic place , this imaginary land
And so we were always caught in this stereotype .
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa
as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives ,
So when I read in a newspaper in the business page
I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story
Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do ,
and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me .
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence
at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University .
And we really look how digital technology is changing ,
can make movies at a fraction of the cost .
I really had all the support to make this film .
I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure .
and told me , &quot; You know , Franco , in 25 years of covering Africa ,
I don &apos;t know if I have come across a story
that is so full of hope and so fun . &quot;
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa ,
a wonderful , talented film director who is with us tonight .
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood ,
following Bond in his quest to make an action movie
But I don &apos;t want to create too many expectations .
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience .
but they are re-edited and made for you , OK ?
Milverton Nwokedi : You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here .
They can afford to watch their &quot; Robocop &quot; and whatever .
Mahmood Ali Balogun : I think filmmaking in Nigeria , for those who work in it ,
is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living .
oh , you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood ,
it sells , you jump onto the location again to make another film ,
because if you don &apos;t make the next film , you &apos;re not going to feed .
Bond Emeruwa : So while we &apos;re entertaining , we should be able to educate .
I mean , 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood .
I think it &apos;s the most viable vehicle right now
So if you &apos;re making a movie , no matter what your topic is ,
it &apos;s not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming .
I mean , there are those films that people are making for quality ,
but the first thing you have to remember about this society
is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day ,
and these are the people that really watch these films .
that has just been born in this part of the world .
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa .
they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .
They are stories about our people , for our people .
Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi : We have been so deep into the foreign movies .
We can do something , something that when the world sees it ,
Come on . Don &apos;t run away . Come back . Come back .
SMW : You can now walk the street and see a role model .
You see how he talks . You see how he lives .
It &apos;s not just what you see in the picture .
It is not what you hear , you know , from the Western press .
Saint Obi : I was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
But then when I discovered the situation in my country ,
For a young man to really make it out here ,
you got to think of some negative things and all that ,
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor ,
without doing crime , without cheating nobody , without telling no lies .
Roboger Animadu : In big countries , when they do the movies ,
But here , we improvise these items , like the gunshots .
Like they go , here , now , now , you see the gun there ,
but you won &apos;t see any guns shot , we use knock-out .
Kevin Books Ikeduba : What I &apos;m scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face .
KBI : I &apos;m just telling her to make sure she places it well
so that it won &apos;t affect my face -- the explosion , you know .
But she &apos;s a professional . She knows what she &apos;s doing .
You know , this is Nollywood , where the magic lives .
RA : So now you &apos;re about to see how we do our own movies here ,
Franco Sacchi : So many things to say , so little time .
I just can &apos;t tell you -- there &apos;s one thing I want to tell you .
I spent , you know , several weeks with all these actors , producers ,
and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable
for , you know , a Westerner , a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe .
But always with a smile , always with an enthusiasm ,
&quot; I need to make movies like you need oxygen . &quot;
The Nigerian filmmakers really , really , are doing what they like .
And so it &apos;s a very , very important thing for them ,
A woman told me , &quot; When I see a Nollywood film ,
I can relax , I really -- I can breathe better . &quot;
and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed , you know ,
the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be .
We didn &apos;t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers .
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways .
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology ,
look at the Nigerian model , make their films , create jobs ,
create a narrative for the population , something to identify ,
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us .
Filmmakers , friends of mine , they look at Nollywood and they say ,
&quot; Wow , they are doing what we really want to do ,
and make a buck and live with this job . &quot;
And there &apos;s one thing , one small challenge that I have for you ,
and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling .
And I think this is really the theme of this session .
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter , but no stories .
I think that the key to a healthy society
and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this .
It &apos;s not an added sequence , just some voices from Nollywood .
Toyin Alousa : Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them .
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people &apos;s face ,
SO : I believe very soon , we閳ユ獧e not only going to have better movies ,
But we &apos;re telling it our own way , our own Nigerian way , African way .
We have diverse cultures , diverse cultures , there are so many ,
I don &apos;t see us exhausting the stories we have .
FS : My job ends here , and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work .
And I really hope that there will be many , many collaborations ,
Franco , you described this as the world &apos;s third largest film industry .
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
FS : Oh , yes . I think I mentioned briefly -- it &apos;s close to 2,000 films .
So it &apos;s safe to say that there are 2,000 films .
the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level ,
CA : And these aren &apos;t films that are primarily seen in cinemas ?
FS : Oh yes , of course . This is very important .
Maybe , you know , for you to try to imagine this ,
these are films that are distributed directly in markets .
FS : Oh , the format -- thank you for the question . Yes , it &apos;s VCDs .
It &apos;s a CD , it &apos;s a little bit more compressed image .
They actually didn &apos;t wait for , you know , the latest technology .
CA : So on the streets , are film casts ... ?
FS : You can be in a Lagos traffic jam
and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water . Yes .
And I have to say , this really proves that storytelling ,
And all I &apos;m going to try and prove to you with these slides
and relate to what &apos;s going on and problem solving for clients .
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems ,
I don &apos;t want you to see what I &apos;m doing up here .
In fact , it appeared in a porno comic book ,
I just show it because I want you to know
and I tried to build a building that fit into that context .
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context
and my premise is that they make a lot more sense
I then try to make a place that &apos;s comfortable and private and fairly serene ,
as I hope you &apos;ll find that slide on the right .
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
The building on the right at the top is now under construction .
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down ,
And it all related to the clients and the students
from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place .
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space
in downtown , in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into .
And it was my theory , or my point of view ,
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood ,
In the &apos; 60s I started working with paper furniture
and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale &apos;s .
We even made flooring , walls and everything , out of cardboard .
And the success of it threw me for a loop .
I couldn &apos;t deal with the success of furniture --
and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like .
And it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture ,
that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice .
and that ultimately led to the piece on the right --
happened when the kid that was working on this
took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up
And I put a piece of tape around it ,
as you see there , and realized you could sit on it ,
and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on .
I mean , the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo --
and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man ,
and if you &apos;re going to go back , we might as well go back to the beginning .
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger --
And then , I sliced off the head and the tail and everything
about the form of the fish and the movement .
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it --
it was an intuitive kind of thing , and I just kept going with it ,
and made this proposal for a building , which was only a proposal .
I was taken out to dinner after the contract
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff .
And after I got -- I was really drunk --
I was asked to do some sketches on napkins .
little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do .
And so I made a drawing with a fish , and I left Japan .
Three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings
Now , it &apos;s hard to do . It &apos;s hard to translate a fish form ,
And Oldenburg , who I work with a little once in a while ,
told me I couldn &apos;t do it , and so that made it even more exciting .
But he was right -- I couldn &apos;t do the tail .
I started to get the head OK , but the tail I couldn &apos;t do .
The thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat .
And I put them together , and you walk between them .
they didn &apos;t show the context , so you would think ,
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here
As for craft and technology and all those things
that you &apos;ve all been talking about , I was thrown for a complete loop .
we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models ,
and we used to make foam models , which that thing scanned .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
And when I got there , everything was perfect --
So , I decided to cut off the head and the tail .
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker .
And it &apos;s one of the nicest pieces I &apos;ve ever made , I think .
asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.
For reasons we don &apos;t want to talk about , it got delayed .
Toxic waste , I guess , is the key clue to that one .
And so we built a temporary building -- I &apos;m getting good at temporary --
and we put a conference room in that &apos;s a fish .
And , finally , Jay dragged me to my hometown , Toronto , Canada .
And there is a story -- it &apos;s a real story -- about my grandmother
putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid .
When I went to sleep , the next day it wasn &apos;t there .
And so I set up this interior for Jay &apos;s offices
And he didn &apos;t buy a sculpture , so I made one .
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother &apos;s ,
A few years ago , we did a performance piece in Venice , Italy ,
Claes &apos; , but those two little boys are my sons ,
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter ,
Dressed up like the AT &amp; amp ; T building by Claes --
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
And I can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an Oldenburg .
The only thing I did was , I made it possible for them
to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal ,
I &apos;ve been known to mess with things like chain link fencing .
I do it because it &apos;s a curious thing in the culture ,
And I &apos;m fascinated with that , which , like the paper furniture --
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link ,
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School .
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
And you can see , we started making a building together .
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life .
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together .
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building
on this funny lot in Venice , and I started with this three-piece thing ,
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle .
And one day I had a -- oh , well , the other way .
I had the binoculars from Claes , and I put them there ,
and I could never get rid of them after that .
when he sent me the first model of the real proposal .
that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars , you know ,
I use a lot of metal in my work ,
and I have a hard time connecting with the craft .
I said , &quot; If I can &apos;t get the craft that I want ,
who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials .
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building
and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit
for the metalworkers &apos; unions of America and Canada in Washington ,
and I did it on the condition that they become my partners
in the future and help me with all future metal buildings , etc. etc .
to have these people , these craftsmen , interested in it .
It &apos;s a way of connecting , at least , with some of those people
that are so important to the realization of architecture .
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller , in Sacramento .
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place --
I mean , it &apos;s kind of a trite thing to say ,
but it is real that they wanted to have a central place
where the cafeteria would be , where the people would come
So it &apos;s out in the middle of nowhere , and you approach it .
in a very light gauge , so it would buckle .
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier &apos;s aesthetic .
and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy .
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman .
And when I was awarded the contract I , at the very beginning ,
asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me .
Because these were ideas that we were talking about ,
it &apos;s all about &#91; a &#93; metaphor for a city , maybe .
And we did it over the phone and by fax .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
He &apos;d made a building with a dome and he had a little tower .
And so I decided to put him in a depression .
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in .
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax ,
going back and forth over a couple of weeks &apos; period .
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
And so then I put this big billboard behind it .
In Boston , we had that old building on the left .
It was a very prominent building off the freeway ,
and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up
and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood ,
Mine got a little exuberant , but I used lead copper ,
which is a beautiful material , and it turns green in 100 years .
and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved ,
because they have very strict kind of design guideline ,
and they wouldn &apos;t normally think I would fit them .
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper
In Barcelona , on Las Ramblas for some film festival ,
made a building out of it , and they built it .
I flew in one night and took this picture .
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me .
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica --
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa ,
in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back .
It &apos;s the support labs , which , by some coincidence , required no windows .
In the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon --
and so it was an opportunity that I seized ,
because I didn &apos;t have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form .
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .
They &apos;ve been building it so long I don &apos;t remember where it is .
and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake .
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house .
That big metal thing is a passage , and in it is --
you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom ,
I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota .
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it .
We ended up having to make it a sculpture , because the dilemma was ,
how do you build a building that doesn &apos;t look like the language ?
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural
from the main house and all the windows are on the other side .
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
It &apos;s made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply --
We used it at Loyola on the chapel , and it didn &apos;t work .
In this case we learned how to detail it .
Going out to the lake , you can see all those new buildings we built .
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site .
This is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built ,
and we followed the axis , and they &apos;re two kind of goalposts .
which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company .
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top , folded .
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum ,
and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
So , the centerline of this thing -- we &apos;d preserve it ,
and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings
by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox , etc . , that are underway .
And a long time ago , about &apos; 82 or something , after my house --
that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard --
and the owner of this lot worked for me
I guess wealthier or something -- something happened --
and asked me to design a house for her on this site .
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end --
here you see on the photographs of the site --
slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms
like a retaining wall , creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom ,
which I designed like a kind of a barge ,
When you sleep in this bedroom , I hope --
I &apos;ve offered to marry her so I could sleep there ,
but she said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
you feel like you &apos;re on a kind of barge on some kind of lake .
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
And then up above there &apos;s a garden on this side of the living room ,
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Anyway , you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees .
A guest bedroom , which has this dome with marble on it .
And then you enter into the living room and then so on .
You come down from this level along the stairway ,
and you enter the bedroom here , going into the lake .
and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .
The material is lead copper , like in the building in Boston .
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land --
it &apos;s 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas
and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free .
But the idea is , the windows are all placed
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up --
And you feel like you &apos;re in your own kind of village .
And this is in Anaheim , California , and it &apos;s a freeway building .
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour ,
And you &apos;re through this room in a split second ,
On the backside , it &apos;s much more humane -- entrance ,
And then this thing here -- I &apos;m hoping as you drive by you &apos;ll hear
the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it .
which is an office building for a furniture company .
These are the early studies , but they have to sell furniture
to normal people , so if I did the building and it was too fancy ,
then people might say , &quot; Well , the furniture looks OK in his thing ,
but no , it ain &apos;t going to look good in my normal building . &quot;
So we &apos;ve made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here ,
and we &apos;ve taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them
so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate .
And you &apos;re looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here .
And back in here , in this already treed park ,
we &apos;re doing a very dense building called the American Center ,
which has a theater , apartments , dance school , an art museum ,
restaurants and all kinds of -- it &apos;s a very dense program --
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up
by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off .
I showed you the other model , the one --
this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing --
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it ?
And these are the kind of study models we did .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built .
But out of it came finally this resolution , where the elevator piece
And then this kind of twist , with this balcony and the skirt ,
kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
So it would all be built in stone , in French limestone ,
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this .
On the side facing the street it &apos;s much more normal ,
except I slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point ,
these housing units made a gesture to the corner .
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .
If any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me
to do a house for him in the Hamptons .
And I keep thinking , &quot; This is going to be the last fish . &quot;
I say , &quot; I &apos;m not going to do it anymore -- I don &apos;t want to do it anymore --
I just added it so that we &apos;d have enough money in the budget
This is Euro Disney , and I &apos;ve worked with all of the guys
I think I &apos;m from Mars for them , and they are for me ,
and the hotel that Tony Baxter &apos;s group is doing out here .
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall ,
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull ,
I made a light grid that &apos;s perpendicular to the train station ,
and then crashed all these simpler forms into it .
The light grid will have a light , be lit up at night and give a
In Switzerland -- Germany , actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel ,
we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum .
And I tried to -- there &apos;s a Nick Grimshaw building over here ,
And I don &apos;t gave good slides to show -- it &apos;s just been completed --
but this piece here is this building , and these pieces here and here .
And as you pass by it &apos;s always part -- you see it as all of these pieces
If it &apos;s going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn &apos;t show anything ,
I &apos;m so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful .
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit .
And from the building in the back , you see it as
See , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built
And it &apos;s not a great building , but I approached it optimistically ,
that we would make a compositional relationship between us
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
This is the foyer , which is kind of a garden structure .
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler ,
to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA , etc .
which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space ,
and so that &apos;s one of the problems of a competition .
You have to then try and get that back in some way .
These were the three buildings that were the ideal --
and it has more seats than any of these
and when we met our new acoustician , he told us
this was the right shape or this was the right shape .
And we tried many shapes , trying to get the energy
of the original design within an acoustical , acceptable format .
with the sloping outside walls , which the acoustician said
were crucial to this and later decided they weren &apos;t ,
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural
and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room .
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a
kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit ,
Now , this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being --
and so I wouldn &apos;t take it literally , except the feeling of the space .
and they bounce them off this and see where it all works .
But you get the sense of the hall in section .
And so it will be quite a different shape .
fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well .
When you get into a box , it &apos;s harder to do it -- and here we are ,
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi .
But this is how I do work . I do take pieces and bits and look at it
And of course it &apos;s not going to look like that ,
but it is the crazy way I tend to work .
And then finally , in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture
at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower , the highest building in L.A.
And I was asked to do a fish , and so I did a snake .
It &apos;s a public space , and I made it kind of a garden structure ,
It &apos;s a kiva , and Larry &apos;s putting some water in there ,
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish , and we &apos;re working on that ,
at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel ,
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it ,
perverted it , into the form of the fish , and created a kind of
a 19th-century contraption that looks like , that will sit --
this is the beach and the harbor out in front ,
and this is really a shopping center with department stores .
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of
We showed this to the hotel people the other day ,
and they were terrified and said that nobody would come
And finally , I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger .
but this is a building I did for him in 1964 , I think .
A little studio -- and it &apos;s sadly for sale .
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing .
He designed the robot as the cashier , and the head moves ,
And the food wasn &apos;t as good as the stuff , and so it failed .
It should have been the other way around --
? I can &apos;t get used to this lifestyle ?
I &apos;d like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects .
I think it &apos;s one of the most exciting that I &apos;m working on ,
It &apos;s a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet ,
the number one cause of death in children under five ,
No , it &apos;s breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires --
acute respiratory infections caused by this . Can you believe that ?
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
So this is a picture of rural Haiti . Haiti is now 98 percent deforested .
You &apos;ll see scenes like this all over the island .
that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil .
So the rains come , they go down the rivers , and the flooding happens .
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this :
and they make charcoal in order to do it .
It &apos;s not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage .
They know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
and solar energy doesn &apos;t cook the way that they like their food prepared .
You &apos;ll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree ,
cut it down and make charcoal out of it .
that &apos;s been done to look at alternative cooking fuels .
About four years ago I took a team of students down to Haiti ,
and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked .
And the idea was that you could take waste paper ;
you could compress it ; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel .
So our engineering students went to work on it ,
they were able to triple the throughput of this device .
So you could imagine they were very excited about it .
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them .
And one of the things that they found was they didn &apos;t burn .
So it was a little discouraging to the students .
And in fact if you look closely , right here ,
As it turns out , there actually wasn &apos;t any waste paper in this village .
And while it was a good use of government paperwork
for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village ,
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel
that used something that was readily available on the local level .
You see these all over Haiti as well . They &apos;re small-scale sugar mills .
after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called &quot; bagasse . &quot;
It has no other use . It has no nutritional value ,
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it .
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way
to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel
that would be something that people could easily cook with ,
So over the next couple of years , students and I worked to develop a process .
So you start with the bagasse , and then you take a very simple kiln
that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum .
After some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it
to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln ,
and then you end up with this carbonized material here .
and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .
And conveniently , one of my students was from Ghana ,
and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called &quot; kokonte , &quot;
which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root .
And so what we did was we looked , and we found
that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti , under the name of &quot; manioc . &quot;
And in fact , it &apos;s grown all over the world --
yucca , tapioca , manioc , cassava , it &apos;s all the same thing --
And you can make a very thick , sticky porridge out of it ,
which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes .
So we did this . We went down to Haiti .
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Chabon ,
-- that &apos;s right . So I &apos;m actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT .
Now I &apos;m going to take you to a different continent . This is India ,
and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India ; it &apos;s cow dung .
And more than in Haiti , this produces really smoky fires ,
and this is where you see the health impacts
of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel .
because they &apos;re the ones who are around the cooking fires .
So we wanted to see if we could introduce
and they didn &apos;t have cassava , but that didn &apos;t stop us .
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass .
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area .
And we did side-by-side tests , and here you can see
And you can see that it &apos;s a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel .
And in fact , it heats the water a lot more quickly .
was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal ,
it didn &apos;t burn as long . And the briquettes crumbled a little bit ,
and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking .
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette
so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti .
So we went back to MIT , we took out the Instron machine ,
and we figured out what sort of forces did you need
in order to compress a briquette to the level
that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ?
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this ,
we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process ,
to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there .
we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal ,
which actually now burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal .
So now we &apos;re in a situation where we have a product , which is actually better
than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace ,
In Haiti alone , about 30 million trees are cut down every year .
In addition , the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars .
That &apos;s an awful lot for a country of Haiti --
and an average income of less than 400 dollars .
So this is where we &apos;re also moving ahead with our charcoal project .
And one of the things that I think is also interesting ,
is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who &apos;s been doing risk analysis .
And he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health impacts
you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal
but up until now , there weren &apos;t ways to do it without cutting down trees .
that &apos;s using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel .
is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month .
and it &apos;s even lower tech than what you just saw ,
if you can imagine such a thing . Here it is .
So what is this ? This is corncobs turned into charcoal .
And the beauty of this is that you don &apos;t need to form briquettes --
it comes ready made . This is my $ 100 laptop , right here .
And I think one of the things , which is also remarkable about this technology ,
where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes
and you have the extra step of cooking the binder ,
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now ,
which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life .
But once you see it , like you guys in the front row , all right ,
-- here it is . And this is I think a perfect example
of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things .
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal ,
and they can produce excess and sell it in the market
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting ,
and I &apos;m really looking forward to see where it takes us .
So when we talk about , now , the future we will create ,
one of the things that I think is necessary
is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .
And now I don &apos;t actually mean the world that we live in .
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday
means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand ,
and where , when you work 10 hours a day ,
you &apos;re still only earning 60 dollars in a month .
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water .
That &apos;s as if the entire workforce of the State of California
worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water .
It &apos;s a place where , for example , if this were India ,
in this room , only three of us would have a car .
only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet .
If this were Zambia , 300 of you would be farmers ,
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for .
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers ,
our designers , our business people , our entrepreneurs to be facing .
These are the solutions that we need to find .
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address .
One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise ,
so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out --
using the same traditional basket making , poultry rearing , etc .
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
We need to work with the people in these communities ,
and give them the resources and the tools that they need
to solve their own problems . That &apos;s the best way to do it .
So we need to create this future , and we need to start doing it now .
Chris Anderson : Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question --
just tell us about one of the other things that you &apos;ve worked on .
Amy Smith : A couple of other things that we &apos;re working on
are looking at ways to do low-cost water quality testing ,
so that communities can maintain their own water systems ,
know when they &apos;re working , know when they treat them , etc .
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection
and improving the ability to be able to do that .
CA : What &apos;s the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ?
Do you need to find entrepreneurs , or venture capitalists ,
or what do you need to take what you &apos;ve got and get it to scale ?
AS : Yeah , I think its large numbers of people moving it forward .
It &apos;s a difficult thing ; it &apos;s a marketplace which is very fragmented
So you can &apos;t use the same models that you use in the United States
And we &apos;re a pretty small staff , which is me .
So , you know , I do what I can with the students .
We have 30 students a year go out into the field
and try to implement this and move it forward .
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame ,
as -- you know , you can &apos;t expect to get something done in a year or two years ;
you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead .
But I think with the vision to do that , we can move forward .
My thing with school lunch is , it &apos;s a social justice issue .
for the Berkeley Unified School District . I have 90 employees
trying to change how we feed kids in America .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk to you a little bit about today .
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there .
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened .
When I took over this , I tried to really figure out ,
How do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
And I &apos;ll tell you why we need to change it ,
between a healthy planet , healthy food and healthy kids .
And that if we don &apos;t do that , the antithesis ,
And the reason this is happening , by and large ,
the way the USDA puts food on kids &apos; plates
And by -- tacitly , all of us send our kids ,
that &apos;s what they &apos;re learning . So that &apos;s really what this is all about .
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness .
We now live in a country where most of us don &apos;t decide ,
by and large , what we eat . We see big businesses , Monsanto and DuPont ,
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .
much of what people eat . And that &apos;s really , really a problem .
and how I was going to change what kids ate ,
I really started focusing on what we would teach them .
was about regional food -- trying to eat food
And clearly , with what &apos;s going on with fossil fuel usage ,
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away ,
you know , we really have to start thinking about whether or not
and we really start to feed kids regional food .
Now , most school districts can &apos;t really afford organic food ,
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
We have things like E. coli that we can &apos;t fix ,
that we can &apos;t make kids better when they get sick .
U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year .
That means every one of us , and our children ,
those bags you have at home . If I had one here
and that pile I would have on the floor
is what we consume and feed our children every year
these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply ,
Okay , we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT ,
but we know it wasn &apos;t good for you and me .
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply .
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
That &apos;s what I really try and get people to understand .
I really try and teach it to kids . I think it &apos;s the most important .
in which kids will grow up to be healthy ,
but we have to figure out what sustainability is .
In less than 200 years , you know , just in a few generations ,
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --
on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison ,
We &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
if we continue not to teach them what good food is ,
what &apos;s going to happen ? You know , what is going to happen ?
What &apos;s going to happen to our whole medical system ?
that have a life less long than our own .
has said , of the children born in the year 2000 --
And if that &apos;s not enough , they &apos;ve gone on to say ,
in our country &apos;s history to die at a younger age than their parents .
and if they do , you should be in therapy .
But oops , maybe they &apos;re responsible for what kids eat .
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see .
for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods
The result of which is kids think they &apos;re going to die
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more .
This is the USDA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
And the one over there , that &apos;s bigger than my head ,
It &apos;s because of the way the government commodifies food ,
Which is why I say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
Now , I said I &apos;m doing this in Berkeley , and you might think ,
&quot; Oh , Berkeley . Of course you can do it in Berkeley . &quot;
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago .
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids : Extremo Burritos ,
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen
was a can crusher , because if it didn &apos;t come in a can ,
Chicken nuggets , Tater Tots , chocolate milk with high fructose ,
That &apos;s what the government says is okay to feed our kids .
It ain &apos;t okay . You know what ? It is not okay .
Now I don &apos;t know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets ,
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like
Well , Tyson did , because there &apos;s no chicken in the chicken .
In fact , this may be what a lot of parents serve ,
as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .
There &apos;s not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .
There &apos;s a lot of stuff we can do . There &apos;s a lot of schools
Those are my hands . I get up at 4 a.m.
every day and go cook the food for the kids ,
and expect these are going to be healthy citizens .
or the generation after , to be able to think like this
You know what ? They &apos;re just going to be sick .
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley
is I realized that , you know , this was all pretty amazing to people ,
very , very different , and I needed to market it .
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent .
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .
Now I &apos;m in charge of all the cooking classes
and all the gardening classes in our school district .
This is what we &apos;re serving this week at the schools .
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes .
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
They also may be growing them . And we serve them in the cafeterias .
If we &apos;re going to change children &apos;s relationship to food ,
hands-on experience -- you &apos;re looking in cooking and gardening classes --
Now you &apos;ve probably garnered that I don &apos;t love the USDA ,
and I don &apos;t have any idea what to do with their pyramid ,
this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top , I don &apos;t know .
You know , run up into the end of the rainbow ,
I don &apos;t know what you do with it . So , I came up with my own .
This is available on my website in English and Spanish ,
and it &apos;s a visual way to talk to kids about food .
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools .
maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals
is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car
and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer .
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ?
I work with kids a lot . These are kids I work with in Harlem .
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating .
We have to teach kids that if they &apos;re on a diet
they go up and down , just like if they &apos;re on a diet of crack .
And we have to pull it all together . We have composting in all of our schools .
You know , the things that we maybe do at home
It has to be so much a part of them
are sort of at the end of our careers ,
and we need to be giving these kids --
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships .
who are willing to do R &amp; amp ; D with me ,
who are really willing to work to go into schools .
That comes down to under five dollars an hour .
Most of you spend 10 , 15 dollars an hour
So we &apos;re spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system .
In our school district , the way we afford this
towards nutrition services . And I think if every school district
Of course , it &apos;s not all about food ; it &apos;s also about
And one of the simple things we can do
You know , if you have kids coming into lunch
and all they &apos;re going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess ,
you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside .
And then , at one in the afternoon , they &apos;re totally crashing .
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down
when you pick them up , because they haven &apos;t had lunch .
So if the only thing they &apos;d have to do after lunch is go to class ,
believe me , they &apos;re going to sit there and eat their lunch .
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .
And , you know , I &apos;m not that better off now .
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking
about ways to teach people how to cook again ,
There was just a big study done , and so many schools
are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning .
You know , it &apos;s crazy . It &apos;s crazy what we &apos;re doing .
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA ,
and this -- I &apos;m sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece ,
because I think this is something we all have to understand .
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars
People say , &quot; Oh my God , where are we going to get 8 billion ? &quot;
In this country , we &apos;re spending 110 billion dollars a year
which is why we need all the diet aids .
with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes .
about needing 8 billion more , it &apos;s not a lot .
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead .
That means we spend less than a dollar a day
most schools , 80 to 90 cents . In L.A. , it &apos;s 56 cents .
So we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , OK , on lunch .
but I go to Starbucks and Pete &apos;s and places like that ,
and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars .
we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids
to pay for school lunch that gets this food .
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of .
whether we care about children , whether we have nieces or nephews ,
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids ,
to a farmers &apos; market . Just do tastings with them .
what about asking for the health of our children ?
that protect the most important organ in our body : the brain .
It &apos;s where our senses are located , our special senses --
is peppered , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --
we wouldn &apos;t be able to look at the world around us .
And then we have the sensual factor of the face .
It &apos;s the face where we &apos;re attracted to with that .
You &apos;re looking at the image on your left-hand side --
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose ,
that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live .
He doesn &apos;t have dysmorphophobia , but I &apos;m using his photograph
to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic .
Here &apos;s a classic example : Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor
that &apos;s growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose ,
that the parents and close loved ones of these children
They &apos;ve grown used to their face ; they think they &apos;re special .
about whether these children should have the lesion removed .
has changed so dramatically and they don &apos;t recognize them .
They say , &quot; How dare you take this child out of the house
Shouldn &apos;t you be doing something about this ? Why haven &apos;t you had it removed ? &quot;
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion ,
and the children play more readily with other children .
as we &apos;re trying to project ourselves to the world .
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day ,
trying to look like Sean Connery , as I did ,
I &apos;ve chosen to show this profile view of Sue
because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward
I &apos;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
push your lower jaws forward . Turn to the person next to you
That &apos;s exactly what people used to say to Sue .
But people used to say to her , &quot; Why are you so miserable ? &quot;
Teachers and peers were underestimating her ; she was teased at school .
And that &apos;s the change that can be achieved for teenagers .
to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery .
so they couldn &apos;t recognize the before and after --
what we found was that the patients were regarded
Well that &apos;s not surprising , but we also asked them to judge them
they don &apos;t necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery .
is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune .
is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma .
two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed
from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone ,
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations ,
He worked as an advocate . He continued to play cricket .
and this was probably because he had a successful , fulfilling job
I don &apos;t say he overcame this ; he didn &apos;t overcome it .
This was something more than that . He ignored it .
He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life
whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer
that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on .
It took 23 hours . I did it with my neurosurgeon .
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face --
He got married . He had a son called Jeremiah .
shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am . &quot;
So we &apos;ve seen that we can change people &apos;s faces .
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --
And actually that &apos;s probably the difference between cosmetic surgery
Because you might say , &quot; Well , this type of surgery
If you do cosmetic surgery , patients are often less happy .
Sue wasn &apos;t trying to achieve difference in her life .
I &apos;ll move it off , and we &apos;ll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London
who &apos;s got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face ,
and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly .
her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress ,
and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world ,
judging them just on the photographs that were showed .
We &apos;d like to spend time with him . He looks friendly .
We think we can judge people on their expressions .
to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --
Todorov tells us that , in a tenth of a second ,
Are we uncomfortable with this image ? Yes , we are .
Would we be happy if our doctor &apos;s face , our lawyer &apos;s face ,
not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov , but a five-minute rule .
may seem boring and you lose interest in them ,
and the people who you didn &apos;t immediately seek out ,
a little bit of the surgery that we do --
who &apos;s had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .
This is what Ann wants . She wants to be out kayaking ,
And that &apos;s what she achieved , and that &apos;s what we have to get to .
a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off
And he lost his lower jaw , his lip , his chin
This is the bar that he set for us .
&quot; I want to look like this . This is how I looked before . &quot;
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it .
We then put bone and tissue from the back .
and you can see the implants being put in --
It &apos;s thicker , it &apos;s darker , it &apos;s coarser , it doesn &apos;t have the contours .
but we &apos;re still not good at replacing the facial skin .
But the patients are going to have to take drugs
that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives .
They have an increased risk of infection , an increased risk of malignancy .
like a heart , or liver , or lung transplant --
are the patients going to say , if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on ,
&quot; I wish I &apos;d had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this
because I &apos;m now dying of a malignant cancer &quot; ? We don &apos;t know yet .
Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin , who did the first operation ,
Donors are going to be short on the ground ,
because how many people want to have their loved one &apos;s face
I can put it in place where it &apos;s meant to be .
and lo and behold , leave it for four months and the face is grown .
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe .
We &apos;re still not curing enough patients -- it &apos;s the most disfiguring cancer .
so we don &apos;t just sit on our laurels and say , &quot; Okay , we &apos;re doing okay .
Then I have been walking East for 20 years --
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me
to the bottom , to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor .
I could find noor , the hidden light of Afghanistan .
to kill the pain and to stop the hunger
of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh ?
The region is not secure , but full of the Taliban ,
It &apos;s an amazing thing that we &apos;re here to talk
about patients who are taking control of their cases ,
patients who are saying , &quot; You know what , I know what the odds are ,
but I &apos;m going to go look for more information .
And what I then found out about what &apos;s called the e-Patient movement --
I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave ,
as if it was somebody who &apos;s not in the room here ,
Some of our talks today , we still act like that .
there are heads nodding , people who say , &quot; Yes , I know exactly what you mean . &quot;
So when you hear what I &apos;m going to talk about here today ,
of all the patients that I have ever met ,
This is about letting patients play a more active role
that the most underutilized resource in all of health care
and this was when we first landed on the Moon .
that &apos;s the place where you and I are right now ,
It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee .
but there &apos;s a very strong component -- I was in that movement --
And it talked about how to build your own house ,
how to grow your own food , all kinds of things .
was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog .
of what we do in medicine and health care
In fact , he said it was 70 to 80 percent
of how we actually take care of our bodies .
the key thing that holds us back is access to information .
And when the Web came along , that changed everything ,
he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then .
In 2006 , I went to my doctor for a regular physical ,
and I had said , &quot; I have a sore shoulder . &quot;
you may have noticed , those of you who have been through a medical crisis
named the date when they found out about their condition .
I was at the office ; my desk was clean ;
I had the blue partition carpet on the walls .
He said , &quot; Dave , I pulled up the X-ray image
I said , &quot; So you need me to get back in there ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , we &apos;re going to need to do a CT scan of your chest . &quot;
And in parting I said , &quot; Is there anything I should do ? &quot;
&quot; just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife . &quot;
and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs .
So at that point we knew that it was cancer .
I got to do what many women have --
But what we saw -- this is an MRI image .
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
One was growing out the front and it had already erupted ,
One was growing out the back , and it attached to the soleus muscle ,
which is a big muscle in the back that I &apos;d never heard of ,
but all of a sudden I cared about it .
Now I &apos;ve been Googling -- I &apos;ve been online since 1989 on CompuServe .
I went home , and I know you can &apos;t read the details here ;
My point is I went to a respected medical website ,
And cancer , a tumor , is something you grow out of your own tissue .
if I don &apos;t like the first results I get ,
I mean , I &apos;d been getting tired in the evening ,
but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do .
And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer
Totally by coincidence , there &apos;s that thing in my lung .
In the left femur , the left thigh bone , there &apos;s another one .
I fainted and landed on it , and it broke .
and then just for good measure , I had these other tumors --
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue .
And what I read was that my median survival
I thought , &quot; What &apos;s my mother &apos;s face going to look like
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want you guys to get married prematurely
just so you can do it while Dad &apos;s still alive . &quot;
Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help ,
a network of cancer patients , of all amazing things .
There is no cure , but there &apos;s something that sometimes works --
And don &apos;t let them give you anything else first .
in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers . &quot;
you can &apos;t find a website that gives patients that information .
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days
because I try to keep my talks technically accurate .
but when it &apos;s your own tissue that you &apos;ve grown ,
because I started a patient support community of my own
and one of my friends , one of my relatives actually ,
And the story of how all that happens is in this book .
Me being me , I put the numbers from my hospital &apos;s website
are where I got the two doses of interleukin
And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between .
Who knows what we &apos;ll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it .
The punch line is that a year and a half later ,
I was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter ,
and it was just her and me for that moment ,
I was so glad that she didn &apos;t have to say to her mother ,
Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients
who are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease .
And she thought , &quot; You know , if I have a nutrition facts label
She came to realize that there were a lot of people
that you just don &apos;t hear about at medical conferences .
I &apos;ve gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data .
And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago ,
because you people can &apos;t be trusted to keep it clean . &quot;
which is starting to break out , starting to break through --
And in fact , I want to do a little something improvisational for you here .
? I want to be an e-Patient just like Dave ?
? Gimme my damn data , cuz it &apos;s my life to save ?
than the health tools that are available to you
And I thought , &quot; You know , I wonder what my soleus muscle is ? &quot;
So you can click on things and remove it .
And I saw , &quot; Aha , that &apos;s the kidney and the soleus muscle . &quot;
But if we can get that data out from behind the dam
who knows what we &apos;ll be able to come up with .
because 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms .
And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going .
And some doctors think , &quot; Yeah right , you &apos;re really in pain . &quot;
Well that &apos;s not what he was supposed to do with it .
So she had it read again , she wanted to have it read again ,
He said , &quot; If you don &apos;t want to follow my instructions ,
So she pulled up the CD of the scan images ,
See , that is an empowered patient -- no medical training .
was because she had access to the raw data .
Tim Berners-Lee himself , inventor of the Web , gave a talk
And he got them chanting by the end of the talk ,
Back in New York , I am the head of development
as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company .
where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff ,
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early
so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers
who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --
who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people
He said , &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go upstairs , past the fire ,
and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters ,
who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point ,
into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
The act of kindness she noted above all others :
someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness
but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage
Serve food at a soup kitchen . Clean up a neighborhood park .
Not every day is going to offer us a chance
but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
is that a billion people have been stuck living
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years ,
And so , the real question to pose is not , &quot; Can we be optimistic ? &quot;
It &apos;s , &quot; How can we give credible hope to that billion people ? &quot;
That , to my mind , is the fundamental challenge now of development .
What I &apos;m going to offer you is a recipe ,
a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good ,
which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest .
Compassion , because a billion people are living in societies
So , what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion ?
&quot; What did we do last time the rich world got serious
That gives us , it turns out , quite a good clue ,
except you have to go back quite a long time .
about developing another region was in the late 1940s .
and the region that needed to be developed was my world , Europe .
It wasn &apos;t just compassion for Europe , though there was that .
because , in the late 1940s , country after country in Central Europe
was falling into the Soviet bloc , and so you knew you &apos;d no choice .
So , what did you do , last time you got serious ?
Well , yes , you had a big aid program . Thank you very much .
That was Marshall aid : we need to do it again . Aid is part of the solution .
Well , you tore up your trade policy , and totally reversed it .
After the war , you opened your markets to Europe ,
you dragged Europe into the then-global economy , which was your economy ,
through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
Before the war , your security policy had been isolationist .
After the war , you tear that up , you put 100,000 troops in Europe
Before the war , you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct
that you weren &apos;t even willing to join the League of Nations .
you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ,
you found the IMF , you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --
Of course , the details of policy are going to be different ,
for the bottom billion , so that they actually catch up .
We need to be at least as serious as we were then .
Now , today I &apos;m going to take just one of those four .
I &apos;m going to take the one that sounds the weakest ,
the one that &apos;s just motherhood and apple pie --
in how we could do something to strengthen governance ,
and I &apos;m going to show you that that is enormously important now .
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion ,
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money
into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
Partly , they &apos;re pumping money in because commodity prices are high ,
but it &apos;s not just that . There &apos;s also a range of new discoveries .
Uganda has just discovered oil , in about the most disastrous location on Earth ;
Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground .
Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue .
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion .
So , the flow of resources from the commodity booms
The question is , how is it going to help their development ?
So , here comes a bit of science , and this is a bit of science I &apos;ve done
I &apos;ve looked to see what is the relationship between
And I &apos;ve looked globally , I &apos;ve taken all the countries in the world
And the short run -- say , the first five to seven years -- is just great .
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved ,
but also that drives up output across the board .
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic ! That &apos;s the short run .
You go up in the short run , but then most societies
historically have ended up worse than if they &apos;d had no booms at all .
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go ;
it &apos;s a forecast of the consequences , the long-term consequences ,
So , what goes wrong ? Why is there this &quot; resource curse , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
And again , I &apos;ve looked at that , and it turns out
that the critical issue is the level of governance ,
You go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term .
That &apos;s Norway , the richest country in Europe . It &apos;s Australia . It &apos;s Canada .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing across the bottom billion at the moment .
And the question is whether the short run will persist .
And with bad governance historically , over the last 40 years , it hasn &apos;t .
It &apos;s countries like Nigeria , which are worse off than if they &apos;d never had oil .
So , there &apos;s a threshold level above which you go up in the long term ,
it &apos;s about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s .
So , the question is , are the bottom billion above or below that threshold ?
Now , there &apos;s one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s ,
So I thought , well , maybe that is the thing
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy .
So , I looked . Democracy does have significant effects --
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies .
At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research , but --
-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that .
there &apos;s electoral competition , which determines how you acquire power ,
and there are checks and balances , which determine how you use power .
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing
whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good .
And so , what the countries of the bottom billion need
How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances ?
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards ,
which will be voluntary , but which would spell out the key decision points
That is the very simple idea that governments should report
than reformers in Nigeria adopted it , pushed it and published the revenues in the paper .
People wanted to know what their government was getting
So , we know it works . What would the content be of these international standards ?
I can &apos;t go through all of them , but I &apos;ll give you an example .
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --
the economic processes , taking the resources out of the ground
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction .
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment ,
how they &apos;ve been sold over the last 40 years ?
A company flies in , does a deal with a minister .
and it &apos;s quite often great for the minister --
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth
is of course the treasury -- that is , the British Treasury .
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
Just in time , a set of economists got there and said ,
&quot; Why not try an auction ? It &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,
think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like .
When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone ,
the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team
If we could do it , we would change the world .
We would be helping the reformers in these societies ,
That &apos;s our modest role . We cannot change these societies ,
but we can help the people in these societies
If you think about it , the cost of promulgating international rules
is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies ,
what politicians do , especially in relation to Africa , is gestures :
And so I realized we had to go through the business
That &apos;s why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist ,
and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach .
However , I have to say , the process of communication
This is why I &apos;m on this stage , but it &apos;s alarming .
My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks ,
and the blog comment said , &quot; Collier is not charismatic --
and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry ,
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
I went off on my own to become an artist ,
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
to shift from being an object you look at
of a million and a half hand-tied knots --
out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
My life was not going to be the same .
its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture
who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
to trace the paths of subway trains above ground
like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness
and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami ,
I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
Then I got a call from New York City
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
And I worked in mines . And I realized that
And I wanted , through color and large format cameras
a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography ,
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes ,
is the speed at which we &apos;re taking all our resources .
And so then I went out to develop a whole series
And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc
that there is extraction , where we &apos;re taking it from the ground ,
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil ,
where all of our parts of cars , our tires ,
where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up ?
a way in which I could explore and research the world ,
well , how much carbon it would take , and how much organic material ?
I think of that liter , and how much carbon .
And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton ,
and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy .
to produce what we use , the 30 billion barrels we use per year .
And that also brought me to the fact that
Saudi Arabia and now Canada , with its dirty oil .
And together they only form about 15 years of supply .
So , it &apos;s not a question of if , but a question of when
and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really
to begin to deal with what I think is probably
one of the most challenging issues of our time ,
And I would like to say that , on the other side of it ,
30 , 40 years from now , the children that I have ,
I can look at them and say , &quot; We did everything
what I feel is one of the most important and critical
Hi . I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back ,
just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
Soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program ,
control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
People have wanted to look inside the human mind ,
Well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that .
You had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We don &apos;t have to inject anything . We don &apos;t need radiation .
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter &apos;s brain -- literally , fly into his body --
but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
When Peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there
is the interface to the functioning of Peter &apos;s mind taking place .
Now you &apos;ve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms ,
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .
What &apos;s new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he &apos;s inside the scanner .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
If he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain :
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have .
We all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
Chronic pain is an example . If you burn yourself , you pull your hand away .
But if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time ,
it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
If we can look at the activation in the brain that &apos;s producing the pain ,
we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information ,
and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain
and select brain areas to do that same thing .
What you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
This may shock you , but we &apos;re literally reading this person &apos;s brain in real time .
and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
They &apos;re learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates .
As they do it , in the upper left is a display
that &apos;s yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
but , in clinical trials , we &apos;re seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients .
This is not &quot; The Matrix . &quot; You can only do this to yourself . You take control .
I &apos;ve seen inside my brain . You will too , soon .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences .
These are some of the areas we &apos;re working on today that I don &apos;t have time to go into in detail .
But I want to leave with you the big question .
We are the first generation that &apos;s going to be able to enter into ,
questions of good and evil and right and wrong --
are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
And , consequently , most people -- I think most people
probably here -- think that science will never answer
that this is an illusion -- that the separation between
cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values ,
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
that can tell us how the world ought to be .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more
than we are about insects , as indeed we are ,
it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range
This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
even if you think that good and evil ultimately
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
And to say that such changes can persist after death
which , of course , may or may not be true .
we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state ,
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --
where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration ,
And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum
to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye ,
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --
But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being
we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife ,
in the context of a maturing science of the mind --
of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape ,
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called
Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access
Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying
or that we will have scientific answers to every
I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult
a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child ,
or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
just admitting that there are right and wrong answers
For instance , there are 21 states in our country
where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard ,
and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes
in such a way that not being able to run a marathon
at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
Notice that the fact that the concept of health
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape :
there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society
I would never be tempted to argue to you
that there must be one right food to eat .
to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie ,
well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
The fact that there are exceptions here does not
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves
that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
Well this is one thing you can do about them :
Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community
And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong
if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --
women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute :
and what you want to do is kill her .
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the
this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere
it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot;
there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
But the thing to notice is that there will be
many more ways not to be on a peak .
is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me
and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions
because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind ,
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes
as a lens through which most people view moral questions
But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion
in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning
and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component
On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ;
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping
So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion
and say , &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama
to be really right about -- really right about --
or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other
in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference
It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to
Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ;
I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise ,
So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
We live in a world filled with destructive technology ,
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world ,
hearing some of this , may well be doing the
I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
And some of them would say something else . They would say ,
it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; --
and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --
with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence ,
and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way
or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face --
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want ,
And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this
I think I understood you to say that you could
one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
100 years forward , how you would like to think of
that we are on the path toward understanding our minds
at the level of the brain in some important detail ,
that we are going to understand all of the positive
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
in the context of men who do desire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know
we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
CA : And if the results come out that actually they do ,
are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment
in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
So , you can say like , &quot; Because I knew my gay son
was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend ,
I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot;
yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to
We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
I took the course or the discipline of entomology ,
And then I thought , myself , how can I be practical
And then I moved to the world of plant protection --
or these good bugs that we are talking about ,
they &apos;ve existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years ,
or people knew more and more how to exploit , or how to use ,
Just take a magnifying glass . You see what I have here ?
You just twist leaves , and you see a whole new world
or little spiders of one millimeter , one and a half ,
and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones .
and we need to know how to exploit it .
What damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
or the good bug , that we are talking about ?
Here is a pest , devastating pest , a spider mite ,
because it does a lot of webbing like a spider .
and two daughters , probably on the left and right ,
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict .
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf ,
and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .
This is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite , by the way ,
one millimeter , two millimeters long , not more than that ,
And here you can see this lady in action
the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite .
And after five minutes , this is what you see :
By the way , a meal for them for 24 hours
you can see those bad ones , those aphids , all over the plants ,
By the way , with aphids you have only females ,
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .
And here you can see this parasite in action ,
in front of the victim at the right-hand side ,
will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid .
This is the visual result of a dead aphid
that after a few minutes you see halfway out .
You can see , by the way , in different movies , etc . ,
And if this is a female , she &apos;ll immediately mate with a male
and off she goes because time is very short .
This female can live only three to four days ,
And this is of course not the end of it .
There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies
I didn &apos;t bother you with the Latin names of these creatures ,
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper .
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable
Here you can see the adult , black , and two young ones .
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs , the good ones ,
So this is a very positive situation , by the way .
No harm to the developing fruit . No harm to the fruit set .
here you saw them on a one-to-one basis --
By the way , they have a very nice landscape --
you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand
You see in the upper left corner , you see a single predatory mite .
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .
And we can produce from this , believe you me ,
in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel
In this table , you can actually see what is an impact
By the way , the number of answers you get
But if we go , for example , to this place ,
especially under greenhouse conditions , or under screenhouse conditions --
if you drive all the way to Eilat , you see this
this is the number one answer that we get from growers ,
It &apos;s the same , and it can happen very quickly .
Finally , I want to get actually to my vision ,
I think it &apos;s times 100 or something like that .
How can we bridge , or let &apos;s say , narrow , this gap
First of all , we need to find more robust ,
And thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers
All we are saying , we can actually sing it :
So I &apos;m saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol
I think all of us have been interested , at one time or another ,
in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed ,
such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan , the Easter Islanders ,
the Anasazi , Fertile Crescent society , Angor Wat , Great Zimbabwe
and so on . And within the last decade or two ,
archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems
But there were also plenty of places in the world
where societies have been developing for thousands of years
such as Japan , Java , Tonga and Tikopea . So evidently , societies
in some areas are more fragile than in other areas .
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile
to our situation today , because today as well , there are
some societies that have already collapsed , such as Somalia
and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia . There are also
societies today that may be close to collapse , such as Nepal , Indonesia and Columbia .
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid
declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ?
Obviously the answer to this question is not going
to be a single factor . If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor
that they &apos;re an idiot . This is a complex subject .
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject ?
five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through
to try and understand collapses . And I &apos;ll illustrate that five-point
framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society .
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation .
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland , settled Greenland ,
and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed ,
Why did they all end up dead ? Well , in my five-point framework ,
the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts
base on which they depend . And in the case of the Viking Norse ,
they required forests to make charcoal , to make iron .
So they ended up an Iron Age European society , virtually
unable to make their own iron . A second item on my checklist is
climate change . Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter .
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland , the climate got colder
in the late 1300s , and especially in the 1400s . But a cold climate
isn &apos;t necessarily fatal , because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting
Greenland at the same time -- did better , rather than worse ,
with cold climates . So why didn &apos;t the Greenland Norse as well ?
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring
friendly societies that may prop up a society . And if that
friendly support is pulled away , that may make a society
more likely to collapse . In the case of the Greenland Norse ,
they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --
and that trade dwindled : partly because Norway got weaker ,
partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway .
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
In the case of Norse Greenland , the hostiles were the Inuit --
the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse
got off to bad relationships . And we know that the Inuit
may have blocked access to the outer fjords , on which
the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year .
And then finally , the fifth item on my checklist is the political ,
economic , social and cultural factors in the society that make it
more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its
environmental problems . In the case of the Greenland Norse ,
to solve their problems were : their commitments to a
a competitive-ranked chiefly society ; and their scorn for the Inuit ,
from whom they refused to learn . So that &apos;s how the five-part
framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse .
For the past five years , I &apos;ve been taking my wife and kids to
on the hay harvest . And Montana , at first sight , seems
like the most pristine environment in the United States .
But scratch the surface , and Montana suffers from serious problems .
Yes , acute in Montana . Toxic problems from mine waste
200 million dollars a year . Montana has lost agricultural areas
problems of forest fires . Second item on my checklist :
climate change . Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer
and drier , but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation
from the snow pack , and as the snow is melting -- for example ,
as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --
that can sustain the society . In Montana today , more than half of
the income of Montana is not earned within Montana ,
but is derived from out of state : transfer payments from
which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States .
Fourth : relations with hostiles . Montanans have the same problems
as do all Americans , in being sensitive to problems
and terrorist attacks . And finally , last item on my checklist :
play into this . Montanans have long-held values , which today
seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems .
Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture ,
and to no government regulation ; values that worked well
in the past , but they don &apos;t seem to be working well today .
for a lot of past societies and for many present societies .
In a way , just like Tolstoy &apos;s statement about every unhappy marriage
being different , every collapsed or endangered society is different --
they all have different details . But nevertheless , there are certain
of past societies that did or did not collapse
has to do with , in many cases , the rapidity of collapse
after a society reaches its peak . There are many societies
that don &apos;t wind down gradually , but they build up -- get richer
and more powerful -- and then within a short time , within a few decades
the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the
early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building
Or again , the collapse of the Soviet Union took place
within a couple of decades , maybe within a decade , of the time
when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power .
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish .
or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential .
In a petri dish , bacteria grow . Say they double every generation ,
and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15 / 16ths empty ,
and then the next generation &apos;s 3 / 4ths empty , and the next generation
half empty . Within one generation after the petri dish still
being half empty , it is full . There &apos;s no more food and the bacteria have collapsed .
societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power .
What it means to put it mathematically is that , if you &apos;re concerned
about a society today , you should be looking not at the value
of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should
be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives
of the function . That &apos;s one general theme . A second general theme
is that there are many , often subtle environmental factors that make
some societies more fragile than others . Many of those factors
are not well understood . For example , why is it that in the Pacific ,
of those hundreds of Pacific islands , why did Easter Island end up as
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental
factors -- some , rather subtle ones -- that were working against
the Easter Islanders , and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra ,
is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from
Easter , of all Pacific islands , has the least input of dust
from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils . But that &apos;s
a factor that we didn &apos;t even appreciate until 1999 .
of societies . What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is ,
how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment ?
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree ?
Didn &apos;t they see what they were doing ? How could societies
not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ?
And I would expect that , if our human civilization carries on ,
then maybe in the next century people will be asking ,
why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see
the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?
It seems incredible in the past . In the future , it &apos;ll seem
incredible what we are doing today . And so I &apos;ve been
about why societies fail to solve their problems --
why they fail to perceive the problems or , if they perceive them ,
why they fail to tackle them . Or , if they tackle them ,
why do they fail to succeed in solving them ?
is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term
interest of the society as a whole , especially if the elites
of their actions . Where what &apos;s good in the short run for the elite
is bad for the society as a whole , there &apos;s a real risk of the elite
doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .
a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted
is more followers and more sheep and more resources
to outcompete the neighboring chiefs . And that led the chiefs
to do what &apos;s called flogging the land : overstocking the land ,
but led to the society &apos;s collapse in the long run .
Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute
the decision makers in the United States are frequently
by living in gated compounds , by drinking bottled water
and so on . And within the last couple of years ,
it &apos;s been obvious that the elite in the business world
good for them but bad for society as a whole ,
such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron
that these things are good for them in the short term ,
And the other generalization that I want to mention
is that it &apos;s particularly hard for a society to make
quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving
strongly held values that are good in many circumstances
and by their strong social cohesion . But those two things --
also made it difficult for them to change at the end
and to learn from the Inuit . Or today -- Australia .
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive
is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt
to their situation in Asia . So it &apos;s particularly difficult
to change course when the things that get you in trouble
are the things that are also the source of your strength .
Well , all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs
going on in the modern world , time bombs that have fuses
of a few decades to -- all of them , not more than 50 years ,
and any one of which can do us in ; the time bombs of water ,
the photosynthetic ceiling , population problems , toxics , etc . , etc . --
listing about 12 of them . And while these time bombs --
none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years , and most of them
have fuses of a few decades -- some of them , in some places ,
have much shorter fuses . At the rate at which we &apos;re going now ,
the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest
within five years . And the Solomon Islands are only
which is their major export . And that &apos;s going to be spectacular
for the economy of the Solomons . People often ask me ,
Jared , what &apos;s the most important thing that we need to do
And my answer is , the most important thing we need to do
is to forget about there being any single thing that is
Instead , there are a dozen things , any one of which could do us in .
And we &apos;ve got to get them all right , because if we solve 11,
we fail to solve the 12th -- we &apos;re in trouble . For example ,
if we solve our problems of water and soil and population ,
but don &apos;t solve our problems of toxics , then we are in trouble .
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course ,
which means , by definition , that it cannot be maintained .
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades .
That means that those of us in this room who are less than
50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved ,
and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see
the resolution , but our children and grandchildren certainly will .
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms :
in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action ,
or else these conflicts are going to get settled
in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely , by war ,
disease or starvation . But what &apos;s for sure is that our
non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another
in a few decades . In other words , since the theme of this session
is choices , we have a choice . Does that mean that we should
get pessimistic and overwhelmed ? I draw the reverse conclusion .
The big problems facing the world today are not at all
things beyond our control . Our biggest threat is not an asteroid
about to crash into us , something we can do nothing about .
Instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems
entirely of our own making . And since we made the problems ,
we can also solve the problems . That then means that it &apos;s
entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
In particular , what can all of us do ? For those of you
who are interested in these choices , there are lots of things
you can do . There &apos;s a lot that we don &apos;t understand ,
and that we need to understand . And there &apos;s a lot that
we already do understand , but aren &apos;t doing , and that
I don &apos;t know what the hell I &apos;m doing here .
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada ,
and dropped out of high school . I don &apos;t own a cell phone ,
and I paint on paper using gouache , which hasn &apos;t changed in 600 years .
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York ,
So I think I &apos;m actually the first one here -- I lead .
I called it &quot; Serious Nonsense &quot; because on the serious side ,
I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration
from when I was a kid . I copied it and I never unlearned it --
it &apos;s the only style I know . And it &apos;s very kind of staid and formal .
And meanwhile , I use nonsense , as you can see .
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors ,
and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor --
This was one of a series called &quot; Zany Afternoons , &quot; which became a book .
This is a home-built rocket-propelled car . That &apos;s a 1953 Henry J --
I &apos;m a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo .
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film .
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town .
that I have to invent my own lexicon for it .
And I work a lot in what I call &quot; retrofuturism , &quot;
which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow .
And the peak time for that was the 30s ,
that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
This is Popular Workbench . Popular science magazines in those days --
I had a huge collection of them from the &apos; 30s --
all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses
playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour --
it &apos;s all going to happen , it &apos;s all going to be wonderful .
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter ,
so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject .
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half .
This is the &apos; 58 Bulgemobile : so new , they make tomorrow look like yesterday .
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car .
That &apos;s from a whole catalog -- it &apos;s 18 pages or so --
ran back in the days of the Lampoon , where I cut my teeth .
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened --
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark ,
and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it .
So the Hindenburg wasn &apos;t , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go .
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s .
The auto-gyro couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the helicopter ,
but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
It &apos;s the only Spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream .
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car .
looking at the day all American families have them .
Faux-nostalgia , which I &apos;m sort of -- not , say , famous for , but I work an awful lot in it .
It &apos;s the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion --
so I think that &apos;s a case for serious play .
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining ,
recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s ,
dining on the wing of a plane . You can &apos;t see it very well here ,
but that &apos;s Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel
to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away .
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . I do a lot of that .
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense .
Those , for example , are Mark IV British tanks from 1916 .
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark .
And they had a canary hung inside the thing
to make sure the Germans weren &apos;t going to use gas .
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s ,
where you drove up to your front door , if you had the guts .
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm .
And I love cigars -- there &apos;s a cigar billboard down there .
And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war .
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,
when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons
and buzzes around , just to piss off Churchill , who &apos;s down there somewhere .
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit ,
just for the fun of it . This was a piece I did -- a brochure again --
&quot; RMS Tyrannic : The Biggest Thing in All the World . &quot;
The copy , which you can &apos;t see because it goes on and on for several pages ,
says that steerage passengers can &apos;t get their to bunks before the voyage is over ,
But it &apos;s not a cri de coeur about man &apos;s hubris in the face of the elements .
Shamelessly cheap is something , I think -- this will wake you up .
It has no meaning , just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi ,
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page
for an issue of the Lampoon , and I did that ,
and I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m ashamed . I hope nobody knows it . &quot;
Urban absurdism -- that &apos;s what the New Yorker really calls for .
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers .
I &apos;ve done about 40 of them , and I &apos;d say 30 of them are based on that concept .
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m. ,
and this steam pouring out of the street , and I thought , &quot; What causes that ? &quot; And that --
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it &apos;s a very somber place .
I thought I could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it .
This is a very un-PC cover . Not in New York .
I couldn &apos;t resist , and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying ,
&quot; This is too serious and solemn to make fun of . You should be ashamed ,
Haven &apos;t got around to it yet but -- I may .
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France .
If you live in New York , you know how the bike messengers move .
Except that he &apos;s carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do --
and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist
about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France --
This is the only fashion cover I &apos;ve ever done .
It &apos;s the little old lady that lives in a shoe , and then this thing --
the title of that was , &quot; There Goes the Neighborhood . &quot;
I don &apos;t know a hell of a lot about fashion --
I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane ,
and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying :
because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it &apos;s bad and --
I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe .
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass . One letter makes an idea .
People always ask me , where do you get your ideas , how do your ideas come ?
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover ,
in the middle of the night , this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down .
It was perfectly clear . I didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
And then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg --
if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet .
Her former name was Fay Wray , and so that was --
I didn &apos;t have the wit to say , &quot; Take the painting . &quot;
Finally , this was a three-page cover , never done before ,
and I don &apos;t think it will ever be done again --
It &apos;s the ascent of man using an escalator , and it &apos;s in three parts .
You can &apos;t see it all together , unfortunately , but if you look at it enough ,
you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move .
Pretty elegant . Nothing like a crash to end a joke . That completes my oeuvre .
I would just like to add a crass commercial --
I have a kids &apos; book coming out in the fall called &quot; Marvel Sandwiches , &quot;
a compendium of all the serious play that ever was ,
and it &apos;s going to be available in fine bookstores , crummy bookstores ,
And I would like to know what the audience is ,
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
There &apos;s six million species of insects on this planet ,
In fact , if we count all the individual organisms ,
it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms
a contribution to the economy of the United States for free .
And so I looked up what the economy was paying
A third of all the fruits that we eat
of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants .
And at the end of the food chain , we are eating them as well .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
in a small , provincial town in China , Lijiang --
If you go out for dinner , like in a fish restaurant ,
where you can select which fish you want to eat ,
you can select which insects you would like to eat .
in this provincial town in China they &apos;re doing that , but not us .
Well we &apos;ve seen already that quite some of you
but I can tell you that every one of you
If they don &apos;t have any damage , they go to the grocery .
But there &apos;s tomatoes that end up in a soup ,
there can be all kinds of things in there ,
In fact , why would we put these balls in the soup ,
&quot; Okay , so we &apos;re eating 500 grams just by accident . &quot;
In a lot of food items that we have --
a lot of our food products that are of a red color
&#91; of &#93; crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat ,
Now the situation in the world is going to change
for you and me , for everyone on this Earth .
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed ,
and this is something that worries more and more people .
And if you look at the figures up there ,
it says that we have a third more mouths to feed ,
and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more
Our diet consists , &#91; in &#93; some part , of animal proteins ,
And of course , we are not there to say
and I know , I &apos;ve been a vegetarian for a long time ,
You &apos;ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
and we &apos;re being faced with that more and more often .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
That means that pigs also share diseases with us .
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
We eat insects -- they &apos;re so distantly related from us
but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat .
you can get either one or nine kg. of output .
the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign
and in terms of protein , or fat , or vitamins ,
to anything we eat as meat at the moment .
And even in terms of calories , it is very good .
and I could make many more points for insects ,
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
where the feed is being produced and being transported .
And if you remember that we need to increase
On the left-hand side , you see a market in Laos
all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
There are a few people who don &apos;t like shrimp ,
In fact , a locust is a &quot; shrimp &quot; of the land ,
and it would make very good into our diet .
and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us .
And I &apos;m working very hard with my colleague , Arnold van Huis ,
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .
And some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them ,
and one of them is here in the audience ,
I predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the supermarkets --
you &apos;ll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you &apos;re going to eat .
And they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
Well in the Netherlands , we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture ,
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
A couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects ,
And I &apos;m going to show to Bruno some first tries ,
Bruno Giussani : Look at them first . Look at them first .
BG : That &apos;s exactly the same &#91; one &#93; you saw in the video actually .
Allison Hunt : My three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
Chris Anderson : No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes .
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago .
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery .
unless you &apos;re David Bolinsky , in which case it &apos;s all truth and beauty .
Sure David , if it &apos;s not your hip , it &apos;s truth and beauty .
Anyway , I did have a really big epiphany around the situation ,
so Chris invited me to tell you about it .
But first you need to know two things about me .
I &apos;m Canadian , and I &apos;m the youngest of seven kids .
Now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system .
That means we get our new hips for free .
I have never been at the front of the line for anything . OK ?
So my hip had been hurting me for years .
I finally went to the doctor , which was free .
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free .
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year .
I met the surgeon , and he took some free X-rays ,
and I got a good look at them . And you know ,
So he said , &quot; Allison , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table .
I &apos;m going to replace your hip -- it &apos;s about an 18-month wait . &quot;
I &apos;d already waited 10 months , and I had to wait 18 more months .
You know , it &apos;s such a long wait that I actually
started to even think about it in terms of TEDs .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa .
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 .
I would still be on my bad hip . That was so disappointing .
So , I left his office and I was walking through the hospital ,
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
We don &apos;t talk about it . It &apos;s not even a consideration .
In fact , when we &apos;re traveling abroad , it &apos;s how we identify fellow Canadians .
Hey , are you from Canada ? &quot; Oh , me too ! Hi ! &quot;
So no , suddenly I wasn &apos;t averse to butting any geezer off the list .
So by now I was walking the lobby , and of course , that hurt ,
because of my hip , and I kind of needed a sign .
In the window of the hospital &apos;s tiny gift shop there was a sign
No reference checks . None of the usual background stuff , no .
because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .
So , next thing you know , I had my bright blue volunteer vest ,
I had my photo ID , and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss .
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop .
Then I &apos;d tell them , &quot; Well , I &apos;m getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months .
It &apos;s gonna be so great when the pain stops . Ow ! &quot;
All the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer .
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification .
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
Moments later , I had a surgery date just weeks away ,
Now , word on the street was that it was actually
my volunteering that got me to the front of the line .
And , you know , I &apos;m not even ashamed of that .
First of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hip .
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering ,
which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all .
they do it in a way that benefits society .
make us smarter and more connected to the world .
And to really illustrate this point , what I &apos;d like to do
is to show you how technology has dealt with
a very simple , a very common , an everyday question .
If you glance at your iPhone , it &apos;s so simple to tell the time .
But , I &apos;d like to ask you , how would you tell the time
How would you tell the time , say , 600 years ago ?
Well , the way you would do it is by using a device
So , an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today &apos;s world .
And it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
So , the different parts of the astrolabe , in this particular type ,
the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars .
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together .
you would know how to not only use the astrolabe ,
you would also know how to make an astrolabe .
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe ,
And in this book , little Lewis would know the big idea .
And the central idea that makes this computer work
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe ,
and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
onto a flat surface , where it is then recorded .
So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device .
The ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets
The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete .
Now , the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection .
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems
There is the position of the sun , moon and planets on the movable rete .
And then there is their location on the sky
as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate . Okay ?
Well , let me first back up for a moment .
And so , this astrolabe is on loan from us
from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History .
This is the mater , the scales on the back .
This is the rete . Okay . Do you see that ?
And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky .
This is a rule device . And on the back
and scales , to be able to make some calculations . Okay ?
For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper .
But a real one would cost about as much as my house ,
and the house next to it , and actually every house on the block ,
maybe a school thrown in , and some -- you know , a church .
But let me show you how to work this device .
First thing that you do is you select a star
in the night sky , if you &apos;re telling time at night .
So , tonight , if it &apos;s clear you &apos;ll be able to see the summer triangle .
And there is a bright star called Deneb . So let &apos;s select Deneb .
So , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . You can &apos;t see it from over there .
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device .
move the sky , so the altitude of the star
holding a model of the universe in my hands .
&quot; That &apos;s a lot of work , isn &apos;t it ? Isn &apos;t it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ? &quot;
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time .
But there is a difference between the two , because with your iPod
you can tell -- or your iPhone , you can tell exactly
He would know where things would fit in the sky .
He would not only know what time it was ,
he would also know where the sun would rise ,
He would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set .
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object
that allow us to perform an action with it .
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us ,
it affords us , to connect to the night sky ,
to look up into the night sky and be much more --
In fact , there is a text , and that has over a thousand uses
You can survey with it . The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it .
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types .
And it would take a full university course to illustrate it .
There is portable ones . There is large display ones .
And I think what is common to all astrolabes
So , the earliest retes , for example , were very simple and primitive .
And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern
and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical , or random sky .
Probably not one made of brass . He would have one made out of wood ,
or paper . And the vast majority of this first computer
that you could keep in the back of your pocket .
And what we gain with a new technology , of course ,
Knowing the sky , knowing your relationship with the sky ,
So , it &apos;s -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices .
And so , what can you learn from these devices ?
So , the first robot to talk about is called STriDER .
So , you know H.G. Wells &apos; &quot; War of the Worlds , &quot; novel and movie .
And what you see over here is a very popular
and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that
are robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth .
But my robot , STriDER , does not move like this .
I &apos;m just going to show you how the robot works .
and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall .
So , that &apos;s how it walks . But when you look at us
what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re not really using a muscle
to lift your leg and walk like a robot . Right ?
What you &apos;re doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall ,
stand up again , swing your leg and catch the fall .
You &apos;re using your built-in dynamics , the physics of your body ,
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
So , even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this ,
to this robot . Thus it &apos;s a biologically inspired robot .
What you see over here , this is what we want to do next .
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like &quot; Star Wars &quot; --
when it lands , it absorbs the shock and starts walking .
What you see over here , this yellow thing , this is not a death ray .
This is just to show you that if you have cameras
because it is tall , it &apos;s 1.8 meters tall --
you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things .
The first version , in the back , that &apos;s STriDER I.
The one in front , the smaller , is STriDER II .
The problem that we had with STriDER I is
it was just too heavy in the body . We had so many motors ,
you know , aligning the joints , and those kinds of things .
so we could get rid of all the motors , and with a single motor
It &apos;s a mechanical solution to a problem , instead of using mechatronics .
So , with this now the top body is light enough . So , it &apos;s walking in our lab ;
It &apos;s still not perfected -- its coffee falls down --
so we still have a lot of work to do .
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS .
but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub ;
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet ,
a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes .
in this case , this obstacle is more than three times
and camera systems , to identify the obstacle and the size ,
and it plans , carefully plans the motion of the spokes
and coordinates it so that it can show this
You probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
when you steer your car , you use a method
where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction .
For IMPASS , we can do many , many different types of motion .
For example , in this case , even though the left and right wheel is connected
with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity .
We just simply change the length of the spoke .
It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right .
So , these are just some examples of the neat things
So , I &apos;ve been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --
at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers --
So , inspired by that we wanted to build a robot
So , what it does , it has three legs . It &apos;s probably difficult to see ,
but it has a winch and a cable at the top --
and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot .
how much force it needs to exert to the surface
and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing .
Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR .
So , this is actually based on that . This robot is called MARS :
We actually have a very interesting payload on there .
The students like to have fun . And here you can see that it &apos;s
but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand
So , it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things .
And also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine .
So , when the visitors come , MARS walks up to the computer ,
Now , we don &apos;t have enough time to go into technical details ,
So , this is some of the early feasibility experiments .
We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move .
Or use an active tension cords to make it move
This robot is a very recent project . It &apos;s called RAPHaEL .
There are a lot of really neat , very good robotic hands out there in the market .
The problem is they &apos;re just too expensive , tens of thousands of dollars .
So , for prosthesis applications it &apos;s probably not too practical ,
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .
It is compliant . You can actually change the force ,
And it can actually crush an empty soda can .
It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg ,
The best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype .
This robot is actually a family of snake robots
And this student , probably the first time using it ,
So , for example in Iraq , you know , the war zone ,
It takes really a lot of time and it &apos;s expensive
to train the operator to operate this complex arm .
this student , probably his first time using it , doing very complex manipulation tasks ,
We actually have a fan club for the robot , DARwIn :
so we decided to build a small humanoid robot .
Is it even possible ? What kinds of controls should we do ?
For those who probably know , if you don &apos;t have any sensors
and there are any disturbances , you know what happens .
it has a cord , umbilical cord . So , we &apos;re still using an external power source
So , in 2006 , now it &apos;s really time to have fun .
Let &apos;s give it intelligence . We give it all the computing power it needs :
four force sensors on the foot , lithium polymer batteries .
There are no tethers . It looks around , searches for the ball ,
looks around , searches for the ball , and it tries to play a game of soccer ,
Let &apos;s see how it does . This was our very first trial ,
Dennis Hong : So , there is actually a competition called RoboCup .
I don &apos;t know how many of you have heard about RoboCup .
And the goal of RoboCup , the actual goal is ,
we want to have full size , autonomous humanoid robots
It &apos;s a true actual goal . It &apos;s a very ambitious goal ,
but we truly believe that we can do it .
We were the very first team in the United States that qualified
You &apos;re going to see the action , three against three ,
What you see over here , this is the beautiful
and we would like to bring this for the very first time , to the United States
Last year it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV .
And again , you &apos;ll be able to see it in the lobby .
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running
humanoid robot in the United States . So , stay tuned .
All right . So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work .
that can drive into urban environments . We won a half a million dollars
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge , very exciting .
And many , many other robotics projects I want to talk about .
These are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall
At night when I go to bed , 3 - 4 a.m. in the morning ,
I lie down , close my eyes , and I see these lines and circles
And they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms .
So , right next to my bed I keep a notebook ,
a journal , with a special pen that has a light on it , LED light ,
because I don &apos;t want to turn on the light and wake up my wife .
So , I see this , scribble everything down , draw things ,
the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee ,
before I brush my teeth , I open my notebook .
sometimes I have something there -- if something &apos;s there , sometimes it &apos;s junk --
but most of the time I can &apos;t even read my handwriting .
And so , 4 am in the morning , what do you expect , right ?
But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there ,
I directly run to my home office , sit at my computer ,
I type in the ideas , I sketch things out
and the problem . If there is a match we write a research proposal ,
get the research funding in , and that &apos;s how we start our research programs .
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
At our lab RoMeLa , the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory ,
But before we start we set this golden rule .
This is important , because many times students , they fear
They have these wacky , cool , crazy , brilliant ideas , and
the whole room is just electrified with creative energy .
Well , we &apos;re running out of time . One more thing I want to talk about is ,
you know , just a spark of idea and development is not good enough .
I think it was Sir Ken Robinson , was it ?
Well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
So , there is only so much one can do
if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics
we need more than that . This is where school comes in .
he has his utility belt , he has his grappling hook ,
these tools , these are the courses and classes you take in class .
for us , more tools to attack these kinds of big problems .
only about that . You also have to work really , really hard .
This picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning .
I guarantee if you come to your lab at 3 - 4 am
not because I tell them to , but because we are having too much fun .
That &apos;s really the secret of our success , we &apos;re having too much fun .
I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you &apos;re having fun ,
and of what design might do to improve both .
So here &apos;s North Carolina , and if we zoom in ,
Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state .
is home to just 20,000 people , and they &apos;re very sparsely distributed .
where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back .
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now
and yet 20 percent of our population lives there .
So Bertie County is not only very rural ; it &apos;s incredibly poor .
It has one in three of its children living in poverty ,
and it &apos;s what is referred to as a &quot; rural ghetto . &quot;
and we &apos;re very proud of our Bertie County peanut .
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant .
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you &apos;re looking at right now .
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair
You can count the number of restaurants in the county
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop ,
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class ,
and you can see the difference is pretty stark .
and only eight percent of the people in the county
only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders
So it sounds like I &apos;m painting a really bleak picture of this place ,
one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man :
He started some of the country &apos;s first charter schools
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary ,
and he is the reason that I now live and work there .
which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --
to come to Bertie and to partner with him
and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .
So at the time of being invited down there ,
And when I say we , I mean Project H ,
but more specifically , I mean myself and my partner , Matthew Miller ,
who &apos;s an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder .
So fast-forward to today , and we now live there .
I have strategically cut Matt &apos;s head out of this photo ,
because he would kill me if he knew I was using it
But this is our front porch . We live there .
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth ,
we realized we had fallen in love with the place .
We had fallen in love with the place and the people
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there ,
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County .
There isn &apos;t a single licensed architect in the whole county .
and to be sort of the -- to usher that in
as a new type of tool in their tool kit .
within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --
So the goal became , yes , to apply design within education ,
but then to figure out how to make education
So in order to do this , we &apos;ve taken three different approaches
And I should say that these are three things that we &apos;ve done in Bertie County ,
but I feel pretty confident that they could work
So the first of the three is design for education .
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers
and the terrible materials that we &apos;re building schools out of these days .
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways .
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs .
where they have to benchmark test every other week ,
You come in , you face the wall , you take your test and you leave .
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology ,
So this is the lab at the high school ,
and the principal there is in love with this room .
Every time he has visitors , it &apos;s the first place that he takes them .
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers
and running around and screaming and being a kid .
So this game that the kids are playing here --
And in Match Me , you take the class , divide it into two teams ,
and the teacher will take a piece of chalk
and just write a number on each of the tires .
And then she &apos;ll call out a math problem --
and then one student from each team has to compete
to figure out that four times four is 16
and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it .
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores ,
So with design for education , I think the most important thing
is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers ,
so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them .
So this is Mr. Perry . He &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
He came out for one of our teacher-training days
and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself .
So in many cases this is not so much about making change
which is easier said than done in rural communities
So for us , this was a graphic public campaign
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county .
And this was for a fund that the school district had
to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection
are in the school buildings , or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint ,
which I find myself squatting outside of a lot .
and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place ,
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls
and to think about how they could play a role
around how we might connect the classroom and the home
And then the third approach , which is what I &apos;m most excited about ,
that we could actually teach design within public schools ,
not like &quot; let &apos;s learn physics by building a rocket , &quot;
It also means that designers are no longer consultants ,
that so many of these school districts are plagued by .
and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning
and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --
intended for kids who aren &apos;t going to go to college .
let &apos;s make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas .
And in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class
So we thought , what if you could bring back shop class ,
and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year
offered at the high school level to the junior class .
just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process
of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it .
the students spend three hours a day every single day
from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding ,
and then moving into the shop and actually testing them ,
figuring out if they are going to work and refining that .
And then over the summer , they &apos;re offered a summer job .
So the first project , which will be built next summer ,
followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year
and home improvements for the elderly in the third year .
that hopefully the students can point to and say ,
So I want you to meet three of our students .
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher .
She wants to go to college , but she wants to come back to Bertie County ,
because that &apos;s where her family is from , where she calls home ,
to this place that she &apos;s been fairly fortunate in .
so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .
This is Eric . He plays for the football team .
a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect ,
He is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside
so if he ends up not going to college ,
What design and building really offers to public education
which may very well become the site of our future farmers &apos; market ,
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer
when they have built the farmers &apos; market and it &apos;s open to the public --
And for the community , what design and building offers
So we recognize that Studio H , especially in its first year ,
But we feel like this could work in other places .
And I really , strongly believe in the power of the small story ,
you lose the ability to view people as humans .
for the people that we work with and for
And let &apos;s face it , designers , we need to reinvent ourselves .
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter ,
we need to work outside of our comfort zones more ,
and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard .
we hope that it represents a step in the right direction
that if you are older than four or five years of age ,
the chances of your brain learning how to see
So let me first start with the personal reason .
So I felt that I needed to do two things .
in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish ,
And I want to show you a short video clip
that illustrates the first two components of this work .
Pawan Sinha : So , because this is a school for the blind ,
So , after that screening , we bring the children to the hospital .
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash . )
PS : So , as I zoom in to the eyes of this child ,
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils
but in this child , the lens has become opaque ,
So , the child is given treatment . You &apos;ll see shots of the eye .
So , even from that little clip , you can begin to get the sense
even if you have a person who got sight
about this woman that you see on the right , SRD ,
I should add a tragic postscript to this --
So , hers is just a truly inspiring story --
as you might imagine , it created quite a bit of stir
So , we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --
let &apos;s say we find a child who has light sensitivity .
We treat many more children then we actually work with .
And we try to do this for as long as possible .
So , any image of the kind that you see on the left ,
be it a real image or a synthetic image ,
and that &apos;s the question we asked with Project Prakash .
Here &apos;s a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago ,
and you see Ethan Myers , a graduate student from MIT ,
of what are the regions that he &apos;s trying to trace out .
if you show others like him real world images ,
they are unable to recognize most of the objects
&quot; Even if you can &apos;t name the objects , just point to where the objects are , &quot;
and that &apos;s what I want to show you in the next clip .
PS : And we see this pattern over and over again .
that motion is so important for the human visual system ,
that can learn on their own , that don &apos;t need to be programmed
I &apos;m at MIT , at MIT you need to apply
of the same kind that a human child would receive ,
The way we test Dylan is by giving it
that a baby , or a child in Project Prakash would get .
But for a long time we couldn &apos;t quite figure out :
Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan ?
I had to have long conversations with my wife .
How does that happen ? We want Dylan to be able to do that ,
with just about six or seven minutes worth of video ,
The clinical implication , it comes from the domain of autism .
So , while the child is playing Pong , we are tracking where they &apos;re looking .
This is the neurotypical child , and what you see
is that the child is able to make cues
to predict where the ball is going to go .
the child always follows where the ball has been .
The red dots are the children we have not treated .
So , there are many , many more children who need to be treated ,
and in order to expand the scope of the project ,
to be greater than the sum of the parts .
So , to summarize : Prakash , in its five years of existence ,
helping the many children that we have worked with .
SS : Aimee and I thought we &apos;d just talk a little bit ,
and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete .
AM : Well , for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio --
I &apos;m a double amputee , and I was born without fibulas in both legs .
and I &apos;ve been running like hell ever since , all over the place .
SS : Well , why don &apos;t you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don &apos;t we start there ?
AM : I &apos;m a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program .
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school .
They pick three students out of the nation every year
and so I won a full ride to Georgetown
and I &apos;ve been there for four years . Love it .
she decided that she &apos;s , kind of , curious about track and field ,
so she decided to call someone and start asking about it .
AM : Yeah . Well , I guess I &apos;ve always been involved in sports .
because I wasn &apos;t doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise .
And I &apos;d never competed on a disabled level , you know --
In fact , I &apos;d never even met another amputee until I was 17 .
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners ,
and I figured , &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know about this ,
but before I judge it , let me go see what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
So , I booked myself a flight to Boston in &apos; 95 , 19 years old
and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race . I &apos;d never done it before .
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet
and about 50 meters was enough for me , panting and heaving .
And I had these legs that were made of
a wood and plastic compound , attached with Velcro straps --
you know , not the most comfortable things , but all I &apos;d ever known .
wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite
and , you know , shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things --
OK , we know who &apos;s not going to win this race .
And , I mean , I went up there expecting --
but , you know , when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg
go up to the high jump , hop on one leg to the high jump
and clear it at six feet , two inches ...
I mean , if it just gives you a comparison of --
And so I decided to give this a shot : heart pounding ,
I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder
and became the new national record-holder on my first try out .
&quot; Aimee , you know , you &apos;ve got speed -- you &apos;ve got natural speed --
but you don &apos;t have any skill or finesse going down that track .
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown .
And I thank god I didn &apos;t know just how huge this man is in the track and field world .
the man &apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling
And I called him up and said , &quot; Listen , I ran one race and I won ... &quot;
&quot; I want to see if I can , you know --
I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices ,
&quot; Can I just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , we should meet first , before we decide anything . &quot;
You know , he &apos;s thinking , &quot; What am I getting myself into ? &quot;
So , I met the man , walked in his office ,
and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached .
and it turned out to be a great partnership
So this was like , &quot; Here we go -- let &apos;s start on this trip . &quot;
So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break ,
his free time , and I would come up to the track and train with him .
That was fall of &apos; 95 . But then , by the time that winter was rolling around ,
You can run on our women &apos;s track team here . &quot;
In the spring of 1996 , with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team
that May coming up full speed , I joined the women &apos;s track team .
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .
So I don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
AM : Yes , well , you know , I &apos;d won everything as far as the disabled meets --
everything I competed in -- and , you know , training in Georgetown
and knowing that I was going to have to get used to
seeing the backs of all these women &apos;s shirts --
you know , I &apos;m running against the next Flo-Jo --
and going out there and knowing that , you know ,
in order to become better -- and I &apos;m already the best in the country --
you know , you have to train with people who are inherently better than you .
And I went out there and made it to the Big East ,
which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season .
I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio ,
the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock --
and I &apos;d be , kind of , pistoning in the socket .
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint , in all my glory ,
Like , I almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people .
because I was signed up for the 200 , you know , which went off in a half hour .
I went to my coach : &quot; Please , don &apos;t make me do this . &quot;
I can &apos;t do this in front of all those people . My legs will come off .
And if it came off at 85 there &apos;s no way I &apos;m going 200 meters .
he &apos;s a big man . He says , &quot; Aimee , so what if your leg falls off ?
You pick it up , you put the damn thing back on ,
And I did . So , he kept me in line .
SS : So , then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics ,
and she &apos;s all excited . Her family &apos;s coming down -- it &apos;s a big deal .
SS : A year . And why don &apos;t you tell them what happened
The Paralympics , just for a little bit of clarification ,
are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities --
amputees , persons with cerebral palsy , and wheelchair athletes --
So , here we are , a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta ,
and I &apos;m just blown away by the fact that
just a year ago , I got out on a gravel track and couldn &apos;t run 50 meters .
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May ,
and was sure that I was coming home with the gold .
I was also the only , what they call &quot; bilateral BK &quot; -- below the knee .
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump .
and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says ,
&quot; How do you do that ? You know , we &apos;re supposed to have a planar foot ,
I said , &quot; Well , I just did it . No one told me that . &quot;
So , it &apos;s funny -- I &apos;m three inches within the world record --
so I &apos;m signed up in the long jump -- signed up ?
No , I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter .
I made the front page of my hometown paper
It was , like , this is my time for shine .
which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium .
These legs that I was on , which I &apos;ll take out right now --
I was the first person in the world on these legs .
this was , like -- talk about a tourist attraction .
Everyone was taking pictures -- &quot; What is this girl running on ? &quot;
And I &apos;m always looking around , like , where is my competition ?
I tried to get it out of anybody I could ,
&quot; Oh , Aimee , we &apos;ll have to get back to you on that one . &quot;
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium ,
and they post the heat sheets . And I go over and look .
And my fastest time , which was the world record , was 15.77 .
Then I &apos;m looking : the next lane , lane two , is 12.8 .
Lane three is 12.5 . Lane four is 12.2 . I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus ,
and all the women there are missing a hand .
they &apos;re all looking at me like &apos; which one of these is not like the other , &apos; you know ?
I &apos;m sitting there , like , &quot; Oh , my god . Oh , my god . &quot;
like , whether it would be the scholarship or , you know ,
I &apos;d won five golds when I skied . In everything , I came in first .
I was losing , but it was the best training because this was Atlanta .
and there is no doubt about it , that I &apos;m going to lose big .
&quot; Oh , my god , my whole family got in a van
And , you know , I was the only female U.S. sprinter .
So they call us out and , you know --
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified
because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd ,
like , the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; I know ! Look ! This isn &apos;t right . &quot;
And I &apos;m thinking that &apos;s my last card to play here ;
I &apos;m going to mess their heads a little , you know ?
I mean , it was definitely the &quot; Rocky IV &quot; sensation of me versus Germany ,
and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat .
And the gun went off , and all I remember was
fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible --
And I had to think , &quot; Why did I do this ? &quot;
If I had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
All this training -- I had transformed my life .
I became a collegiate athlete , you know . I became an Olympic athlete .
I mean , the fact that I set my sights , just a year and three months before ,
and I want to take it here for a while ,
and just seeing how far I could push it . &quot;
And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board ?
How many people gave of their time and their expertise ,
that there was , you know , 50 people behind me
that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta .
how far you &apos;ve come at this day to this goal , you know .
It &apos;s important to focus on a goal , I think , but
That &apos;s the achievement , I think . That &apos;s the real achievement .
SS : You know , show us more than one set of legs .
There are hair follicles on them , and I can paint my toenails .
to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want .
Patrick Ewing , who played for Georgetown in the &apos; 80s ,
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room
I &apos;m like , &quot; Get it off ! Don &apos;t worry about it , you know .
You can be eight feet tall . Just take them off . &quot;
He didn &apos;t find it as humorous as I did , anyway .
OK , now , these are my sprinting legs , made of carbon graphite ,
like I said , and I &apos;ve got to make sure I &apos;ve got the right socket .
These are -- do you want to hold that actually ?
That &apos;s another leg I have for , like , tennis and softball .
It has a shock absorber in it so it , like , &quot; Shhhh , &quot; makes this neat sound
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over ,
I may be a little taller . I actually can put both of them on .
SS : She can &apos;t really stand on these legs . She has to be moving , so ...
and balance is a little bit of an art in them .
But without having the silicon sock , I &apos;m just going to try slip in it .
And so , I run on these , and have shocked half the world on these .
These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run .
the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track .
as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet .
AM : It &apos;s a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot .
And I was a guinea pig , as I hope to continue to be
in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .
But actually these , like I said , are still the actual prototype .
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at , they were everywhere . You know ,
it &apos;s like a big -- it &apos;s come full circle .
Moderator : Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2,
AM : So , these are the sprint legs , and I can put my other ...
SS : Can you tell about who designed your other legs ?
AM : Yes . These I got in a place called Bournemouth , England ,
and I &apos;m the only person in the United States with these ,
which is a crime because they are so beautiful .
And I don &apos;t even mean , like , because of the toes and everything .
For me , while I &apos;m such a serious athlete on the track ,
I want to be feminine off the track , and I think it &apos;s so important
whether it &apos;s , you know , your mobility or even fashion .
I mean , I love the fact that I can go in anywhere
and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want , the skirts I want --
and I &apos;m hoping to try to bring these over here
and make them accessible to a lot of people .
This is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here .
And , I mean , it &apos;s really -- let me take this off so you can see it .
I don &apos;t know how good you can see it , but , like , it really is .
There &apos;re veins on the feet , and then my heel is pink ,
and my Achilles &apos; tendon -- that moves a little bit .
And it &apos;s really an amazing store . I got them a year and two weeks ago .
And this is just a silicon piece of skin .
if I can go to Madame Tussauds &apos; wax museum
and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes ,
that looks like a leg , or an arm , or a hand ? &quot;
SS : Two weeks ago , Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs .
And she came into town and she rushed around
and she said , &quot; I have to buy some new shoes ! &quot;
because it means I &apos;m walking like that all night long .
SS : For 45 minutes . Luckily , the hotel was terrific .
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
AM : I said to the receptionist -- I mean , I am just harried , and Sheryl &apos;s at my side --
I said , &quot; Look , do you have anybody here who could help me ?
You know , at first they were just going to write me off , like ,
&quot; If you don &apos;t like your shoes , sorry . It &apos;s too late . &quot;
&quot; No , no , no , no . I &apos;ve got these special feet
that need a two-inch heel . I have a three-inch heel .
They didn &apos;t even want to touch that one . They just did it .
I &apos;m actually going back in a couple of weeks
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet
so I can wear sneakers , because I can &apos;t with these ones .
could really bring a great deal to the debate .
that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year
So that &apos;s a chunk of what we &apos;re looking for .
And TV , satellite and cable revenues are way up .
in a market that has no historic norms --
which is quite a lot when you consider that , back in &apos; 98,
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people .
And so the job losses that came with the Internet
have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries .
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics
that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day .
And some people think that string theory is tough .
Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians &apos; toolkit .
back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages
Some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large ,
that it doesn &apos;t get compounded for inflation every year .
the world &apos;s hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs .
a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs ,
when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry
into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy .
We &apos;ve got a real problem with math education right now .
Governments realize that it &apos;s a big deal for our economies ,
and at the other end we &apos;ve got a more mathematical world ,
a more quantitative world than we ever have had .
So what &apos;s the problem , why has this chasm opened up ,
let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world
And then you get an answer that &apos;s quantitative in the modern world .
You wouldn &apos;t have expected that a few years back .
But now you can find out all about --
unfortunately , my weight is a little higher than that , but --
And in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
Why is it such an important part of education
being skeptical of government statistics , those kinds of things --
into being able to process and think logically . It &apos;s part of human society .
What do we mean when we say we &apos;re doing math ,
Well , I think it &apos;s about four steps , roughly speaking ,
What is it that we want to ask ? What is it we &apos;re trying to find out here ?
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world ,
Once you &apos;ve done that , then there &apos;s the computation step .
And of course , math is very powerful at doing that .
And then finally , turn it back to the real world .
we &apos;re spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time
and using the students to spend much more effort
on learning how to do steps one , two and four --
getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .
Now it &apos;s understandable that this has all got intertwined
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand .
We &apos;ve had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject
So I think in terms of the fact that math
But that math liberation didn &apos;t get into education yet .
It &apos;s the thing you &apos;d like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do .
It &apos;s a means to an end , not an end in itself ,
and this is not a small problem by any means .
and by the way , they didn &apos;t even have fun doing it , most of them --
and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that .
I still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
And I &apos;ll say , &quot; Hmm , not sure . &quot; I &apos;ll think about it roughly .
It &apos;s still quicker to do that and more practical .
I &apos;m not for one minute suggesting that , if people are interested in hand calculating
but I don &apos;t think that we should force the entire population
So I have this distinction between what we &apos;re making people do
and the subject that , in a sense , people might follow with their own interest
So what are the issues people bring up with this ?
Well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
So my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; basics ? &quot;
learning how to service it , or design it for that matter ?
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?
I think you need to separate the basics of what you &apos;re trying to do
A hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car
you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car
and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .
so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak ,
and also allows -- in the case of driving ,
and I believe also in the future case of maths --
It can be spread across a much larger number of people
So there &apos;s another thing that comes up with basics .
with the order in which they should use them for teaching .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this .
So I asked her one day , &quot; You know , when I was your age ,
it doesn &apos;t really matter which order you &apos;re taught with them in ,
So another one that comes up is &quot; Computers dumb math down . &quot;
This one kind of annoys me , I must say .
that the math that most people are doing in school
to problems they don &apos;t really understand , for reasons they don &apos;t get ?
And what &apos;s worse , what they &apos;re learning there isn &apos;t even practically useful anymore .
Might have been 50 years ago , but it isn &apos;t anymore .
When they &apos;re out of education , they do it on a computer .
Just to be clear , I think computers can really help with this problem ,
like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand ,
show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand .
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand
that you can also make problems harder to calculate .
You can make it a quartic equation . Make it kind of harder , calculating-wise .
They &apos;re not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
So the problem we &apos;ve really got in math education
you can understand how the basics of the system work better .
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here ,
which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important .
But there &apos;s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
If you really want to check you understand math
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that .
So to be clear , what I really am suggesting here
I can &apos;t think of any other subject where that &apos;s recently been possible .
But I think we can do both at the same time here .
in far greater quantities than they &apos;ve ever got before .
being able to play with the math , interact with it ,
We want people who can feel the math instinctively .
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum .
Traditionally it &apos;s been by how difficult it is to calculate ,
by how difficult it is to understand the concepts ,
Well , it &apos;s damn hard doing the calculations , that &apos;s the problem .
This was an example I built for my daughter .
when you increase the number of sides of a polygon
And by the way , she was also very insistent
You can see that this is a very early step
and what happens when you take things to an extreme --
and very small sides and a very large number of sides .
that we don &apos;t usually give people for many , many years after this .
And yet , that &apos;s a really important practical view of the world .
In the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams ,
it &apos;s kind of hard to get the curricula changed
And one of the reasons it &apos;s so important --
so it &apos;s very important to get computers in exams .
questions like , what &apos;s the best life insurance policy to get ? --
real questions that people have in their everyday lives .
And you see , this isn &apos;t some dumbed-down model here .
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens .
Now I &apos;m not for one minute suggesting it &apos;s the only kind of question
based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
from what we often call now the &quot; knowledge economy &quot;
to what we might call a &quot; computational knowledge economy , &quot;
where high-level math is integral to what everyone does
We can engage so many more students with this ,
and they can have a better time doing it .
And you know if you walk across a chasm ,
you end up making it worse than if you didn &apos;t start at all --
and we should leap off one side and go the other --
of course , having calculated our differential equation very carefully .
and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years .
Now I &apos;m not even sure if we should brand the subject as math ,
for us , for the students and for TED here .
how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them .
had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up .
and it &apos;s a lesson that has since , I think ,
and that is , namely , that the OS is the interface .
It &apos;s like the land and the king they &apos;re inseparable , they are one .
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .
It wasn &apos;t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines .
There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers .
have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million .
and that has become the single most salient aspect
than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago .
but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental --
Certainly we &apos;ve seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard ,
and people are starting to wake up about that .
So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ?
has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot;
that we talk to them in , that we teach them in ,
It &apos;s a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well .
They also don &apos;t understand time , but that &apos;s a matter for a separate talk .
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room .
When you use a mouse , your hand is down here on the mouse pad .
It &apos;s not even on the same plane as what you &apos;re talking about :
So here was a room in which all the walls , floors , ceilings ,
were capable , not only of display but of sensing as well .
And that means input and output are in the same space
as with real word objects in real world containers .
Has to come back out , whatever you put in .
that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well .
it tried to figure out what you might mean by that .
And if there was nothing for them to do ,
in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects ,
and the system projects down the laser beam path .
So you &apos;ve got an interface that has no interface .
You operate the world as you operate the real world ,
not that remarkable in a sense ; we didn &apos;t invent the mathematics .
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display ,
it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object ,
this is a system called Urp , for urban planners ,
in which we give architects and urban planners back
And we make the machine meet them half way .
It projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock ,
then you can control the sun &apos;s position in the sky .
And we built up a series of tools like this .
even though they don &apos;t know anything about urban planning :
To move a building , you simply reach out your hand and you move the building .
into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions .
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ?
A zoning tool connects distant structures , a building and a roadway .
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? And so forth .
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab
But Alex was preparing a little , sort of obscure , indie , arthouse film
that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,
that we were painting in the film be believable ,
that he allowed us to take on that design work
So this led full circle , in a strange way ,
So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images .
And it &apos;s fun to fly through Mr. Beckett &apos;s eye .
Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images .
You have to be able to navigate in 3D .
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place
And the part that isn &apos;t spatial can often be spatialized
to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it .
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .
So we can throw it out like that . Let &apos;s reset it .
And then if it &apos;s time for analysis , we can pull back a little bit
So that &apos;s a different way to look at stuff .
then you might want , actually , to look at this
the idea that we &apos;re tracking hands in real space
not in 2D , not in fake 2D , but in actual 3D .
because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass .
So , from there to the world of real work .
a small piece of one that we &apos;re currently building .
And one thing that &apos;s very important is to combine traditional tabular data
And we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
In the real world , we have people who collaborate ;
And we might want to look at these various images .
so I can pull this from there to there .
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble .
Paul is the designer of this wand , and maybe its easiest
for him to come over here and tell me in person what &apos;s going on .
So let me get some of these out of the way .
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board .
Mind you , it &apos;s a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise ,
but we do it in the lab all the time .
needs to be undertaken in the context of space .
And finally , I &apos;d like to leave you with a glimpse
that takes us back to the world of imagery .
and put him down on the table as well .
don &apos;t go well together , and the system knows that .
And he wasn &apos;t talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 &#91; dollars &#93; ,
or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks
he was talking about the circumstances of its creation
And I think that it &apos;s time that we asked
and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task
So I will leave you with that . Thank you .
Chris Anderson : So to ask the obvious question --
CA : When real ? When for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ?
Can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?
JU : No , it has to be for every human being .
Can there really be only one interface ? There can &apos;t .
CA : But does that mean that , at your desk or in your home ,
JU : No , this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display .
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
JU : I think in five years time when you buy a computer ,
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used .
What do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ?
JU : That &apos;s a good question , and we ask ourselves that every day .
and these systems are deployed out in the real world --
do all the big data intensive , data heavy problems with it .
those are the topics right now , but that &apos;s not a killer app .
I thought I &apos;d tell you a little about what I like to write .
And I like to immerse myself in my topics .
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .
And I see my life as a series of experiments .
So , I work for Esquire magazine , and a couple of years ago ,
where I hired a team of people in Bangalore , India ,
They argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories .
because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies .
More recently , I wrote an article for Esquire called --
except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
And , more than that , whatever is on your brain
So , I decided I would try this for a month .
My most recent book -- my previous book was called &quot; The Know-It-All , &quot;
and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica
from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world ,
or more precisely from Aak , which is a type of East Asian music ,
all the way to Zwyiec , which is -- well , I don &apos;t want to ruin the ending .
It &apos;s a very exciting twist ending , like an O. Henry novel , so I won &apos;t ruin it .
because that was an experiment about how much information
Although , listening to Kevin Kelly , you don &apos;t have to remember anything .
is my most recent experiment , where I spent a year
trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible ,
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all .
As I say in my book , I &apos;m Jewish in the same way
I do think it &apos;s the defining issue of our time ,
And I have a son . I want to know what to teach him .
So , I decided to dive in head first , and try to live the Bible .
they take the Bible literally , which is , according to some polls ,
as high as 45 or 50 percent of America .
So I decided , what if you really did take the Bible literally ?
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible ,
where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as , &quot; The Lord is all that , &quot;
as opposed to what I knew it as , &quot; The Lord is my shepherd . &quot;
Then I went down and I read several versions ,
and I wrote down every single law that I could find .
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules .
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --
The Ten Commandments , love your neighbor , be fruitful and multiply .
of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible .
so I decided to let the whole thing grow ,
and this is what I looked like by the end .
As you can imagine , I spent a lot of time at airport security .
My wife wouldn &apos;t kiss me for the last two months .
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers ,
so I thought , &quot; Sounds strange , but I &apos;ll try it . &quot;
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight ,
and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man ,
by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby ,
So -- oh , there &apos;s another shot of my beard .
because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging .
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day .
You know , I could spend a year not killing ,
but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying --
you know , I live in New York , and I work as a journalist ,
so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day I had to do it .
But it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress ,
This was one of the huge lessons of the year ,
is that I almost pretended to be a better person ,
and I became a little bit of a better person .
So I had always thought , you know , &quot; You change your mind ,
and you change your behavior , &quot; but it &apos;s often the other way around .
You change your behavior , and you change your mind .
So , you know , if you want to become more compassionate ,
you know , cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing .
In the Proverbs , it says that if you smile , you will become happier ,
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey
was the rules that will get you into a little trouble
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers .
It happened -- I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing ,
you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .
And this man came up to me and he said ,
and he said , &quot; Well , I am an adulterer , are you going to stone me ? &quot;
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket
hoping for just this interaction -- and , you know , they were pebbles --
He was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know .
But he &apos;s still an adulterer , and still quite angry .
and threw them at my face , and I felt that I could --
eye for an eye -- I could retaliate , and throw one back at him .
So that was my experience stoning , and it did allow me
to talk about , in a more serious way , these big issues .
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places ,
Should we view it , you know , as original intent ,
like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible ?
I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me
of the Wikipedia , because it has all of these authors and editors
It &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
So I thought I would end by telling you
just a couple of the take-aways , the bigger lessons
The first is , thou shalt not take the Bible literally .
Because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person ,
Well , that &apos;s another . I did spend some time shepherding .
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women
during certain times of the month , and more than that ,
you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
so she sat in every seat in our apartment ,
and I had to spend much of the year standing
until I bought my own seat and carried it around .
And it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all .
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist .
that they distort all the data to fit their model .
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .
And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous .
there &apos;s , you can see a movie of the flood ,
that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes .
So , whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it &apos;s crazy --
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying ,
giving these prayers of thanksgiving , which was odd for an agnostic .
But I was saying thanks all the time , every day ,
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things
that go right every day , that I didn &apos;t even notice ,
that I took for granted , as opposed to focusing
So , this is actually a key to happiness for me ,
is to just remember when I came over here ,
the car didn &apos;t flip over , and I didn &apos;t trip coming up the stairs .
This one was unexpected because I started the year
as an agnostic , and by the end of the year ,
I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which I love .
And I &apos;m trying to start it as a movement .
the basic idea is , whether or not there is a God ,
there &apos;s something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness ,
This was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sabbath ,
because I am a workaholic , so having this one day
where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
So , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a God .
I spent a lot of time with various religious communities
throughout America because I wanted it to be more
I wanted it to be about religion in America .
So , I spent time with evangelical Christians , and Hasidic Jews , and the Amish .
After three and a half hours , he looked at his watch ,
because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance ,
that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
There &apos;s a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians ,
and they focus on the red words in the Bible ,
That &apos;s how they printed them in the old Bibles .
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality .
and you open it up , and there &apos;s nothing in it .
So , they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts ,
and I was shocked learning how much of my life
Because I learned that -- I was thinking , I was
separating my wool and linen , and I would ask these religious people
&quot; Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this ? Why would God care ? &quot;
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
If a guy from Mars came down and saw , here &apos;s one guy
blowing out the fire on top of a cake
versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics ,
would the Martians say , &apos; Well , that guy , he makes sense ,
So no , I think that rituals are , by nature , irrational .
So the key is to choose the right rituals ,
the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
You have to pick and choose . And anyone who follows the Bible
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .
and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way ,
I &apos;ve also had some meals that make me want to dry heave .
So , it &apos;s about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion ,
as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin ,
which are very much in the Bible as well .
So if we are to find any meaning in this book ,
then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
And I thought I &apos;d end with just a couple more .
so I had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day .
So , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak .
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi , Ory Okolloh --
who some of you may know from her TEDTalk --
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence ,
to being a critical part of the media landscape
and Okolloh would collate them . She would post them .
If only there was a way to automate this . &quot;
held their hands up and said , &quot; We could do that , &quot;
is a very simple way of taking reports from the field ,
That &apos;s all it is , but that &apos;s all that &apos;s needed
because what it does is it takes the tacit information
but no one person knows what everyone knows --
and it maps it and it makes it public .
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough
decided they were going to make it open source
It &apos;s been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup .
you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi
The first , obviously , is the world &apos;s free time and talents .
Now , that free time existed in the 20th century ,
but we didn &apos;t get Ushahidi in the 20th century .
But now that we &apos;ve been given media tools --
the Internet , mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume ,
what we &apos;re seeing is that people weren &apos;t couch potatoes
But it turns out we also like to create ,
We &apos;re also getting , of course , a lot of LOLcats .
part of the abundant media landscape we &apos;re getting now .
we see coming out of that , along with Ushahidi .
Now I want to stipulate , as the lawyers say ,
has tried something , has put something forward in public .
And once they &apos;ve done it , they can do it again ,
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work ,
and as anybody who &apos;s worked as an artist or a creator knows ,
Now it &apos;s tempting to want to get the Ushahidis
to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff .
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era
how much we do things because we like to do them
rather than because our boss told us to do them ,
who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade ,
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior :
If you want somebody to do less of something ,
add a punishment and they &apos;ll do less of it .
would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .
Meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands --
want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is ,
these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups .
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line ,
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late ,
we &apos;re going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill .
until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average ,
and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks --
and then they say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s it . All done ; fine . &quot;
the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers --
and when you &apos;re relying on the social part of the bargain ,
that people like to create and we want to share .
This is good . I like LOLcats as much as the next guy ,
but to make life better for everyone in the society
It really is going to be a side effect
The number of people who are going to be able
than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century .
We can use it to crack each other up , and we &apos;re going to do that .
And to the degree we &apos;re going to do that , to the degree we &apos;re able to do that ,
and I thought that , since I was among friends here ,
and try to look back and try to understand
that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide ,
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing
like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to ,
And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve
it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
I would be able to get in a taxi cab
where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is ,
Either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this ,
so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now
in a transition from the way the world used to be
And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself ,
is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
What &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
So in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense
what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff
Because I think the only way to understand this
and take a long time scale look at things .
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on
if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
the Earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock
with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand
but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it ,
with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense ,
But now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now ,
And so every drop was a little bit different .
In fact , the drops that were different in a way
grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
a form of writing that let them write down what they were ,
so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
The amazing thing is that that way of writing
since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I did
is we can now write things in this code .
And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder ,
which I try not to let the security people see at airports .
what I did is I took this code --
the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --
and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card ,
I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information ,
so that they began to get communities of cells .
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin ,
and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information
and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin ,
that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ;
which means that if a community was very successful ,
and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life
so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place
that did nothing but process information within the community .
And in fact , they began to get specialists in the community
And that was the brains and the nervous system
learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit
because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism ,
whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures ,
by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
the fact that they built these special information structures ,
the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head
where he sort of did a little bit of evolution
So now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again .
So the first steps of the story that I told you about
Then the next steps , like language and so on ,
and becoming , I guess , autocatalytic is the word for it --
And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do ,
much farther and faster than we could ever do .
And in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions ,
and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot;
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
of those random sequences that did the best job .
And let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination
and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs
of the programs that did a little bit better job .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
At the end of that , I end up with programs
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient
than programs I could have ever written by hand .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do the job
of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
In fact , their life depended on doing the job .
and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this .
It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts
In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well
to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
and that &apos;s why I think it seems so confusing .
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time
and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and I think I will stop at that point ,
just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s --
And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want :
And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years
when you played on till the game got over .
to catch the ship that left on the 17th ,
because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
And one of the English batsmen said , &quot; You know what ?
Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot;
There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days ,
so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained ,
so they all sat around making friends with each other .
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket :
because we had about the same pace of life .
The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was
that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket ,
which was , all you needed was a plank of wood
and a rubber ball , and any number of people
you could play it in a little alley --
you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ;
don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --
that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land ,
even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on ,
accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game ,
and got very excited about the possibilities in India ,
and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real , one scripted .
The scripted one is what you see in the movies ,
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me ,
Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it
And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . &quot;
And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
and said , &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot;
Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .
We got to the final , and then this moment ,
But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni
got it right in the air , but Misbah-ul-Haq , what a player .
Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .
The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman
If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go ,
it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
It was at a time when investment was coming in ,
India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride
they let the world become very good at it .
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine ,
It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country --
the only two areas in which India was very proud about
One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
were people who were taking their cues from the West .
America is a home of leagues . And they said ,
&quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India . &quot;
Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
It was never promoted , it was never sold -- it was organized .
And look what they did with our beautiful , nice ,
This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar .
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India
And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes .
And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years ,
and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises
that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities ,
but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
So , just to give you an example of how they did it --
Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot;
But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality ,
Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot --
if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example ,
This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world ,
as long as you get the best product at the best price .
And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality
that you can source the best product for the best price
So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago ,
overnight . And when he had to go back to represent
the West Indies , they asked him , &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot;
We said , &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ;
it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot;
And so he said , &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot;
And they said , &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot;
So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal ,
second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
Never would India have thought on this scale before .
Never would India have said , &quot; I want a player to play
one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet
to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica
&quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket ,
which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
And they came together because people in the movies
And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team --
as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well ,
So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look --
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd .
Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up
for Kolkata -- not for India , but for Kolkata .
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ?
&quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
How do you fix a price for a player ?
HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --
but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
The best Indian players who played every test match --
every one of the internationals , the top of the line players --
standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said ,
&quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard ,
And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today .
and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa ,
and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
Because no country works as slowly as we do
and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem ,
We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India ,
which is a pity , but in India every other sport
which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
For a long time , India was this country of poverty ,
Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
&quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view
There &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished ,
everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
an English game that India usurped a little bit ,
but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
If you want to take the game around the world ,
it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end ,
or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger
and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
We all make decisions every day ; we want to know
what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial
to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .
And surely , if somebody could really tell us how to do
It turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 1738
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is ,
and I also want to explain to you why it is
that it hasn &apos;t made a damn bit of difference .
Now , this is Bernoulli &apos;s gift . This is a direct quote .
And if it looks like Greek to you , it &apos;s because , well , it &apos;s Greek .
But the simple English translation -- much less precise ,
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this :
The expected value of any of our actions --
that is , the goodness that we can count on getting --
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something ,
if we can estimate and multiply these two things ,
we will always know precisely how we should behave .
Now , this simple equation , even for those of you
who don &apos;t like equations , is something that you &apos;re quite used to .
Here &apos;s an example : if I were to tell you , let &apos;s play
a little coin toss game , and I &apos;m going to flip a coin ,
and if it comes up heads , I &apos;m going to pay you 10 dollars ,
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me ,
most of you would say , sure , I &apos;ll take that bet . Because you know
that the odds of you winning are one half , the gain if you do is 10 dollars ,
than I &apos;m charging you to play . So , the answer is , yes .
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .
Now , the idea is simple when we &apos;re applying it to coin tosses ,
but in fact , it &apos;s not very simple in everyday life .
People are horrible at estimating both of these things ,
and that &apos;s what I want to talk to you about today .
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide
what the right thing is to do , and those are
errors in estimating the odds that they &apos;re going to succeed ,
and errors in estimating the value of their own success .
Now , let me talk about the first one first .
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy :
there are six sides to a die , two sides to a coin , 52 cards in a deck .
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades
But as it turns out , this is not a very easy idea to apply
in everyday life . That &apos;s why Americans spend more --
The reason is , this isn &apos;t how people do odds .
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs .
Now , the question I &apos;m going to put to you is whether you think
And of course , you all know that the answer is dogs .
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is
not so easy to remember pigs . And each one of you assumed
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind ,
That &apos;s not a bad rule of thumb , except when it is .
with R in the third place or R in the first place ?
Well , you check memory very briefly , make a quick scan ,
and very hard to say to yourself , Pare , Park : they come more slowly .
But in fact , there are many more words in the English language
with R in the third than the first place .
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind
It &apos;s because the mind recalls words by their first letter .
You kind of shout out the sound , S -- and the word comes .
it &apos;s hard to look things up by the third letter .
So , this is an example of how this idea that
can give you a sense of their probability --
how this idea could lead you astray . It &apos;s not just puzzles , though .
For example , when Americans are asked to estimate the odds
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --
these are estimates of number of deaths per year
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked
to guess how many people die from tornado , fireworks , asthma , drowning , etc .
Now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all ,
two things are vastly over-estimated , namely tornadoes and fireworks .
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper
It &apos;s very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances
who &apos;s blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July .
They don &apos;t come quickly to mind , and as a result ,
Indeed , this is kind of like the Sesame Street game
of &quot; Which thing doesn &apos;t belong ? &quot; And you &apos;re right to say
it &apos;s the swimming pool that doesn &apos;t belong , because the swimming pool
is the only thing on this slide that &apos;s actually very dangerous .
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination
of all three of the others that you see on the slide .
The lottery is an excellent example , of course -- an excellent test-case
And economists -- forgive me , for those of you who play the lottery --
but economists , at least among themselves , refer to the lottery
as a stupidity tax , because the odds of getting any payoff
directly down the toilet -- which , by the way ,
doesn &apos;t require that you actually go to the store and buy anything .
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
Well , there are many answers , but one answer surely is ,
we see a lot of winners . Right ? When this couple wins the lottery ,
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --
how the hell do you cash things that size , I don &apos;t know .
We see this on TV ; we read about it in the paper .
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews
every time they interview a winner , the 100 million losers
of your undivided attention just to watch them say ,
Now , if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --
no sleep , no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss ,
and then at the end there &apos;s 30 seconds of , &quot; and I won , &quot;
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small .
Look , I can prove this to you : here &apos;s a little lottery .
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and , if you win ,
you get 20 bucks . Is this a good bet ?
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars ;
this is a lottery in which you should invest your money .
Do you want it ? Most people won &apos;t play this lottery .
Now , you can see the odds of winning haven &apos;t changed ,
but it &apos;s now fantastically easy to imagine who &apos;s going to win .
It &apos;s easy to see Leroy getting the check , right ?
You can &apos;t say to yourself , &quot; I &apos;m as likely to win as anybody , &quot;
because you &apos;re not as likely to win as Leroy .
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy
even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds .
Now , estimating odds , as difficult as it may seem , is a piece of cake
trying to say what something is worth , how much we &apos;ll enjoy it ,
I want to talk now about errors in value .
How much is this Big Mac worth ? Is it worth 25 dollars ?
Most of you have the intuition that it &apos;s not --
But in fact , to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires
that you ask one , and only one question , which is :
If you &apos;ve ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia
and realized that they &apos;re not going to serve you any food ,
but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened
the McDonald &apos;s bag , and the smell of golden arches
I can &apos;t do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours .
I can &apos;t even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter !
Suddenly , 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal .
On the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country ,
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s exorbitant for a Big Mac .
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no ,
before I &apos;d even told you anything about the context ?
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac
to the price you &apos;re used to paying . Rather than asking ,
&quot; What else can I do with my money , &quot; comparing this investment
to other possible investments , you compared to the past .
What you knew is , you paid three dollars in the past ; 25 is outrageous .
This is an error , and I can prove it to you by showing
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal .
When people are asked about these two different jobs :
a job where you make 60K , then 50K , then 40K ,
a job where you &apos;re getting a salary cut each year ,
and one in which you &apos;re getting a salary increase ,
people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact
they &apos;re all told they make much less money . Why ?
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse
than rising wages , even when the total amount of wages is higher
Here &apos;s a $ 2,000 Hawaiian vacation package ; it &apos;s now on sale for 1,600 .
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii , would you buy this package ?
Most people say they would . Here &apos;s a slightly different story :
$ 2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars ,
so you decide to mull it over for a week .
By the time you get to the ticket agency , the best fares are gone --
the package now costs 1,500 . Would you buy it ? Most people say , no .
Why ? Because it used to cost 700 , and there &apos;s no way I &apos;m paying 1,500
is causing people to pass up the better deal . In other words ,
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .
Here &apos;s another example of how comparing to the past
In your wallet you have a ticket , for which you paid 20 dollars .
you discover that somewhere along the way you &apos;ve lost the ticket .
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ?
Now , let &apos;s just change one thing in this scenario .
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills .
When you arrive you discover you &apos;ve lost one of them .
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
Well , of course , I went to the theater to see the play .
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do ?
In both cases , it was a piece of paper .
In one case , it had a U.S. president on it ; in the other case it didn &apos;t .
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself ,
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it &apos;s a bad deal .
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems
But even when we compare with the possible , instead of the past ,
And I &apos;m going to show you one or two of them .
that when we compare one thing to the other , it changes its value .
So in 1992 , this fellow , George Bush , for those of us who were
kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum ,
Now , retailers knew this long before anybody else did , of course ,
and they use this wisdom to help you --
And so a retailer , if you were to go into a wine shop
and you had to buy a bottle of wine ,
and you see them here for eight , 27 and 33 dollars , what would you do ?
So , they will opt for the item in the middle .
If you &apos;re a smart retailer , then , you will put a very expensive item
because suddenly the $ 33 wine doesn &apos;t look as expensive in comparison .
the problem is that when you get that $ 33 bottle of wine home ,
it won &apos;t matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to .
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value ,
where we &apos;re trying to estimate how much we &apos;ll like things ,
are not the same comparisons we &apos;ll be making when we consume them .
I have to show you something from my own lab , so let me sneak this in .
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?
They &apos;re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
For some of the subjects , sitting in the far corner of a room
is a box of Godiva chocolates , and for others is a can of Spam .
In fact , these items that are sitting in the room change
how much the subjects think they &apos;re going to enjoy the potato chips .
think potato chips are going to be quite tasty ;
Of course , what happens when they eat the potato chips ?
Well , look , you didn &apos;t need a psychologist to tell you that
when you have a mouthful of greasy , salty , crispy , delicious snacks ,
makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience .
that then does not carry through and change their experience .
You &apos;ve all experienced this yourself , even if you &apos;ve never come
into our lab to eat potato chips . So here &apos;s a question :
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars ,
but if you drive across town , you can get it for 100 bucks .
So would you drive to get 50 percent off , saving 100 dollars ?
They can &apos;t imagine buying it for twice the price
when , with one trip across town , they can get it for half off .
Now , let &apos;s imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo ,
and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000 .
But if you drove across town , you could get it for 30,900 .
Would you drive to get it ? At this point , 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars .
Most people say , no , I &apos;m going to schlep across town
to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car ?
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should .
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello ! --
When you go to buy groceries with it , it doesn &apos;t go ,
I &apos;m the money saved on the car stereo , or ,
I &apos;m the dumb money saved on the car . It &apos;s money .
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks
no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . People don &apos;t think that way .
That &apos;s why they don &apos;t know whether their mutual fund manager
is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment ,
but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .
Now , you can see , this is the problem of shifting comparisons ,
because what you &apos;re doing is , you &apos;re comparing the 100 bucks
but when you go to spend that money you won &apos;t be making that comparison .
If you &apos;re an American , for example , you &apos;ve probably traveled in France .
And at some point you may have met a couple
&quot; Oh , my God , these people are so warm . They &apos;re so nice to me .
I mean , compared to all these people who hate me
when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don &apos;t ,
these people are just wonderful . &quot; And so you tour France with them ,
and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner ,
they are boring and dull , right ? Because in this new context ,
the comparison is very , very different . In fact , you find yourself
disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship .
Now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo .
You go to the stereo store , you see two sets of speakers --
these big , boxy , monoliths , and these little , sleek speakers ,
and you play them , and you go , you know , I do hear a difference :
And so you buy them , and you bring them home ,
and you entirely violate the d鑼卌or of your house .
And the problem , of course , is that this comparison you made in the store
What are the odds that years later you &apos;ll turn on the stereo and go ,
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult
about things that will happen at different points in time .
is that by and large people use two simple rules .
So let me give you one very easy problem , a second very easy problem
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now . Which would you prefer ?
This is what we call a one-item IQ test , OK ?
All of us , I hope , prefer more money , and the reason is ,
You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month . Which would you prefer ?
because we all know that now is better than later .
What &apos;s hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict .
For example , when you &apos;re offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month .
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain
What do we know ? What do people do in these kinds of situations ?
That is , they require interest rates in the hundred
or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification
and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
Maybe that isn &apos;t so remarkable , but what is remarkable is
how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing
when the delivery of these monetary units will happen .
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that &apos;s 12 months --
People are gladly willing to wait : as long as they &apos;re waiting 12,
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested
you would show if I gave you time to respond , which is ,
people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher
than the subjective value of 60 when they &apos;ll be delivered in now
or one month , respectively -- a 30-day delay --
but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision
Now , why in the world do you get this pattern of results ?
one of them larger than the other : the fireman and the fiddler .
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon ,
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . No point .
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .
First it &apos;s an inch in your view , then it &apos;s a quarter-inch ,
then a half-inch , and then finally they go off the edge of the earth .
Here are the results of what I just showed you .
the height you saw of these guys at various points .
And I want you to see that two things are true .
One , the farther away they are , the smaller they look ;
and two , the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler .
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear . Right .
At a very close distance , the fiddler looks taller than the fireman ,
As Plato said , what space is to size , time is to value .
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you :
and what you can see is , our two rules are preserved .
and they always think now is better than later :
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side .
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now
over waiting a month , but not if that decision is far in the future .
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely , that
when people get to the future , they will change their minds .
That is , as that month 12 approaches , you will say ,
what was I thinking , waiting an extra month for 60 dollars ?
Well , the question with which I &apos;d like to end is this :
If we &apos;re so damn stupid , how did we get to the moon ?
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence
of people &apos;s inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value .
The answer to this question , I think , is an answer you &apos;ve already heard
in some of the talks , and I dare say you will hear again :
namely , that our brains were evolved for a very different world
rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves ,
had rather short lives in which there were few choices
and the highest priority was to eat and mate today .
Bernoulli &apos;s gift , Bernoulli &apos;s little formula , allows us , it tells us
how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us .
That explains why we are so bad at using it , but it also explains
why it is so terribly important that we become good , fast .
that has ever held its own fate in its hands .
the things that normally cause species to become extinct
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us
If we &apos;re not here in 10,000 years , it &apos;s going to be because
we could not take advantage of the gift given to us
because we underestimated the odds of our future pains
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert . One and two .
is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us ,
and is there some way that we could counteract that ?
with the Department of Homeland Security , which generally believes
that American security dollars should go to making borders safer .
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name
based on people &apos;s psychological reaction to a set of events ,
and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask
what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified ,
rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --
and forgive me , but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents .
We already know , for example , in the United States ,
more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --
because they were scared -- and driving on highways ,
If I told you that there was a plague
that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year ,
you might be alarmed if you didn &apos;t find out it was the flu .
These are small-scale accidents , and we should be wondering
and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us .
CA : Dan , I &apos;d like to hear more on this . So , you &apos;re saying
that our response to terror is , I mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bug ?
That &apos;s an awful large lot of very nice people . On the other hand ,
when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed ,
by not using their seatbelts in the same country .
CA : What causes the bug ? Is it the drama of the event --
Is it the fact that it &apos;s an intentional attack by , quote , outsiders ?
DG : Yes . It &apos;s a number of things , and you hit on several of them .
First , it &apos;s a human agent trying to kill us --
it &apos;s not a tree falling on us by accident .
Second , these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again .
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --
as if there &apos;s good reason , but sometimes people think there are .
So there are a number of things that together
make this seem like a fantastic event , but let &apos;s not play down
the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it
they want to read . So there &apos;s a large role here played by the media ,
CA : I mean , what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ?
and then everybody &apos;s unhappy about it , and an hour-and-a-half later --
at least when I was there , and I was 150 feet from the mall
when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel
and the wedding that was planned was still going on .
she said , &quot; We never let them win by stopping weddings . &quot;
I mean , this is a society that has learned --
and there are others too -- that has learned to live
with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it ,
shall I say , as those of us who have not had many terror attacks .
CA : But is there a rational fear that actually ,
the reason we &apos;re frightened about this is because we think that
DG : Yes , of course . So , if we knew that this was the worst attack
there would ever be , there might be more and more buses of 30 people --
I don &apos;t want to say -- please , I &apos;m going to get quoted somewhere
as saying , &quot; Terrorism is fine and we shouldn &apos;t be so distressed . &quot;
should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats
I think in the case of terrorism , it isn &apos;t .
And many of the things we &apos;ve heard about from our speakers today --
how many people do you know got up and said ,
Poverty ! I can &apos;t believe what poverty is doing to us .
People get up in the morning ; they don &apos;t care about poverty .
It &apos;s not making headlines , it &apos;s not making news , it &apos;s not flashy .
I mean , if you had to solve one of these problems , Chris ,
Poverty , by an order of magnitude , a huge order of magnitude ,
terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come .
is that it &apos;s incredibly hard for them to do that .
If that turns out to be wrong , we all look silly ,
DG : Even if that were true , still more people die from poverty .
about these dramatic attacks . Is that because in the past ,
in the ancient past , we just didn &apos;t understand things like disease
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy
But if you got attacked , that was something you could do something about .
DG : Well , you know , the people who are most skeptical
My guess is that there &apos;s nothing quite that specific
in our evolutionary past . But rather , if you &apos;re looking for
that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is , they &apos;re a little scared
Any animal you see that you &apos;ve seen before is less likely
to be a predator than one that you &apos;ve never seen before .
So , you know , when a school bus is blown up and we &apos;ve never seen this before ,
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s quite as specific a mechanism
as the one you alluded to , but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it .
Jay Walker : You know , economists love to talk about
the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets . But I suspect
you &apos;re making the exact same error you &apos;re accusing those people of ,
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning .
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year ,
so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose ,
and yet she buys 150 tickets a year . Why is that ?
It &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
releases serotonin in the brain , and actually provides a good feeling
Or , to put it another way , for the dollar investment ,
you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money
down the toilet , which you cannot have a good feeling from .
And as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people .
And so fundamentally , the reason we got to the moon is ,
we didn &apos;t listen to the economists . Thank you very much .
DG : Well , no , it &apos;s a great point . It remains to be seen
by the amount of disappointment after the lottery . Because remember ,
people who didn &apos;t buy tickets don &apos;t feel awful the next day either ,
even though they don &apos;t feel great during the drawing .
I would disagree that people know they &apos;re not going to win .
I think they think it &apos;s unlikely , but it could happen ,
which is why they prefer that to the flushing .
But certainly I see your point : that there can be
some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning .
Now , I think there &apos;s many good reasons not to listen to economists .
That isn &apos;t one of them , for me , but there &apos;s many others .
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --
I work on aging -- and I &apos;m interested in doing something about it ,
with getting people interested in doing anything about aging
is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer
or heart disease or whatever . Do you have any advice ?
Well , it &apos;s notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted .
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work
is to get people to imagine the future more vividly .
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future
and the near future is that we imagine the near future
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail
of near and far future , people begin to make decisions
So , would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you &apos;re 65
imagine who you &apos;ll be when you &apos;re 65 : will you be living ,
what will you look like , how much hair will you have ,
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario ,
suddenly we feel like it might be important to save
so that that guy has a little retirement money .
I think in general you &apos;re battling a very fundamental human tendency ,
The book starts like this . This is the cover .
Or , we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .
And if we wanted to zoom into a page ,
you just fold it back up and put it back on the page .
And so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
This photo , you can you can even see on an interactive map .
Zoom into it and see where it was taken .
AG : Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
And while it &apos;s playing , we can pinch and peak back at the page ,
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents ,
But one of the coolest things in this book
any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --
And this whole book , it doesn &apos;t just run on the iPad .
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room
and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone .
that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content .
So Melcher Media &apos;s team , who &apos;s on the East coast --
and we &apos;re on the West coast , building the software --
CA : So you want to license this software to publishers
This is very strange for me , because I &apos;m not used to doing this :
I usually stand on the other side of the light ,
and now I &apos;m feeling the pressure I put other people into . And it &apos;s hard ...
the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss ,
and trying to find the answer to the big questions .
But this , for me , I mean , coming here to do this ,
feels like -- there &apos;s this sculptor that I like very much , Giacometti ,
who after many years of living in France -- and learning , you know ,
studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked , what did you produce ?
What have you done with so many years of being away ?
And he sort of , he showed a handful of figurines .
And obviously they were , &quot; Is this what you spent years doing ?
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces
was the culmination of a man &apos;s life , search , thought , everything --
I feel like I &apos;m coming home to talk about
And I will start with a brief taster of what I閳ユ獫e been about :
two feature films and a handful of short films .
Court : I don &apos;t want to get rid of you .
And how come you ain &apos;t got a job anyway ?
Marcus : So I &apos;ve done my bit for Queen and country , now I work for myself .
Boy : No , now you sit around like a bum all day .
Boy : Arguing with you is a waste of time , Marcus .
Boy : Racism , oppression , people like me not getting a break in life .
Marcus : So what solutions do you offer ? I mean , the job of a poet is not just --
Boy : Man , fight the power ! Simple : blow the motherfuckers out of the sky .
Boy : Man , if I had one , too fuckin &apos; right .
Marcus : And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you ?
it &apos;s a sure sign of his inability to express himself .
Boy : See man , you閳ユ獧e just taking the piss out of me now .
Ass kickin &apos; guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist , powers-that-be bullshit ,
and just went in there and kicked everybody &apos;s arse .
D1 : Not to make a bad joke , but it was really 鑼卲uis鑼 ?
Now , you talk straight to me , what &apos;s wrong with my films ?
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees .
Did you ever move your fuckin &apos; ass from Hollywood
Newton Aduaka : Thank you . The first clip , really , is
totally trying to capture what cinema is for me ,
and where I &apos;m coming from in terms of cinema .
The first piece was , really , there &apos;s a young woman talking about Nigeria ,
that she has a feeling she &apos;ll be happy there .
These are the sentiments of someone that &apos;s been away from home .
And that was something that I went through , you know , and I &apos;m still going through .
I &apos;ve not been home for quite a while , for about five years now .
it &apos;s really how suddenly , you know , this was made in 1997,
which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship ,
the worst part of Nigerian history , this post-colonial history .
is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is .
How -- and it &apos;s sort of , perhaps romantic , but I think beautiful ,
because you just need something to hold on to ,
Which takes us to the next piece , where the young man
talks about lack of opportunity : living as a black person in Europe ,
the glass ceiling that we all know about , that we all talk about ,
Again , this was my -- this was me talking about --
this was , again , the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom ,
and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say ,
what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people ?
what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think ,
I mean , with all this anger that &apos;s built up inside of him ?
which we see when we talk about the ghettos
and we talk about , you know , South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff ,
you know , evolves and manifests itself as riots --
like the one in France two years ago , where I live ,
I &apos;ve lived in France for about four , and I feel actually
And then , the third piece . The third piece for me is the question :
What is cinema to you ? What do you do with cinema ?
There &apos;s a young director , Hollywood director , with his friends --
I suppose that will take me to my last piece --
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,
a few months before the Biafran , which lasted for three years
that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .
Commander : Soldiers , you are going to fight a battle ,
so you must get ready and willing to die .
C : Success , the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun .
C : This is an AK-47 rifle . This is your life .
This is your life . This is ... this is ... this is your life .
Ezra : They give us the special drugs . We call it bubbles .
Soldiers : Rain come , sun come , soldier man dey go .
I say rain come , sun come , soldier man dey go .
We went from one village to another -- three villages .
He knows we did not know . We did not know !
Various Voices : ? We don &apos;t need no more trouble ?
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward .
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket .
You are planning to go back to fight are you ?
Committee Chairman : We hope that , with your help and the help of others , that this commission
will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war .
More than that , begin a healing process and finally to --
as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country &apos;s history .
Ask my sister , she is the witch , she knows everything .
CC : Mr. Gelehun , I閳ユ獓 like to remind you you閳ユ獧e not on trial here
then you have to charge every soldier in the world .
War is a crime , yes , but I did not start it .
Lack of education was their way to control power .
If I may ask , do you pay for school in your country ?
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before ?
CC : Mr. Gelehun , I &apos;d like to remind you , you &apos;re not on trial here today .
NA : Thank you . Just very quickly to say that my point really here ,
is that while we閳ユ獧e making all these huge advancements ,
what we &apos;re doing , which for me , you know , I think we should --
One of the themes that comes through very strongly
in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young
that have to play this role of being child soldiers .
and when we consider the extent to which it &apos;s not taken as seriously
as it should be , what would you have to say about that ?
NA : In the process of my research , I actually spent
a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this .
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers --
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip ,
I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself ,
if any kid in the West , in the western world ,
went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through ,
they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives .
So for me , the thought that we have all these children --
it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children --
who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage ,
EO : Well , we thank you again for coming to the TED stage .
Frank Gehry : I listened to this scientist this morning .
and I realized that I almost became a scientist .
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set
So , I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator ,
and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker
And the glass -- luckily I turned around --
FG : People on the street came and knocked on the door
The gentleman to my left is the very famous , perhaps overly famous ,
And Frank , you &apos;ve come to a place in your life , which is astonishing .
I mean it is astonishing for an artist , for an architect ,
to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .
I mean you have become , whether you can giggle at it
because it &apos;s a funny ... you know , it &apos;s a strange thought ,
you can draw a little picture of that building , it can be used in ads --
and you &apos;ve had not rock star status , but celebrity status
in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life .
And it didn &apos;t seem , at least , that your sell outs ,
You kept moving ahead in a life where you &apos;re dependent
But that &apos;s an interesting thing for a creative person .
And that &apos;s one of the great dilemmas -- we &apos;re in a creativity session --
how to do work that &apos;s big enough and not sell out .
and that makes your win doubly big , triply big .
It &apos;s not quite a question but you can comment on it .
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head .
and that you had to please the clients and stuff .
And I realized when I &apos;d come into the meetings
That was my response to the people in the time .
And actually , it was responding to clients that I had
who didn &apos;t have very much money , so they couldn &apos;t afford very much .
Until I got to my house , where the client was my wife .
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica
and for like 50 grand I built a house around it .
And it was late in the evening . We &apos;d had a lot to drink .
We were standing out in the desert all alone and ,
&quot; Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent ,
somewhere in 2000 years somebody &apos;s going to like it ? &quot;
So , I thought , &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s probably a good idea . &quot;
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money ,
But I just found out the world ain &apos;t going to last that long ,
I don &apos;t see it the way you characterized it .
I go in and start working , I &apos;m not sure where I &apos;m going --
if I knew where I was going , I wouldn &apos;t do it .
When I can predict or plan it , I don &apos;t do it .
Obviously , over time I have a lot more confidence
I do run a kind of a business --
but the actual work on the project is with ,
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him :
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it ,
I felt an embarrassment -- &quot; How could I have done that ?
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that ? &quot;
It &apos;s taken several years to now look at it detached and say --
as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road
and the street , and it appears to have a relationship --
RSW : What &apos;s the status of the New York project ?
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me ,
I didn &apos;t think he knew what he was doing ,
So , I think he &apos;s Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy .
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up .
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero
RSW : How much further along is it than that ,
FG : That will be finished in 2003 -- September , October --
and I &apos;m hoping Kyu , and Herbie , and Yo-Yo and all those guys
Luckily , today most of the people I &apos;m working with are people I really like .
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons
He &apos;s been a cheerleader for quite a long time .
There aren &apos;t many people around that are really involved
And so to find one , a guy like that ,
and it &apos;s hard to add to a building like that --
and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect
and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture .
and his early work had a resemblance to my early work .
I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California ,
and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs
I tried to understand that language as a beginning ,
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders
and it was trivialized so much that it wasn &apos;t ...
I mean , Charlie Moore did a bunch of it ,
and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn &apos;t pan out .
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that
I &apos;ve done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra ,
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --
Where you ... It &apos;s like jazz : you improvise , you work together ,
for me , it &apos;s a way of trying to understand the city
RSW : Is it going to be near the current campus ?
Or is it going to be down near ...
You can come to the opening . I &apos;ll invite you .
No , but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment ,
and if you can figure out how to work off each other --
who respect each other &apos;s work and play off each other ,
how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect .
I &apos;d seen drawings you had presented here at TED .
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city .
That was the surprise of going across the river ,
you get up and you talk about your work ,
and it &apos;s almost like you tell everybody you &apos;re a good guy
And it &apos;s like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow .
I mean that should be a matter of fact , like gravity .
If you don &apos;t meet the budgets , you &apos;re not going to get much work .
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT
They were there three days and it rained every day
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden , you know ?
I was clean . There wasn &apos;t a bloody leak in the place ,
yeah , well up until then every building leaked , so this ...
RW : ... sort of had a fame . His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while .
FG : You &apos;ve all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story ,
So , some years later I was doing a building ,
a little house on the beach for Norton Simon ,
and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady ,
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story .
But my point is that ... and I call it the &quot; then what ? &quot;
you &apos;re a good guy , you &apos;re a good person ...
And I think that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been interested in ,
is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .
and still touch all the bases that are necessary
it &apos;s the &quot; then what &quot; that most clients who hire architects --
They &apos;re hiring them to get it done , get it on budget ,
and they &apos;re missing out on the real value of an architect .
RSW : At a certain point a number of years ago , people --
when Michael Graves was a fashion , before teapots ...
FG : I did a teapot and nobody bought it .
Is that a curse , that people want a Bilbao building ?
Since Bilbao opened , which is now four , five years ,
and they get you for at least one or two meetings .
In one case , I flew all the way to Malaga with a team
because the thing was signed with seals and various
and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .
I asked them what kind of building it was .
&quot; When you get here we &apos;ll explain it . &quot; Blah , blah , blah .
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel
and then they took us in a boat out in the water
and showed us all these sights in the harbor .
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor
It was a table as long as this carpet
We sat down , and we had a drink of water
&quot; Now what can I do for you , Mr. Gehry ? &quot;
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said ,
&quot; You mean you &apos;re not going to have lunch with the mayor ? &quot;
They just brought us there to hustle this group ,
RSW : Well , I &apos;m going to wind this up and wind up the meeting
Are you going to talk about me or you ?
FG : Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
RSW : You &apos;re going to get one ! You &apos;re going to get one !
unless you think of it in the terms that I do ,
have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies ,
if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body
I want to start by showing you a rudimentary ,
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick
that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s .
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
The knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve
I &apos;m just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
That way you can see that at no time
can anything travel , as long as I &apos;m squeezing there
So , this is a trick that I often teach to young children
that are interested in magic , because you can learn
this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick methodologically .
Probably many of you in the room know this trick .
I say I &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve ,
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you
this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift
Someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
And we could talk about why this is deceptive ,
why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here ,
because the mind , and the way it processes information ,
it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . It groups them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up .
And then when I close my finger , same thing ,
kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . You give the knife out .
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . Thanks .
what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me ,
a placebo in the form of a white pill ,
it &apos;s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect .
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in ,
and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it ,
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
Turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
A colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other
... these dosages have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind ,
It &apos;s a really , this graph , well I &apos;ll show it to you
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill
is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality ,
I wanted to see if I could take that idea
And take something that is obviously a fake trick
that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
This is a seven-inch hatpin . It &apos;s very , very sharp ,
and I &apos;m going to just sterilize it a tiny bit .
That &apos;s my skin right there . This is not a Hollywood special effect .
and run this needle through to the other side .
if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends
in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know ,
that you look away for about the next 30 --
in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
at the lower part of my arm I just make
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit ,
Now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in
But you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two
I know what people think when they see this .
to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
Let me give you good close look at this .
That really is my skin . That is not a Hollywood special effect .
That &apos;s my flesh , and I can twist that around .
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this
will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of neat
in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be --
see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wounds .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
&apos;Theme and variations &apos; is one of those forms that
with the theme that you hold in your mind .
and everything that follows is a variation on the subject .
I was asked , I guess about six years ago ,
that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca .
And it was very difficult for me to imagine
how to paint pictures that were based on Piero
until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature --
that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca
as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree .
but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations
in this case that remarkable painting that &apos;s in the Uffizi , &quot; The Duke of Montefeltro , &quot;
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject ,
It &apos;s just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro ,
which is why he is always shown in profile .
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --
so that for the first time in history , they &apos;re facing the same direction .
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero ,
as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat .
Incidentally , I &apos;ve never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism .
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with
I was driving in the country one day with my wife ,
and I said , &quot; That is a fabulous piece of design . &quot;
because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage ,
and since most people are so suspicious of garages ,
and know that they &apos;re going to be ripped off ,
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman --
which is an archaic word , nobody calls Dutch people &quot; Dutchmen &quot; anymore --
you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike ,
preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland , and so on .
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of &quot; Dutchman . &quot;
Now , if you think I &apos;m exaggerating at all in this ,
all you have to do is substitute something else , like &quot; Indonesian . &quot;
Now , &quot; Swiss &quot; works , but you know it &apos;s going to cost a lot of money .
I &apos;m going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts , where I teach ,
and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes --
often gives you a piece of text and he says , &quot; Do something with this . &quot;
And this was the text -- &quot; In words as fashion the same rule will hold /
Be not the first by whom the new are tried /
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside . &quot;
And the first thing I did , which was sort of in the absence of another idea ,
was say I &apos;ll sort of write it out and make some words big ,
and I &apos;ll have some kind of design on the back somehow ,
and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something .
and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper
and I pasted them down on an ugly board .
I thought that something would come out of it ,
like &quot; Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope &quot;
but I sort of made a mess out of it ,
and then I thought I &apos;d repeat it in some way so it was legible .
I write down things that I know about it .
But you can see the beginning of an idea there ,
because you can see the word &quot; new &quot; emerging from the &quot; old . &quot;
There &apos;s a relationship between the old and the new ;
the new emerges from the context of the old .
I had this other version which had something interesting about it
in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues .
The W was clearly a W , the N was clearly an N ,
and there wasn &apos;t a lot of information in it .
and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return .
And so , I do something I &apos;m truthfully ashamed of ,
which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose
And I was going to do a thing , I say , &quot; Well , change the copy .
Let it say something about dreams , and come to SVA
that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .
For one thing , it transgresses the idea of what a poster &apos;s supposed to be ,
which is to be understood and seen immediately , and not explained .
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --
&quot; If you have to explain it , it ain &apos;t working . &quot;
And one day I woke up and I said , &quot; Well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
So here &apos;s what it says in my explanation at the bottom left .
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
I am now exposing myself to my audience , right ?
Which is something you never want to do professionally .
&quot; Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening .
Don &apos;t be trendy if you want to be serious .
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself ?
by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old ,
And then I show you a little drawing --
you see , you remember that old thing I discarded ?
and I say , &quot; Not bad , &quot; -- criticizing myself --
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace ,
a kind of dance where each defines the other . &quot;
And then more self-questioning -- &quot; Am I being simple-minded ?
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious , or the kind that looks profound ?
Actually , I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition .
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school ? &quot;
Well , I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things .
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience ,
and not to suggest that I am confident about what I &apos;m doing .
And as you know , you have to have a front .
if you don &apos;t believe in your work , who else is going to believe in it ?
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ;
and if you don &apos;t like that , how about the little one ?
where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?
simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer ,
At times , it seems to be wider at the back than the front ,
And if you sit here long enough , it &apos;ll float off the page into the audience .
where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective ,
but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape --
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts .
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it ,
and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --
was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city &apos;s subway system
so every time you got on the subway you &apos;d be passing a different poster ,
all of which had a different idea of what art is .
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of &quot; art is &quot;
But then I gave up and I said , &quot; Well , art is whatever . &quot;
I discovered that the word &quot; hat &quot; was hidden in the word &quot; whatever , &quot;
But then again , it &apos;s on my list of didactic posters .
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster ,
I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte &apos;s everyman --
to express the idea that art is mystery , continuity and history .
I &apos;m also convinced that , in an age of computer manipulation ,
a sort of &apos; it ain &apos;t what you do , it &apos;s the way that you do it &apos; notion .
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster
a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word &apos; hat , &apos;
The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined :
as a thing itself , the worth of the thing , the shadow of the thing ,
sort of , see how far you could go and still be able to read them .
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom .
And , of course those are the remains , and they &apos;re so labeled .
But what really happens is that you read it as :
and all the ideas will start to percolate up .
I think everybody should do it -- think that you &apos;ve got three wishes .
And what would you do ? It &apos;s actually a great exercise
to really drill down to the things that you feel are important ,
And thinking that , can an individual actually do something ,
that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference ?
And I think , quite frankly , that &apos;s where I started .
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian .
We have this Great North . And there was a pretty small population ,
So I really had a chance to experience that .
And I could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me .
is that we are this transient thing that &apos;s happening ,
and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines ,
the untouched forest that I was able to see --
really bring in a sense of that geological time ,
that this has gone on for a long time ,
And that , to me , was a reference point that I think I needed to have
to be able to make the work that I did .
And I did go out , and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring ,
This rebirth of grass . And then I went out for years
that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career .
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture ,
or something of that nature , and I couldn &apos;t get away from it .
So I started to think of , how can I rethink the landscape ?
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania ,
and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .
And I ended up in a town called Frackville .
I got out of the car , and I stood up ,
and it was a coal-mining town . I did a 360 turnaround ,
and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I &apos;ve ever seen .
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this ,
and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions
And that became the baseline of what I was doing .
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto ,
that this theme was large enough to become a life &apos;s work ,
to become something that I could sink my teeth into
and just research and find out where these industries are .
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks ,
was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in .
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs --
to get into that place to make those photographs ,
and if it wasn &apos;t for those people letting me in
I would have never made this body of work .
So in that respect , to me , I &apos;m not against the corporation .
and I feel that we all need them and they &apos;re important .
So there &apos;s this thing that is pulling me in both directions .
And I &apos;m not making an indictment towards what &apos;s happening here ,
So I started thinking , well , we live in all these ages of man :
the Stone Age , and the Iron Age , and the Copper Age .
And these ages of man are still at work today .
And it &apos;s a scary thing as well . Because when we start looking
that , to me , is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate .
I &apos;m hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work ,
and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image .
Not to say , &quot; Oh my God , what is it ? &quot; but to be challenged by it --
to say , &quot; Wow , this is beautiful , &quot; on one level ,
but on the other level , &quot; This is scary . I shouldn &apos;t be enjoying it . &quot;
Like a forbidden pleasure . And it &apos;s that forbidden pleasure
and it gets people to look at these things ,
and it gets people to enter it . And it also , in a way , defines kind of what I feel , too --
I want a house , and I want a car .
And how do I begin to have that attraction , repulsion ?
It &apos;s even in my own conscience I &apos;m having it ,
and here in my work , I &apos;m trying to build that same toggle .
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here
had 45 million tires in it . It was the largest one .
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me , and it caught fire
about four years ago . It &apos;s around Westley , California , around Modesto .
And I decided to start looking at something that , to me , had --
if the earlier work of looking at the landscape
had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature ,
was starting to point to a direction . To me , it was our redemption .
That in the recycling work that I was doing ,
I &apos;m looking for a practice , a human activity that is sustainable .
That if we keep putting things , through industrial and urban existence ,
if we keep doing that -- we can continue on .
and there &apos;s many other things that are coming on stream --
to go into that landscape and tear it apart .
But in the meantime , these things are scaling up .
What you &apos;re looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh ,
so I started to move away from North America ;
came out of a radio program I was listening to .
and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned ,
And I thought , &quot; My God , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot;
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand ,
So originally I was going to go to India .
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there ,
and then I was able to get into Bangladesh ,
and saw for the first time a third world , a view of it ,
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin --
Here you &apos;re looking at some oil fields in California ,
some of the biggest oil fields . And again , I started to think that --
that the whole world I was living in was
And that , to me , was again something that I started building on ,
So this is a series I &apos;m hoping to have ready
Because I think everything that we &apos;re involved in --
our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything -- are directly a result .
I &apos;m going to move to some pictures of China .
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago ,
and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind ,
has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around .
a GM town , and my father worked at GM ,
so I was very familiar with that kind of industry
and that also informed my work . But you know ,
to see China and the scale at which it &apos;s evolving , is quite something .
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam ,
and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man .
Most of the engineers around the world left the project
In fact , when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago ,
they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning .
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that
was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir ,
and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
This is a &quot; before and after . &quot; So that was before .
And this is like 10 weeks later , demolished by hand .
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite ,
everything else was by hand . That was 10 weeks later .
And it was all the people who lived in those homes ,
were the ones that were actually taking it apart
and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart .
And these are some of the images from that .
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam ,
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape , but it isn &apos;t .
What it is , it &apos;s a landscape that is an intentional one .
This is a need for power , and they &apos;re willing to go through this
massive transformation , on this scale , to get that power .
And again , it &apos;s actually a relief for what &apos;s going on in China
There hasn &apos;t been one built in North America for 20 years
because of the &quot; NIMBY &quot; problem -- &quot; Not In My BackYard . &quot;
But in China they &apos;re saying , &quot; No , we &apos;re putting in 27 in the next 10 years . &quot;
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems .
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges --
a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost ;
some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that .
This is Wushan , one of the largest cities that was relocated .
And again , the rebuilding of the city -- to me , it was sad to see
that they didn &apos;t really grab a lot of , I guess ,
what we know here , in terms of urban planning .
There were no parks ; there were no green spaces .
Very high-density living on the side of a hill .
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up ,
Here is a sign that , translated , says , &quot; Obey the birth control law .
Build our science , civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth . &quot;
But what &apos;s really , to me , frightening about the picture
and about this billboard is the refinery in the background .
So it &apos;s like marrying up all the things that we have
and it &apos;s an adaptation of our way of life , full stop .
And again , when you start seeing that kind of embrace ,
and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle
with a very , very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle
with a much higher footprint , it starts to become very sobering .
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong --
and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .
trying to get into urban centers at all times ,
and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expecting
into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers .
the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact
So this is a pink uniform at this factory . It &apos;s a shoe factory .
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms .
This is one of the biggest shoe factories , the Yuyuan shoe factory
There &apos;s two factories of this scale in the same town .
The next round comes in . It &apos;s an incredible workforce
and this is a whole area that will be flattened
and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years .
five years ago , for instance . This is a holdout .
They &apos;re called dengzahoos -- they &apos;re like pin tacks to the ground .
They &apos;re not getting enough , so they &apos;re not going to move .
And so they &apos;re holding off until they get a deal with them .
And they &apos;ve been actually quite successful in getting better deals
because most of them are getting a raw deal .
the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years ,
are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas
outside of Shanghai . But these are a whole series of guys
And then the embrace of the things that they &apos;re replacing it with --
again , one of my wishes , and I never ended up going there ,
was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house .
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something ,
The scaffolding is still on , and this is an e-waste area ,
and if you looked in the foreground on the big print ,
you &apos;d see that the industry -- their industry -- they &apos;re all recycling .
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it &apos;s exploding on a level
one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people ,
and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million .
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which --
this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen .
and they &apos;re being built for most of the big cities ,
And this isn &apos;t even the domestic car market ; this is the taxi market .
And what we would see here as a suburban development --
So they &apos;ll put 20 or 40 up at a time ,
and they just go up in the same way
as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area .
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out
is that when I saw these kinds of buildings ,
And I &apos;m sure there are people here who probably
but I can &apos;t imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner
is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .
and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai ,
It &apos;s breathtaking , in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming .
And you can see in the foreground of this picture ,
it &apos;s still one of the last areas that was being held up .
Right now that &apos;s all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago --
and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
So a skyscraper is built , literally , overnight in Shanghai .
Most recently I went in , and I started looking
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers .
It &apos;s an incredibly massive operation , I think 15,000 workers ,
five cupolas , and the sixth one &apos;s coming in here .
to try to deal with the demand for steel in China .
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .
And again , looking at these images , there &apos;s this constant , like , haze that you &apos;re seeing .
This is going to show you , real time , an assembler . It &apos;s a circuit breaker .
is that they &apos;re using a lot of the latest production technology .
In that one , there were 400 people that worked on the floor .
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers ,
and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes ,
But that is the trick that they &apos;ve got right now ,
but the assembly is where they &apos;re actually bringing in --
the country workers are very willing to work . They want to work .
There &apos;s a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs .
That condition &apos;s going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years
if they realize what they want , which is , you know ,
400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities .
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw ;
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field .
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot .
because they were just going . To slow them down was literally impossible .
They were just wound up doing these things all day long ,
until the manager had to , with a stern voice , say ,
but they &apos;re driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk , an oil byproduct .
There are 500 of these machines ; they &apos;re worth about 200,000 dollars each .
and they &apos;re just inspecting it -- and they &apos;re just walking the lines .
absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are .
And I started getting in further and further into the factories .
And that &apos;s a diptych . I do a lot of pairings
to try and get the sense of scale in these places .
This is a line where they get the threads
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor .
It was very hard to get into the international companies
because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas ,
It just gives you a sense of , again -- and that &apos;s where ,
really , the whole migration of jobs started going over to China
and making the shoes . Nike was one of the early ones .
It was such a high labor component to it
that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market .
This is a high-tech mobile phone : Bird mobile phone ,
and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones .
This is a textile where they &apos;re doing shirts --
Youngor , the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China .
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms .
people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch .
This was one of the biggest factories I &apos;ve ever seen .
they make 20 million of them in the world .
There &apos;s 21,000 employees . This one factory -- and they had several of them --
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago ,
so you &apos;re the first ones to be seeing these ,
So it &apos;s taken me almost a year to gain access into these places .
is that there &apos;s a real need for materials there .
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here
are being recycled and taken to China by ships .
where they &apos;re getting the copper and the high-end steel
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley .
But this is what happens to most of the computers .
Fifty percent of the world &apos;s computers end up in China to be recycled .
And it is a bit of a problem . The way they recycle the boards
which are used all through China , but they heat up the boards ,
and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components .
They &apos;re trying to get all the valued metals out of those components .
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town
that &apos;s actually doing this kind of burning of the boards ,
you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there .
so it &apos;s not big places -- it &apos;s all in people &apos;s front porches ,
in their backyards , even in their homes they &apos;re burning boards ,
if there &apos;s a concern for somebody coming by --
because it is considered in China to be illegal , doing it ,
but they can &apos;t stop the product from coming in .
This portrait -- I &apos;m not usually known for portraits ,
but I couldn &apos;t resist this one , where she &apos;s been through Mao ,
and the Cultural Revolution , and now she &apos;s sitting on her porch
This is a road where it &apos;s been shored up by computer boards
in one of the biggest towns where they &apos;re recycling .
So that &apos;s the photographs that I wanted to show you .
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls .
They &apos;ve been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I &apos;ve been thinking .
One &apos;s Megan , the one of the right , and Katja there .
the things I &apos;m photographing are out of a great concern
about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .
And as much as there are great things around the corner --
of all of the things that are just about to break
I &apos;m really hoping that those things will spread around the world
And it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affecting our world ,
but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting
our footprint and bring it down -- but there &apos;s a growing footprint
that &apos;s happening in Asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate ,
and so I don &apos;t think we can equalize it . So ultimately the strategy ,
I think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution ,
because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well .
So part of my thinking , and part of my wishes ,
&quot; How is their life going to be when they want to have children ,
or when they &apos;re ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever ,
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking --
in my work , and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes .
Wish one : world-changing . I want to use my images
to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability .
that I believe that that is not an unreal idea .
Oh , and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind ,
hitch it onto something . I didn &apos;t want a wish just to start from nowhere .
One of them I &apos;m starting from almost nothing , but the other one ,
I wanted to find out what &apos;s going on that &apos;s working right now .
is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month .
is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like .
What they &apos;re doing there is that they &apos;re not --
being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out .
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog
about how to change our world in a better way , quickly .
And it &apos;s looking at technology , and it &apos;s looking at new energy-saving devices ,
and it &apos;s looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize
And so for me , one of the things that I thought
would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting
Some of you might know , he &apos;s a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I
are working on some layouts . And this is still in preliminary stages ;
these aren &apos;t the finals . But these images , with Worldchanging.com ,
they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter , or anything of that nature .
So we &apos;re looking at this as trying to build out .
was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text ,
is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .
because it &apos;s about a lot of these images and what they represent ,
that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say ,
&quot; Well , what &apos;s Worldchanging.com , with these images , have to do ? &quot;
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website .
So Worldchanging.com , and building that blog , and it is a blog ,
and I &apos;m hoping that it isn &apos;t -- I don &apos;t see it as the kind of blog
where we &apos;re all going to follow each other to death .
This one is one that will spoke out , and will go out ,
and to start reaching . Because right now there &apos;s conversations
I think there &apos;s a chance to have a dialogue , a conversation
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .
Wish two is more of the bottom-up , ground-up one that I &apos;m trying to work with .
And this one is : I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition
that motivates kids to invest ideas on , and invent ideas on , sustainability .
And one of the things that came out --
Allison , who actually nominated me , said something earlier on
in a brainstorming . She said that recycling in Canada
had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six .
grade four -- my wife and I , we say age seven is the age of reason ,
so they &apos;re into the age of reason . And they &apos;re pre-puberty .
So it &apos;s this great window where they actually are --
you can influence them . You know what happens at puberty ?
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids
to start driving home ideas . Let them understand what sustainability is ,
and that they have a vested interest in it to happen .
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize ,
so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings ,
and the rest is going to be to manage this project ,
but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands .
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic
was to create these -- call them &quot; prize targets . &quot;
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea
for an in-school project , the best one for a household project ,
or it could be the best community project for sustainability .
And I also thought there should be a nice prize
for the best artwork for &quot; In My World . &quot; And what would happen --
it &apos;s a scalable thing . And if we can get people to put in things --
or money to make the prize significant enough --
and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools ,
to go after those prizes and to submit them .
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing , so it &apos;s not about just ideas .
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them
and do them , but the actual things have to be verifiable .
we &apos;re motivating a certain age group to start thinking .
And they &apos;re going to push that up , from the bottom -- up into ,
I believe , into the households . And parents will be reacting to it ,
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability
and starts to teach them . They know about recycling now ,
but they don &apos;t really , I think , get sustainability in all the things ,
And to teach them , to me , would be a fantastic wish ,
and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into .
And again , in &quot; In My World , &quot; the competition --
we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it .
because it gives possession of the world to the person who &apos;s doing it .
It is my world ; it &apos;s not someone else &apos;s . I want to help it ;
I want to do something with it . So I think it has a great opportunity
to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas , I think , come from kids --
I think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash --
it &apos;s going to be an incentive for them to do that .
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where
we could possibly put in some promotion for &quot; In My World . &quot;
And wish three is : Imax film . So I was told I should do one for myself ,
and I &apos;ve always wanted to actually get involved with doing something .
And the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas I &apos;m playing with --
when I first saw an Imax film , I almost immediately thought ,
&quot; There &apos;s a real resonance between what I &apos;m trying to do
and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer . &quot;
to reach new audiences if I had a chance .
So I &apos;m looking , really , for a mentor , because I just had my birthday .
I &apos;m 50 , and I don &apos;t have time to go back to school right now --
who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that ,
and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this .
That would be fantastic . So those are my three wishes .
I want to start my talk today with two observations
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious ,
that no other species on the planet does right now .
Of course , in addition to being smart , we &apos;re also an extremely vain species .
So we like pointing out the fact that we &apos;re smart .
You know , so I could turn to pretty much any sage
and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet
But of course , there &apos;s a second observation about the human species
that I want to focus on a little bit more ,
even though we &apos;re actually really smart , sometimes uniquely smart ,
when it comes to some aspects of our decision making .
Don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m not going to call anyone in particular out
But of course , just in the last two years
And we &apos;ve watched as the tools we uniquely make
We &apos;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --
these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --
we &apos;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .
But both of these two embarrassing examples , I think ,
which is that we &apos;d like to think that the mistakes we make
are really just the result of a couple bad apples
or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions .
But it turns out , what social scientists are actually learning
is that most of us , when put in certain contexts ,
we still , the next time we &apos;re face with a certain context ,
And so this has been a real puzzle to me
how is a species that &apos;s as smart as we are
You know , we &apos;re the smartest thing out there , why can &apos;t we figure this out ?
In some sense , where do our mistakes really come from ?
And having thought about this a little bit , I see a couple different possibilities .
One possibility is , in some sense , it &apos;s not really our fault .
sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand ,
We create mortgage terms that we can &apos;t actually deal with .
And of course , if we are put in environments where we can &apos;t deal with it ,
If this was the case , we &apos;d have a really easy solution
But there &apos;s another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying ,
which is , maybe it &apos;s not our environments that are messed up .
from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors .
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors
It feels like we might almost just be built
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about ,
it &apos;s not actually clear how we go about dealing with it .
We might just have to accept the fact that we &apos;re error prone
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at .
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two ?
but doesn &apos;t have access to any of the systems we have ,
any of the things that might mess us up --
And so this is why we turned to these guys here .
These are one of the guys I work with . This is a brown capuchin monkey .
which means they broke off from the human branch
This means that your great , great , great great , great , great --
grandmother was probably the same great , great , great , great
You know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant ,
she doesn &apos;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
You know , she &apos;s a smart , very cut creature , a primate as well ,
but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up .
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans ?
Does she not learn from them ? And so on .
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do .
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago .
We said , all right , let &apos;s , you know , throw so problems at Holly ,
First problem is just , well , where should we start ?
Because , you know , it &apos;s great for us , but bad for humans .
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts .
You know , where are we actually going to start with this ?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse ,
around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news ,
and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do .
Of course , that &apos;s when we hit a sort second problem --
but monkeys don &apos;t actually use money . I know , you haven &apos;t met them .
But this is why , you know , they &apos;re not in the queue behind you
at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know , they don &apos;t do this stuff .
So now we faced , you know , a little bit of a problem here .
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money
So we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just suck it up
What you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of
We weren &apos;t very creative at the time we started these studies ,
But this is the unit of currency that we &apos;ve taught our monkeys at Yale
It doesn &apos;t look like much -- in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
Like most of our money , it &apos;s just a piece of metal .
As those of you who &apos;ve taken currencies home from your trip know ,
before they realized what they could do with it .
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures ,
they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them .
to different humans in the lab for some food .
And so you see one of our monkeys , Mayday , up here doing this .
This is A and B are kind of the points where she &apos;s sort of a little bit
and Mayday quickly figures out , apparently the human wants this .
It turns out not just Mayday , all of our monkeys get good
So here &apos;s just a quick video of what this looks like .
Here &apos;s Mayday . She &apos;s going to be trading a token for some food
Here &apos;s Felix , I think . He &apos;s our alpha male ; he &apos;s a kind of big guy .
But he too waits patiently , gets his food and goes on .
They &apos;re surprisingly good at this with very little training .
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own .
The question is : is this anything like human money ?
or did we just do a weird psychologist &apos;s trick
And so we said , well , what would the monkeys spontaneously do
if this was really their currency , if they were really using it like money ?
that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other .
You might have them start paying attention to price ,
sort of keeping track of their monkey token , as it were .
our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure .
into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market .
it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets
because , as the monkeys entered the door of the market ,
a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens
And over time , they did basically the same thing
who sold what at what price -- you know , who was reliable , who wasn &apos;t , and so on .
And you can see that each of the experimenters
is actually holding up a little , yellow food dish .
and that &apos;s what the monkey can for a single token .
but as you can see , sometimes tokens buy more than others ,
So I &apos;ll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like .
Here &apos;s a monkey-eye-view . Monkeys are shorter , so it &apos;s a little short .
She &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little impatiently .
All of a sudden the market opens . Here &apos;s her choice : one grapes or two grapes .
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two .
most of the monkeys went with guys who had more .
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .
When we introduced sales , we saw the monkeys paid attention to that .
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists
to actually look at the monkeys &apos; data using economic tools ,
So much so that , if you saw the monkeys &apos; numbers ,
you couldn &apos;t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market .
Question is : do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do ?
Well , we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might .
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace
The monkeys entered the market , spent their entire budget
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --
you know , things we didn &apos;t necessarily think we were introducing ,
are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do ?
you know , see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years .
And so , since the best way to see how people go wrong
I &apos;m going to give you guys a quick experiment
to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action .
a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills .
and spend a second thinking about what you &apos;re going to do with it .
Because it &apos;s yours now ; you can buy whatever you want .
Sounds great , but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .
And here &apos;s your choice : you can either be risky ,
in which case I &apos;m going to flip one of these monkey tokens .
If it comes up heads , you &apos;re going to get a thousand dollars more .
So it &apos;s a chance to get more , but it &apos;s pretty risky .
Your other option is a bit safe . Your just going to get some money for sure .
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately .
Most people say , why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure ?
This seems like a good bet . I &apos;m going to go with that .
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before .
Think about how you &apos;d feel sticking it in your wallet .
And now imagine that I have you make another choice
Now , you &apos;re going to be deciding how you &apos;re going to lose money ,
so I &apos;ll flip a coin . If it comes up heads , you &apos;re going to actually lose a lot .
If it comes up tails , you lose nothing , you &apos;re fine , get to keep the whole thing --
or you could play it safe , which means you have to reach back into your wallet
and give me five of those $ 100 bills , for certain .
And I &apos;m seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there .
as the subjects that were actually tested in this ,
The reason this is irrational is that we &apos;ve given people in both situations
It &apos;s a 50 / 50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,
But people &apos;s intuitions about how much risk to take
Well , it turns out that this seems to be the result
of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level .
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms .
You really have to do work to figure out ,
Instead , we find it very easy to think in very relative terms
So we think of things as , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to get more , &quot; or &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to get less . &quot;
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red .
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money .
What you saw in that last scenario is that
because they want the small shot that there won &apos;t be any loss .
That means when we &apos;re in a risk mindset --
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans .
They &apos;re why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --
They &apos;re why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --
because they don &apos;t want to sell at a loss .
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market ,
And so this is what we did , we gave the monkeys choices
between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --
And then we gave them options that were bonuses --
like you guys did in the first scenario --
they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got .
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen .
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape ,
The guy on the left is a safe bonus .
All the time , he adds one , to give the monkeys two .
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus .
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero .
But this is the same choice you guys just faced .
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe
and then go with the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing on every trial ,
and try to get a risky , but big , bonus ,
You might say , well , maybe the monkeys just don &apos;t like risk .
Maybe we should see how they do with losses .
And so we ran a second version of this .
So they look like they &apos;re starting out with a big amount .
These are three grapes ; the monkey &apos;s really psyched for this .
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect .
They guy on the left is a safe loss .
Every single time , he &apos;s going to take one of these away
the guy on the right is the risky loss .
Sometimes he gives no loss , so the monkeys are really psyched ,
taking away two to give the monkeys only one .
or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three .
The remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice ,
they do the same irrational thing that people do .
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too
and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains .
Well , what we &apos;ve shown is that , first of all ,
we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency ,
They do some of the smart things we do ,
some of the kind of not so nice things we do ,
But they also do some of the irrational things we do .
This is the first take-home message of the Talk ,
which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought ,
oh , I &apos;m totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser .
They &apos;re way cuter than the one at ... you know --
Don &apos;t do that ; they &apos;re probably going to be just as dumb
So , you know , a little bad -- Sorry , sorry , sorry .
But of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laughing is bad for humans too .
Because we &apos;ve answered the question we started out with .
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from .
And we started with the hope that maybe we can
But what we &apos;ve learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that .
In fact , they might be due to the very nature
at the right side of this chain that &apos;s duncey .
Maybe it &apos;s sort of duncey all the way back .
And this , if we believe the capuchin monkey results ,
to potentially get changed around -- really , really old .
What do we know about other old strategies like this ?
Well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome .
You can &apos;t just look at the dessert cart as say , &quot; No , no , no . That looks disgusting to me . &quot;
We &apos;re going to perceive it as a good thing to go after .
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true
When you &apos;re watching your stocks plummet into the red ,
you &apos;re not going to be able to see that
So that &apos;s the bad news . The question is : is there any good news ?
I &apos;m supposed to be up here telling you the good news .
is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk ,
to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom .
We &apos;re so good at overcoming our biological limitations --
you know , I flew over here in an airplane .
I didn &apos;t have to try to flap my wings .
I &apos;m wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you .
I don &apos;t have to rely on my own near-sightedness .
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations .
It was Camus who once said that , &quot; Man is the only species
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations ,
and then use the world of design to actually figure them out .
That might be the only way that we will really be able
and really be the noble species we hope to all be .
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man ,
about a lot of the stuff in your life .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
And of course , it &apos;s your stuff if it &apos;s broken .
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry ,
that we don &apos;t necessarily leave these toddler rules behind
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff ,
but it &apos;s a tiny drop of the durable goods
that are disposed each and every year around the world --
that gets discarded around the world each and every year --
and that &apos;s one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth ,
And the reason we see mines is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable raw materials
that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
that we figure out how to extract these raw materials
the world &apos;s getting to be a smaller place with more people in it
And of course , they want the toys and the tools
And what goes into making those toys and tools
It &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff
particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe
if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
and I &apos;m using steel as a proxy here for metals ,
are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .
Now most people think that &apos;s because plastics are a throw-away material ,
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material
So it &apos;s very easy for either humans or machines
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans
is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world --
and sadly to say , particularly from the United States ,
where we don &apos;t have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe --
People , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
They extract what they can , which is mostly the metals --
and they leave behind mostly what they can &apos;t recover ,
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals
those other methods don &apos;t lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously --
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops
of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai , India .
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these ,
and people try very hard to separate the plastics ,
And sometimes they &apos;ll resort to what &apos;s known as the &quot; burn and sniff &quot; technique
where they &apos;ll burn the plastic and smell the fumes
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling
So what are we to do about this space-age material ,
at least what we used to call a space-aged material , these plastics ?
Well I certainly believe that it &apos;s far too valuable and far too abundant
So about 20 years ago , I literally started in my garage tinkering around ,
in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world ,
and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .
to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
You breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways ,
to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
We said , there &apos;s got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
as I hope that you &apos;ve been able to see from the photographs .
And because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules
we &apos;re using a mining approach to extract the materials .
I don &apos;t know how many other projects on the planet right now
can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars
that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life ,
our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .
They get to close the loop with their products .
I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
and leave behind what &apos;s called shredder residue -- it &apos;s their waste --
such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber ,
And it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycling .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
At the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite :
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process ,
and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
And out the end of that part of the process
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We push that material to extruders where we melt it ,
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
and it &apos;s going right back into your new stuff .
back on top of your desk in new products ,
So I hope I &apos;ve changed the way you look at
at least some of the stuff in your life .
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --
that &apos;s a label I &apos;ve always hated my entire life --
and think of yourself as just using resources in one form ,
to change that last toddler rule just a little bit
If you come in you will see us : evening time ,
at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled --
at the point when dinner is ready to be served .
sometimes she said she couldn &apos;t tell who was who and where they were .
we would have to , we say , &quot; Fix a plate &quot; for that person , put it in the oven ,
then we could say grace , and we could eat .
when something significant had happened for any one of us --
whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA ,
or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination ,
or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent --
the ritual at the family was , once the announcement is made ,
we must take five , ten minutes to do what we call &quot; make over &quot; that person --
that is , to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way .
Also , we had to make a report on our extended &quot; visited &quot; members ,
My task was , at least once a week , to visit Mother Lassiter
and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .
For mom said , &quot; To be family , is to care and share and to look out for one another .
And , of course , sometimes there was a bonus for going .
Mom says , &quot; If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them ,
And if they insist , say , &apos; Whatever you mind to give me . &apos; &quot;
This was the nature of being at that table .
In fact , she indicated that if we would do that ,
not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude
but she said , &quot; Even God will smile , and when God smiles ,
So , at the table at 915 , I learned something about compassion .
And so , I came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal ,
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing ,
we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world .
Now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion .
It was Christmas , and at our family , oh , what a morning .
where we have special prayers , and where we get to the old upright piano
and we would sing carols . It was a very intimate moment .
In fact , you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing ,
and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration .
We thought he must be out of his mind .
This is when we can just be who we are ,
with his shirt and tie on , while we are still in our PJs .
Any other time , but not to the Christmas celebration .
&quot; Well , you know what ? If you really understand the nature of this celebration ,
it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love .
It &apos;s time to make space , to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community . &quot;
But growing up at 915 , compassion was not a word to be debated ;
it was a sensibility to how we are together .
And , like Chief Seattle said , &quot; We did not spin the web of life .
And whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . &quot;
So , let me tell you , I kind of look at the world this way .
I see pictures , and something says , &quot; Now , that &apos;s compassion . &quot;
A harvested field of grain , with some grain in the corners ,
but you must always leave some on the edges ,
I see -- always , it stirs my heart --
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel
and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled ,
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters
without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity
robbing us of a sense of unity of being .
So , there &apos;s another picture . Here , this one . I really do like this picture .
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis .
&quot; It &apos;s going to be too volatile for you to go . &quot;
and Bobby stands up and says to the people ,
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated .
and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity
he said , &quot; what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel .
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away .
And he said , &quot; I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did .
I allowed my anger , my bitterness , my grief to simmer a while ,
and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world ,
That &apos;s a picture . Compassion ? I think I see it .
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor ,
and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world .
and they each read in their own language a central affirmation ,
and that was some version of the golden rule :
&quot; As you would that others would do unto you ,
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire
We are so connected that we must treat each other
as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .
One more picture while I &apos;m stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church :
&quot; That evening , when a service was held at the Riverside Church ,
we carried it on our station in this city .
It was , &quot; he said , &quot; one of the most powerful moments of life together .
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come ,
that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated ,
And they all spoke out of their own traditions ,
a word about the healing power of solidarity , one with the other . &quot;
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature ,
Now , as a preacher , I got a job . I got to preach the stuff ,
Or , as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks ,
So , the real issue is : How do you tangibilitate compassion ?
In my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions --
to everybody around the world who knows the story of the &quot; Good Samaritan . &quot;
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity ,
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly ,
you will discover that a question has been raised
you must love the Lord your God with all your heart , mind and soul ,
And then the person asked , &quot; Well , what do you mean , &apos; neighbor ? &apos; &quot;
And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves ,
and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way ;
And he said , &quot; Here , this is the initial investment ,
but if needs continue , make sure that you provide them .
And whatever else is needed , I will provide it and pay for it when I return . &quot;
This always seemed to me to be a deepening
of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan .
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched
but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that ,
&apos;a system of sustained care &apos; -- in the inn , take care .
I think maybe it &apos;s one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system
and a commitment to do whatever is necessary --
that all God &apos;s children would have their needs cared for ,
so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks , &quot; In regards to health ,
are all the children in ? &quot; And we could say yes .
Oh , what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion .
for the prisoners , for the infirm , for children --
even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs .
But now , to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say ,
and to be a good American -- for me ,
is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street
must be done around tables and rituals of faith
So , let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion ,
and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history .
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion .
The reason it &apos;s important is because this is a very special time in history .
It is the time that , biblically , we would speak of as
Please pardon me , as a black man , for celebrating
that the election of Obama was an unusual sign
of the fact that it is a year of favor .
And yet , there is so much more that needs to be done .
We need to bring health and food and education
and respect for all God &apos;s citizens , all God &apos;s children ,
Now , let me close my comments by telling you
And so I want to close with a little song .
I close with this song -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song --
because we are all children at the table of mama eternal .
this song will make sense , not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,
but to all who sign the charter for compassion .
The song says , ? &quot; I made heaven so happy today , ?
? Receiving God &apos;s love and giving it away ?
? When I looked up , heaven smiled at me ?
? Now , I &apos;m so happy . Can &apos;t you see ? ?
? I &apos;m happy . Look at me . I &apos;m happy . Can &apos;t you see ? ?
? Sharing makes me happy , makes heaven happy too ?
? I &apos;m happy . Look at me . I &apos;m happy . Can &apos;t you see ? ?
? Let me share my happy loving smile with you . ?
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal .
I &apos;ve been telling a story that has been so painful for me .
It &apos;s been a tough journey for me , traveling the world ,
when I was doing it in form of a music .
So I have branded myself as a war child .
because of an old lady in my village now ,
and what she wants to change in this society .
who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story ,
would tell me , &quot; Don &apos;t give up . Keep on going . &quot;
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it ,
because I didn &apos;t know what I was putting myself into .
Well I was born in the most difficult time ,
The world that meant a lot to me , I saw it
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five .
were detached and I still have issues with him .
And that made me call myself a war child .
was an image that I saw that stuck in my head .
When I went to the training camp I say ,
The training wasn &apos;t easy , but that was the driving force ,
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us ,
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose :
should I continue to hate , or let it go ?
I even had a movie out called &quot; War Child , &quot;
So I &apos;m just going to go into a different step now ,
when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food
Voices in my brain , of friends that was slain .
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh
I knew it was rude , but we needed food .
One year later , live with an AK-47 by my side .
But still as I wonder , I won &apos;t go under .
Yet as I wage this new war I &apos;m not alone in this drama .
No sit or stop , as I reach for the top
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right .
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it &apos;s you
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns .
So many people die that I don &apos;t even cry no more .
And why , why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write ,
I know it &apos;s a shame . But who is to be blamed ?
That &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do .
So the music had been my therapy for me .
where I can be a child again , in dances , through music .
You know , if you fall in love with a frog , that &apos;s it .
But I don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t hate their music .
And one thing that shocked me is one day
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music .
So now I &apos;m doing music so I know what the power of music is .
I donate it to a charity that I founded
because we want to build a school in Sudan .
it &apos;s a normal thing in my home , people eat one meal a day .
Here I am in the West . I choose not to .
it means he got the money to build our school .
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month ,
And I said , &quot; No stop until we get it . &quot;
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents .
because I know what it can do to my people .
For so many years we have fed on aid .
They only get the food that drops from the sky , from the U.N.
you &apos;re killing a whole generation if you just give them aid .
It &apos;s rain . Africa is fertile . They can grow the crops .
that are creating wars in Africa . They will die soon .
mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
And I said &quot; I &apos;m going to put it in practice . &quot;
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things .
so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker
that made it possible for me to be here .
just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference .
She came to my country and saw the importance
so that they could come and create a revolution
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me .
? If Emma never rescued me ? What would I be ? ?
? You would have seen my face on the telly ?
? Flies in my eyes , head too big for my size ?
? Running around in Africa , born to be wild ?
? for sending an angel to rescue me ?
? I got a reason for being on this Earth ?
? &apos; Cause I know more than many what a life is worth ?
? Now that I got a chance to stand my ground ?
? I &apos;m gonna run over mountains , leaps and bounds ?
? I ain &apos;t an angel , hope I &apos;ll be one soon ?
? And if I am , I wanna be like Emma McCune ?
? I would have probably died from starvation ?
? I would have grown up with no education ?
? I know there is a lot of Emmas out there ?
? Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child ?
? I remember the time when I was small ?
? When I couldn &apos;t read or write at all ?
? Now I &apos;m all grown up , I got my education ?
? How I prayed for this day to come ?
? And I pray that the world find wisdom ?
? To give the poor in need some assistance ?
? Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this ?
? Popping champagne and sponging off the masses ?
? I &apos;d be a corpse on the African plain ?
Is there anybody who &apos;s here in the back , some love .
? Yeah , I would have probably died from starvation ?
? I would have grown up with no education ?
