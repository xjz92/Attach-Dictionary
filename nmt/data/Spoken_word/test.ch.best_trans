My dream is that we don &apos;t think about it .
&quot; The _UNK_ &quot; was the hardest film to see .
And when we ask people to join us
I think the environmental movement should be _UNK_ ,
How do you improve the life of all human beings ?
I think one of the problems that we face ,
is the people who controls the market :
If we let some of the right projects increase ,
In fact , in the Western world , we have _UNK_ .
Perhaps some of the places in the world are still lacking , but we have enough .
And we knew that this was not a good measure .
In fact , the designer of our accounting system ,
Indeed , it may be appropriate to the production standard in history .
In World War II , we have to make a lot of things .
Indeed , what we &apos;ve done in some of these things ,
that we destroy the great part of Europe and then have to rebuild .
It &apos;s not ridiculous ? This is the standard that we measure ,
It &apos;s the truth , but it &apos;s a little bit _UNK_ than happiness ,
We all need love and _UNK_ in our lives .
We all want to have a good life in our health .
Why don &apos;t we think about the progress of the country
Indeed , this is what I &apos;ve been doing after age --
where I was going to work in my office ,
because we think that people should be happy and should be happy .
Why don &apos;t we build a index to measure the progress of this ?
is that we point out that the final index of a country
to the life of happiness for its citizens .
And that &apos;s how much resources we use on the planet .
We only have a planet , we all need to share it .
It will consider how much we pay for our employees .
And the standard measure how much of the Earth &apos;s resources
probably the most easy way to say that
This is a measure of how much natural resources we use .
and how much pressure we give to the planet .
_UNK_ the quality and quantity of life in all countries .
That _UNK_ is the average of the world .
is some countries that are happy to do better ,
But the price is that they use a lot of resources on the planet .
is the countries that don &apos;t have enough happiness --
In many of these countries , the average person
in the upper left-hand corner of this graph .
We &apos;re going to be here , and there &apos;s not going to be much resources on the planet .
that country in the top of the country
based on the latest _UNK_ of global warming ,
And one quarter of the things that we have ,
They are 99 percent of their electricity from renewable energy .
Their government was the first promise to have
They have a world in Latin America and even in Latin America .
And the challenge is that maybe we might think about --
And we need to _UNK_ the country on the right .
So we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
Another way to see happiness is to look at historical developments .
We don &apos;t have good data to go back to every country in the world ,
But we have some of the richest countries in the world .
And this is the history of the happy index ,
And the main point here is , I think ,
I said to you that this is not a _UNK_ .
means that we have to change the way we create organizations ,
and the way to do it , and the way to live .
that the quality of life is going to fall down .
I think we all want humans to be better .
I think this is why there is climate change and _UNK_ people .
I think that &apos;s what they want , they &apos;re going to continue to live .
They &apos;re going to stay in all of these things .
That means that we really need to go further and improve our efficiency .
It &apos;s easy to make some diagram or something like this ,
But the point is that we &apos;re going to take those curves .
And this is what I think we should be
The right information is correct in the right time .
When you see how much power you &apos;re using ,
Your child will soon turn the lights off the lights .
Why is the news of every night
I hear the 100 index in the London Times , Dow Jones index , the dollar &apos;s exchange rate --
I don &apos;t know who the dollar is a good news .
Why don &apos;t I hear how much energy I used yesterday ,
You give it to the media and start thinking .
At the government level , they can establish national happiness index .
In business , you can see if your employees are happy ,
And we need a lot of innovation to face the environment .
And from the personal perspective , we need these _UNK_ .
Maybe we don &apos;t need that data , but we need to remind .
In Britain , we have a strong message about public health ,
and how we &apos;re going to do it -- I &apos;m not very good at it .
There &apos;s no five things that we should do every day .
A few years ago we did a project for the government ,
a lot of people -- including a lot of experts --
The part of what we do is : you can do what are five positive things .
But I think happiness will come from those positive actions .
You spend a lot of time in your mind ,
Go out and go up and down , open the radio to dance .
you care about the _UNK_ of the world ,
Do you notice what &apos;s wrong with you , and what &apos;s going to happen ?
Their health conditions are much better than those who have been _UNK_ .
But it doesn &apos;t need formal learning ; it &apos;s not for learning .
This can be a new dish for the _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ the instrument that you &apos;ve done when you were a kid .
The two groups are going to be 100 dollars .
And you let them spend the money on their own .
At the end of this day , you assess their _UNK_ ,
the group of people who spend money on others
I &apos;m going to say that this is not the resources of the Earth ,
to do these positive actions don &apos;t need a lot of stuff .
and we need to go to the top ,
More than that , we need to create a _UNK_ .
We also need to have a good thing on this _UNK_ road .
we can create a world that we all want ,
On September 10 , in the morning of my seven birthday ,
I went downstairs to the kitchen and saw my mother washing dishes .
And my father had a newspaper in _UNK_
When they found me in the kitchen , they _UNK_ me and said ,
And I said , &quot; Of course , I &apos;ll have a birthday party , cake cake ,
and you get a lot of gifts . &quot; My father said , &quot; Yes .
But more important , seven years old means that you &apos;re at the age of rational age .
Now you have the ability to commit all God and mankind .
I &apos;ve heard about the age of rational age .
But that was just in the secondary grade . And when she mentioned it ,
and because we all _UNK_ in order to communicate with our first religious confession
And you know that that &apos;s just white dress and _UNK_ .
Anyway , I didn &apos;t really care about the age of rational age .
So I said , &quot; Okay , rational age , what do you mean ? &quot;
My father said , &quot; We believe in Catholic
Do we think God knows that children have no _UNK_ ability ?
But when you get to seven , you &apos;ve got this ability .
And you get to the rational age , now ,
God will start recording your behavior , and the records will become your eternal file . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , wait , wait , you mean ,
I &apos;ve been a good kid today , but God never noticed ? &quot;
I thought , &quot; How could I know this before ?
They &apos;ve been telling me , how do I have no _UNK_ ?
When such a good child , there is no credit for it .
And the worst thing is , I &apos;ve got this important message to me that I didn &apos;t use that day .
to find out that this is the case . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Dad , the Christmas man ?
I mean , Christmas man knows you &apos;re _UNK_ , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
I think that &apos;s restricted to _UNK_ Day and Christmas . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yes , Bob , Bob , tell him directly ,
You see , she &apos;s seven . _UNK_ , there &apos;s no Christmas man in the world . &quot;
In fact , I was not struck by the _UNK_ .
My parents had made a great story about Santa _UNK_ :
How do they talk to the Santa _UNK_ and decide
even though the Christmas man is in the Christmas Eve .
and let them open a gift on Christmas morning ,
Let him nine in the Christmas morning , when we were in the Mass ,
to give us a gift , and if our children don &apos;t make any trouble .
It was obvious that our parents were giving us a gift .
And Dad had a very unique packaging style ,
And my mother &apos;s writing is so close to Santa _UNK_ .
In addition , Christmas man went to the rest of the family
And how are we going to get to our house ?
And the big deal of evidence , I came up with a clear conclusion :
And my parents just wanted to protect us
Don &apos;t let us be _UNK_ by the _UNK_ Santa _UNK_ .
But the truth is that he is not just happy , he also likes to judge others .
So , for the fact that Christmas man is not there , I really _UNK_ a breath .
I was not quite surprised when I left the kitchen .
How do I know nothing about the age of rational age .
Now I know these _UNK_ are too late , but I can help others ,
First of all , their older age should be enough ,
to understand the concept of &quot; rational age ; Second , they don &apos;t have seven years old .
The answer was obvious : my brother Bill . He was six years old .
I found Bill in a street near a street .
He &apos;s on the playground in a public school . That day is Saturday .
Bill was there and looked at the wall with a wall .
I just realized that rational age begins in your seven years ,
On the day of your seven th birthday , you can _UNK_ all God and human sin .
And Bill said , &quot; How did that ? &quot; I said ,
You &apos;re six years old . You can do what you &apos;re going to do .
And God doesn &apos;t notice it . &quot; And he said , &quot; How do I go ? &quot;
&quot; How ? _UNK_ ! &quot; I run around . I &apos;m really _UNK_ .
But when I went to the top _UNK_ , my _UNK_ ,
and said , &quot; Yeah , Bill , Christmas man is not there . &quot;
My seven - year - old birthday is not really in September .
I prepared a night party for the _UNK_ birthday ,
But a few weeks ago , mom took me to the table and said ,
Your birthday is not September 10 , October . &quot; What do I say ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Listen to me . The _UNK_ &apos;s _UNK_ was born on September _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; So I told them your birthday was September _UNK_ ,
But I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re not going to tell someone about your real birthday date ,
So I &apos;ll tell you that your birthday is September 11 .
_UNK_ , you can get to school at the time , dear . It &apos;s all right . &quot;
I thought , when I was four years old ,
And there was another child in the stomach .
So she meant that she needed to school ,
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , _UNK_ , October , when your birthday ,
to eat a cake at that day . &quot;
My mom has been _UNK_ with me , in my _UNK_ .
And the news really made me feel sick ,
not because I had to tell all my best girlfriend
And the most _UNK_ thing is that I &apos;m not _UNK_ .
I put a big _UNK_ in my bedroom ,
I read my daily day , and that &apos;s what I said in _UNK_ .
So I bought a new _UNK_ in the town .
The pictures of the _UNK_ are a _UNK_ woman ,
And the posters of the _UNK_ are just a big balance .
And I was at the time when I was a girl ,
And I &apos;m more _UNK_ than any other girls .
And _UNK_ , when I knew my _UNK_ was a _UNK_ ,
and began to read my new _UNK_ ,
And I was surprised to find that it had been described completely .
And I realized that when I thought I was seven years old ,
I can &apos;t get seven years old ! In the beginning of God , I have a month
I have a whole month to do anything I want to do .
One day , two _UNK_ _UNK_ came to my door .
And I lived on the side of Los Angeles
And there &apos;s a block that &apos;s all over here .
and the people who come to the house
And sometimes the _UNK_ Church of Christ will come .
And then , some of the _UNK_ came in ,
They swear that if I _UNK_ to them ,
As these reasons , I didn &apos;t go to the _UNK_ , but I should have the door the day .
in a very short row of white shirts ,
that they are the formal representatives of the church .
They said they gave me the _UNK_ of God .
I said , &quot; Give me my _UNK_ ? &quot; They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
with a lot of people from Jesus Christ &apos;s late church .
But I never really know how they were .
or when they &apos;re talking about it , I think I &apos;m just curious .
and he said , &quot; Oh , they look very happy ,
And so I think it &apos;s a very _UNK_ for them .
I asked them to sit down and give them two glasses of water --
OK , I &apos;ve done it . I gave them two glasses of water .
You can &apos;t let me look at my reflection
Now , I let them sit down and give them two glasses of water ,
After finishing the basic _UNK_ , they said , &quot; Do you believe God is really loving you ? &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m sure God ,
But , you know ? I don &apos;t like the word &quot; heart , &quot;
I don &apos;t like that word , because God has sex .
But I don &apos;t want to argue with these boys ,
So I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry to say ,
And that &apos;s right ! And then they said ,
&quot; Do you believe that we all have brothers and sisters ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , I believe . &quot; I &apos;m happy .
It was a question that I could answer easily .
They said , &quot; We have a story to you . &quot;
And then I gave me a guy about _UNK_ ,
Every man is a bad guy . Everybody is evil .
God came to _UNK_ and said to him , &quot; _UNK_ your family .
I &apos;m going to take you out here . &quot; God really leads them
I said , &quot; The United States ? In _UNK_ , from Jerusalem to America ? &quot;
And then they told me _UNK_ and his descendants
and it &apos;s been passed by a generation of people
They divided into two _UNK_ : _UNK_ and _UNK_
every single person in _UNK_ is a good guy .
And every single person in the _UNK_ is very evil .
Every man has gone to the _UNK_ frame .
And then , in Jesus Christ , died of the crosses .
He paused on the way to _UNK_ in the United States
and tell them they &apos;re very good people .
So , in the war of evil , they will win .
and the _UNK_ finally killed all the _UNK_ .
because he was hidden in the woods ,
And he took the whole story of the story
I was sitting on the edge of the chair
And they said , &quot; They become the native American _UNK_ .
And I said , &quot; You know , we &apos;re all Americans .
the descendants of the evil frame ? They said , yes !
And then they told me I had a guy named Joseph
In his garden he found a hidden _UNK_
And he found a piece of magic , and he put magic into the hat .
And then he _UNK_ his face , and he went in .
and translated the text into the English language .
Now , I just wanted to give these two young people
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; Don &apos;t start telling people this story .
I mean , even if _UNK_ were starting to do a character test ,
and then tell people about _UNK_ , the most powerful thing in the Milky Way Galaxy .
And then they said , &quot; You believe God is _UNK_ to us ?
No , I don &apos;t believe that , I &apos;ll answer that .
because the whole story of _UNK_ had me angry .
and those crazy _UNK_ . But the fact is ,
I didn &apos;t know the whole story . So I said ,
What is the prophet ? They might be _UNK_ ?
And then they said , &quot; No . Why do I ask ? They said ,
because God has given a gift to a woman .
This gift is so beautiful , based on this , the only gift to men
So , I &apos;m thinking , what &apos;s the gift of God ?
Or do women live longer ? Or do women have no violence ?
But these are not gifts for women .
They said , &quot; The gift that women get is pregnant .
I said , &quot; Oh , yes . Even if women start to _UNK_
and every year , every child of life
They would have time to listen to the _UNK_ of God .
And they said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s not that .
Now , I don &apos;t think they &apos;re _UNK_ and lovely ,
And we believe that even if you &apos;re not _UNK_ ,
but still go to church and reputation , and after you die ,
You can still go into heaven and _UNK_ until your family _UNK_ .
This is not a very good motivation for me .
They continued to say , &quot; Well , we still believe
When you go to heaven , your body will be _UNK_ .
For example , if you have less legs , you &apos;re going to _UNK_ .
I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s why I lost the uterus
It wasn &apos;t that I was in the heaven ,
I would get my grandmother ? They were _UNK_ .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want him back , I &apos;m happy .
Oh , if someone has done the _UNK_ and likes the nose after surgery ?
God will force you to get your nose back to the original ?
And then they gave me a book of _UNK_ ,
and let me read this chapter , the chapter
and tell me they &apos;ll come back and see me again .
And I think my answer is , I don &apos;t worry about it .
Or directly , _UNK_ back . And then they left
And so , I started to think I was better than these two boys ,
and _UNK_ in my normal beliefs , but after a long time ,
The more I thought , the more I had to be honest
If someone went to _UNK_ , I thought my Catholic theory and _UNK_ .
And they would say , &quot; Well , you know ,
We believe that God makes a young girl
and make sure that the girl &apos;s _UNK_ is very important .
And this girl was born , and it was _UNK_ .
So I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to feel like the two boys .
But they asked me the question in _UNK_
I really believe that God is _UNK_ to me ?
I &apos;m not sure what I &apos;m going to feel about this .
Can I feel that God is in full love of me ?
it &apos;s going to be completely different . I think I &apos;ll have a _UNK_ response .
Yes , I always felt that I could feel my _UNK_ and _UNK_
This love makes me feel secure and safe .
When I was grateful , I could feel the beauty of the eyes of God .
But based on their problems that I believe
because I really don &apos;t know if I believe my feelings
is that most of our Indians have been learning .
And since then , it was 40 years ago --
I said , &quot; Did you end up ? This is my way of life ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to come back and do something that you &apos;re good at .
I think I &apos;ve fully controlled my life .
I want to get rid of it , health and happiness .
I need a _UNK_ to get me out of pain .
And then I announced to the world ,
I said that cancer is just a page of my life .
I &apos;m not going to let this page affect my rest of my life .
I wouldn &apos;t allow cancer to put me down .
A few _UNK_ are like climbing a mountain peak .
What about me is a dancer that can jump three hours ?
because of the pain and despair of the people
What I &apos;d like to do is to _UNK_ up weeping .
So I drag myself to my dance room
My body , thought , and soul , every day in my dance rooms ,
And that was from my four years old ,
Yes , cancer is just a page of my life .
to give us a sense of _UNK_ ,
I was armed with myself and I treated it .
I &apos;ve experienced the war with cancer , the war
I wish to be recognized , not as a cancer survivors .
I &apos;m going to show you a little dance
When I want to _UNK_ the information we use ,
when I was working with _UNK_ -- I invented the World Wide Web ,
I asked you to help create new architecture
I suggest that using a global _UNK_ system
But , 18 months later -- innovation is the beginning .
When I was 18 months later , the boss said that I could do it for a while .
and I was going to buy a computer
He gave me some time to write code ,
I should look at what the _UNK_ should look like .
I finished the code and put it out .
I felt _UNK_ -- because I was a software engineer
A lot of people come from around the world
They don &apos;t have the same kind of computer
If I want to build a little bit of something ,
And in these _UNK_ , the big computer
I &apos;m going to find some data , and I have to connect to new machines
to run some of the new programs
so that I can find some information in the new data format .
In fact , all of these _UNK_ are files .
Imagine some of the major virtual files in the air .
And so , once you have this idea ,
Even if people don &apos;t read your book ,
In fact , he read , because after he died , in his draft ,
He wrote &quot; _UNK_ in the corners , but he was excited . &quot;
But in general , it &apos;s hard to have that idea -- it &apos;s hard to explain
Now it &apos;s hard to explain people , not to mention
But , at the beginning of TED , there was no network
So , as you click on this thing is different .
We click a link , and then _UNK_ -- to another _UNK_ page .
We &apos;ve seen that the contents of the _UNK_
And the hard thing is to think about it
Well , this jump is hard to do
It &apos;s hard to explain , but it &apos;s a _UNK_ movement .
And this is where it &apos;s fun and fun .
It &apos;s not technology . It &apos;s not what people do with it .
but the actual communication , all of these people &apos;s ideas
You know , what &apos;s interesting is , now it &apos;s a little bit like that .
And I asked everyone , and they went out to document ,
I said , &quot; Can you put your documents on the Web ? &quot;
because we found that what happened on the Internet
Now I want you to put your data online
or it &apos;s a big way to release the potential
because the data we get from the Web is not what we want .
What &apos;s the data you say ? What &apos;s the difference between documents and data ?
And more , you &apos;ve read , you can track their link , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
data -- you can use all kinds of data
Who &apos;s here or else to hear Hans _UNK_ &apos;s talk ?
a great -- a lot of people have seen --
to use different colors to represent different countries .
At the same time , he showed the baby mortality
And he did this with this data , and he did a talk ,
And this talk broke a lot of people
And he showed a similar slide that he showed
We &apos;re looking at the data like this , isn &apos;t it ?
But in fact , the data drives us to live .
because some people use data and do something .
In this case , Hans put the data in a
Hans found all kinds of data and things in the U.S.
to make them more interesting than the original data .
&quot; Look , there &apos;s a lot of data that &apos;s very important . &quot;
I &apos;m glad to see the party yesterday evening ,
He still says , &quot; There &apos;s a lot of data that &apos;s important . &quot;
not only two data connected , or as he said ,
but anyone in the world has ever been
and put all the data and everything on the Web ,
This is the data that it &apos;s very simple .
If you want to put something on the Web , there are three rules ,
and the things that you describe to the document
And we have a lot of people and places
And the product , the event , and so on .
All the _UNK_ things are now named at the beginning .
The second rule , if I have a _UNK_ name , I look at it on the Web ,
I can get data from the Internet ,
I &apos;m going to get some standard _UNK_ data .
that may be useful about people who want to know
Who is the story ? All the information about this person
So the second rule is that I get the important data
The third rule is that I get the information
not only are people &apos;s height , weight and birth date .
This man was born in Berlin , Berlin was in Germany .
when the data is connected , when it does this ,
to the beginning of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
So , I can go directly to the _UNK_
For example , I looked at a guy -- I was born in _UNK_ ,
in this city , the town of the city
I gave it a year ago in a paper called &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
The idea of data is that we get a lot of
A lot of things began to _UNK_ up ,
And it brings us a lot of plants
And for every plant , whatever it is ,
One demonstration , an analysis , some people look at the pattern of data
You connect a lot of things , and the data is more valuable .
Soon , Chris _UNK_ from Berlin as a free college
as the first person to put things together
There &apos;s a lot of interesting documents about it .
In these documents , some small _UNK_ and _UNK_
He wrote a program to extract data from Wikipedia
and then you put it in the data ,
This slide in the middle of the 19th century ,
And if you go to Berlin in Berlin ,
you find that there &apos;s other data in the world
And there &apos;s Berlin , and they &apos;re connected to it .
So if you want to go from _UNK_ to Berlin ,
and you end up going to be able to do something else .
And the exciting thing is that it &apos;s growing .
The data actually comes from a lot of different forms .
Think about the diversity of the Internet , and it &apos;s important .
The Web allows you to put all kinds of data together .
and I can tell you all kinds of data
We can say that government data , the corporate data is really important .
about the conversation , and the news and all kinds of things .
I just mentioned a little bit of data
And you can see that it &apos;s diversity --
So you can see the potential of this
The U.S. government data will be applied on the Internet .
The U.S. government data will be applied in the Internet .
Not only for _UNK_ , _UNK_ is important to the government .
especially the data that came out of the government
Think about how much relationships are in the United States
I can use it in my family homework like a kid .
So what we &apos;re talking about is to make the world better .
In fact , if you &apos;re in charge -- if you know some data ,
Some people , they &apos;re going to be fascinated by these data .
You _UNK_ your database , you don &apos;t leave it .
I &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re not going to build a beautiful website
Well , now we have to ask the original data .
I &apos;m going to ask you to practice it , OK ?
And this exercise is really important to use
because you don &apos;t know people who have data ,
How many reasons you refuse to give it to you , even as a taxpayer ,
It &apos;s not just in the United States . It &apos;s all the same .
and not only in the government , but also in business .
I want to talk about other ideas about data .
In TED , we &apos;ve been focused on
that the human society now has a big problem
to understand the economy so that it can
the scientists who are trying to solve these problems
But the situation is that a lot of human knowledge
In fact , I &apos;m going to go from one aspect --
In the case of drug discovery -- there &apos;s a lot of data in this field .
_UNK_ data is a very good way to get rid of the island
because they have a genetic map in a database
They build a protein in another database ,
Now , they have the genetic map and the protein data
They could ask the question , maybe you wouldn &apos;t ask
When you put this problem in Google search ,
There is no answer to the truth of nature .
But there &apos;s no one you use -- now they &apos;ve been put
_UNK_ 32 , each outcome is related to the characteristics of proteins .
as a scientist , to ask those questions
because other scientists are collected , it &apos;s worth being locked .
We need to release the release so that we can deal with those _UNK_
Now , if I continue to say that ,
You just went to your social network site
One of your favorites , you say , &quot; This is my friend . &quot;
And you say , &quot; This is a picture of this guy . &quot;
every time you do something on the social network ,
the social network gets data and use it .
The purpose of re - design data is to make people more interesting
But when you go to another data website ,
And you say , &quot; I want to send this picture to all the people . &quot;
The economists have written an article about the problem and many people have _UNK_ .
The way to break the island is to achieve
And the last one I &apos;m going to talk about is probably the most exciting ,
And before I go to my house , I took a look at it ,
_UNK_ is a map , but also a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ this block , this is a theater -- where we are now --
The _UNK_ Theater , in _UNK_ , California . It &apos;s not now known as _UNK_ .
So I can go to the edit model , choose the theater ,
and then on the bottom , and save it .
You find this place , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s now name .
I &apos;m just going to go out of the map .
I put it there . Hey , you know , you know ?
And if everybody &apos;s labeled a little bit on this map ,
And this is the data that I &apos;m going to talk about .
to generate a little bit of content and connect them together .
Maybe your data is just a little bit smaller .
I can only tell you a little bit about it .
that every single aspect of our lives is
whether it &apos;s going to come from the source of data ,
And when you connect the data together ,
You can get energy in the network or document ,
you can get a big amount of energy
We have to do the stage -- those who think it &apos;s a great idea
And everyone -- I think most of the people in TED
They &apos;re not going to make the investment _UNK_ immediately .
because only when everyone has done it , it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ .
They &apos;re going to do that because they &apos;re the _UNK_ .
that people want to be involved in this kind of thing .
One of the _UNK_ themes is compassion , which makes me very touched .
We &apos;ve been listening to these mobile speeches :
And I want to talk about some ideas about compassion .
I &apos;m going to talk about the personal level of the world .
There was a very important study before ,
And in Princeton , the _UNK_ explained why
There are so many opportunities that we can go to _UNK_
from a student from Princeton _UNK_ in Princeton
was told that they were going to take a _UNK_
And half of the students get the theme
to help the story of the stranger &apos;s stranger .
They &apos;re _UNK_ to let them go to another building ,
in the way they went to the building ,
And each of them _UNK_ through a _UNK_ ,
Obviously this man needs help . The question is , do they stop and help ?
And the result is that there is no impact .
to decide whether or not it &apos;s going to stop .
is totally dependent on the _UNK_ of their _UNK_ .
They felt they were late , or they were _UNK_ .
And this , I think , is the _UNK_ of our life :
_UNK_ has a new field : social neuroscience
and a new idea of compassion from social science .
And that means that if we look at it ,
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ technology , in the brain ,
the same region in the brain . We are _UNK_ with each other .
If that man had to help , he was suffering ,
We are _UNK_ . At least this is the point .
The simple fact is that if we look at ourselves ,
If we are often more focused on ourselves all the time ,
And that gap between itself and its attention to others .
And one day I was tax , when I was going to
and I would like to list my _UNK_
I &apos;m going to write a cheque in the paper
When I gave the _UNK_ Foundation , I looked at my idea --
And so I realized that I was given
is self - _UNK_ -- I &apos;m satisfied with myself .
So I started thinking about people in the Himalayas
And I &apos;ve got this self to become
because of other people &apos;s _UNK_ . I think this is a power .
is that I encourage you to take care of it .
You can understand the situation in a particular date .
I went to a house in the early days
_UNK_ heard two women talking about a brother ,
And this woman said , &quot; Well , this woman said ,
So he &apos;s trying to play lightning . &quot; Do you know if you &apos;re playing lightning ?
and the women sat down and down and forth and forth ,
There &apos;s a clock and a clock , every five minutes , and every time ,
whether it &apos;s a card or an email address to this guy ,
&quot; My brother never got a card . I know why ?
Every time he sat , he began to stop talking about his situation ,
I did some surveys in the New York Times ,
to look at the stories behind the marriage ,
because they &apos;re going to be very interesting .
She will give each other a test of it .
And the test is : when they were together ,
And how long this guy would ask her ,
It was obvious that Mr. _UNK_ passed the test , so it had been reported .
This is a guy , a very small test ,
I encourage you to try and think about the party .
There &apos;s an article on Harvard Business _UNK_ recently .
And the question is , &quot; How do we tell
in the work of someone else . They call
The fundamental thing you &apos;re going to do is turn off the _UNK_ ,
There is a new vocabulary of English in English .
And the word is that the people who are talking to us suddenly _UNK_ out
or call calls , and then at once we don &apos;t exist .
This word is &quot; _UNK_ . &quot; This is &quot; _UNK_ &quot; and _UNK_ . &quot;
I think it &apos;s a very proper thing . It &apos;s our _UNK_ .
My sister _UNK_ is the expert of fear ,
And I think it &apos;s a little bit of influenced him .
Anyway , on the _UNK_ , my _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ decided to write a book about a continuous crime .
The man in the book brought a panic to our lives .
And he was the Santa _UNK_ . He was the _UNK_ .
He _UNK_ his _UNK_ before he was arrested ,
His mother and five girls at the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s not the most terrifying thing to feel .
The worst is his intelligence to 160 , a absolute genius .
But there is no relationship between IQ and emotion ,
So , on one hand , my sister _UNK_ up his courage .
and asked a question that he really wanted to know .
So , how can you do that ?
These are all very _UNK_ , and he _UNK_ them .
&quot; Oh , no . If I feel miserable , I won &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t have to think about it . I don &apos;t have to think about it . &quot;
And in a sense , in some sense ,
When there are other _UNK_ , we don &apos;t care about ourselves .
Imagine the scene of the shopping , and imagine
We have the potential consequences of buying and use objects .
We are all the victims of the common light .
We didn &apos;t notice , and we didn &apos;t notice that we didn &apos;t have any _UNK_ .
The toxic molecules that are _UNK_ or chairs .
Or we don &apos;t know that this fabric is a technology .
Or is it going to be _UNK_ ? In other words ,
In a sense , the room itself is &quot; _UNK_ &quot; , but it is ignored .
But we didn &apos;t see it . So we became victims
to lead the victims of the system . Think about it ,
The book is about the story of the _UNK_ .
This book is about the _UNK_ of cotton ,
and the use of fertilizer and its _UNK_
the consequences of the soil . This book is also mentioned , for example ,
The chance of living near the textile factory is high .
There is a company , _UNK_ and _UNK_ , the company supports _UNK_ website .
Victoria &apos;s secret -- because their chief CEO knows that ,
And they built a joint venture in China , and their _UNK_ plants
It can be _UNK_ before going to the underground water .
Now , we don &apos;t have the ability to choose this moral _UNK_ .
not to choose other products . How can it do that ?
There &apos;s a new electronic tag that allows any _UNK_
_UNK_ the complete history of any item on the shelf .
to track the production plant . Once you can track
And the factory , you can understand the process of production ,
and know if it &apos;s in a moral standard ,
can be tagged in _UNK_ . If it doesn &apos;t conform to moral standards ,
You can go to any of the shops ,
to put your _UNK_ on the _UNK_ ,
There are people who are sensitive to peanuts .
This website can tell you about the situation of the item .
and we can make a choice of compassion .
There is a kind of saying in information science :
But the question is , what is this ?
I was working in the New York Times ,
And that &apos;s what happened in the &apos; 80s , and I wrote an article
about the new issue of New York City --
I spent several weeks working with a social organization for _UNK_ .
And I realized that these homeless people
And most of them are the spiritual patient .
They can go . They have a diagnosis . That makes me .
from the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And when we went through a homeless day ,
a person in the edge of our eyes ,
One day after that , this is a Friday , after work ,
I &apos;m going to go to the subway station . The peak of work
The people in the world are _UNK_ out .
All of a sudden , when I was _UNK_ ,
I noticed that there was a guy who was _UNK_
There was no coat , _UNK_ , people _UNK_ from him .
because I &apos;ve got this kind of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I stopped to understand what was going on .
I just came up with this guy , a _UNK_ .
We found that he was Spanish , he didn &apos;t speak English ,
And he was walking around the street , _UNK_ ,
Some people got hot dogs and people brought the subway police .
What you need to do is just take care of it .
and it &apos;s been in the mind of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s like a puzzle that is being _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to let me tell you a clip
who are _UNK_ at the face of the friends
But our life is more abundant than memory .
And my responsibility is not to make him feel _UNK_ .
And the only purpose of her life is that
If we were caught , my sister and I ,
I don &apos;t remember the pirate for a few times ,
But I remember the light of the oil drill ;
from one of the men in _UNK_ .
The smell of the store seems to come from another world .
And the quiet voice said , &quot; I &apos;m going to go beyond you . &quot;
My job is to be sober , in her nightmare ,
and he was a very ruthless man ,
On the other hand , I _UNK_ the dangers of reality ,
When I was a kid who was a _UNK_ ,
I was chosen as a young woman in Australia .
and I was invited to talk to you ,
I want to go back to the original ,
And over the last 20 years of flat life ,
We &apos;ve been in a bed at three times .
She reminds me that she took us to go abroad ,
So I talked about unemployment and education issues
_UNK_ the edge group and _UNK_ the political rights .
to do what I like to do ,
I realized that I was not restricted to legal profession .
And here &apos;s another piece of puzzle that is _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to stand in a comfort zone right now .
Yes , the world started to break down ,
I got together a group of people
At the end of every day , I did a big soup .
And I thought I &apos;d move to the United States ,
the biggest _UNK_ of the local population .
and he took her husband to the court ,
&quot; It &apos;s not going to be possible . &quot;
And when she was in 600 miles away ,
to her that we &apos;ve been with her all the time .
He had to cover the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
&quot; Why is the hand of the grandmother ,
&quot; Because you &apos;ve been holding it from the morning , &quot; he said ,
to think about the shape of our lives ,
A man must _UNK_ us into us .
Now I want to go to my own children ,
to give them the oars of their lives ,
And at the same time , the _UNK_ _UNK_ came to the scene today ,
Richard _UNK_ : Thank you very much . The first _UNK_ of TED
_UNK_ : So , the wonderful thing about TED is that all of you are fun .
because I had to apologize to her .
I had the privilege of having dinner with her two years ago , but ...
She has a big wedding ring , and I &apos;ll try and get rid of it .
And I went home at night and saw my wife
She wanted to know why I had another woman in my hand .
Anyway , the next day we had to go there
I heard that this was started from a magazine called _UNK_ ,
And then what &apos;s going to happen today . What do you do ?
_UNK_ : I read the TED _UNK_ guide --
that you can &apos;t talk about yourself in business ,
If I answer , you should not take me back
_UNK_ : No , I mean , I learned that if you were a company
I mean , the key to the company is to find the right person .
to inspire them , to know that they &apos;re the best advantage
And I was glad to learn , and I was very _UNK_ .
You know , I love to know what &apos;s going on .
So life is a process of learning to me
You know , if I sat on the flight of other people ,
and it doesn &apos;t feel like a fish --
And before _UNK_ , I thought , maybe I could not .
to create a company that makes a _UNK_ airline
And then I bought a second hand , a _UNK_ ,
Your _UNK_ thought you were a _UNK_ in this act .
In fact , this action almost destroyed you and the mountains
And one time I was talking to a investment banker
At that time , you &apos;re basically selling _UNK_
And the bankers thought that the bankers had
It &apos;s only 25 airline companies , and you &apos;re sure that your brain &apos;s got a problem .
_UNK_ : Well , I think the success is only a line
And it &apos;s going to be a company that doesn &apos;t have a big deal of money .
and you might be able to be _UNK_
We were at the time when the British aviation
They wanted us to go out of business
They use it as &quot; Three _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
At the time , I realized that my empire could be _UNK_
to keep the staff of the _UNK_ _UNK_
and keep the record company &apos;s employee &apos;s rice bowl .
I had to do a lot of _UNK_
_UNK_ : After Napster , it &apos;s a time for online music .
_UNK_ : Yeah , it seems to be a wise person
But then it was sad , but we didn &apos;t have it in our pace .
_UNK_ : Now your _UNK_ brand is a wide range .
You can &apos;t benefit from the cooperation of all enterprises in your own business .
What is the value of the brand in your heart ?
_UNK_ : I think _UNK_ is the _UNK_ of quality .
You know , if someone _UNK_ saw a company , they would --
_UNK_ : _UNK_ is quality , Richard , good , good quality . Is the enterprise spirit ?
_UNK_ : No , I &apos;m going to talk about this right now .
We work fun in our work , and I think staff are quite _UNK_ .
We , like I said , you know , it &apos;s _UNK_ other industries .
And I think it &apos;s going to be a different way
And these are the ones that are starting to change .
_UNK_ : I mean , you &apos;ve got a company in _UNK_ --
and it &apos;s not a good thing to do ,
I had to miss a chance to _UNK_ -- you &apos;d call it a partner .
I mean , you don &apos;t want it to be _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ : That &apos;s the same thing that we can &apos;t be able to visit .
I mean , we &apos;ve always been talking about the customer when we first started opening .
But the _UNK_ company worked for three months
And then , I sat down and wrote a very long _UNK_ for the lady .
But obviously , I &apos;m not going to do anything .
It may be nine months later in the problem .
I received a very happy reply to a baby
_UNK_ : Really ? You should really take a picture . This is a great one .
_UNK_ : How do we get the _UNK_ down here ?
_UNK_ : Now I &apos;m going to give you a _UNK_
_UNK_ : You &apos;re going to show a lot of people
There was no idea that it would look _UNK_
_UNK_ : That &apos;s true . We started a supermarket in Los Angeles
_UNK_ : Well , that interesting thing is that --
_UNK_ : Oh , _UNK_ -- in fact -- we --
And that &apos;s not -- where can you stop for a few seconds ?
When I first came to the United States , I tried with _UNK_ ?
They , their rules and this is a little different .
_UNK_ : Yeah , my lawyer told me not to do that , but --
_UNK_ : And I said to you that --
We made a drink called the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ shape is kind of like _UNK_ Anderson ,
But the problem is that _UNK_ is always _UNK_ , but --
_UNK_ : We &apos;ve got a couple of pictures . _UNK_ &apos;s bride . It &apos;s nice .
OK , this one . I guess what &apos;s the prize ?
_UNK_ : 25 years ago we could launch _UNK_ _UNK_
&quot; _UNK_ , I don &apos;t know how to do that .
The Queen gave me a title for the next 25 years .
But she must be so _UNK_ , I think ,
_UNK_ : The Queen and you get a reward .
Do you like to be called Richard _UNK_ ?
In the United States there will be people like this ,
_UNK_ : Well , your title can give you any benefit , or just ...
_UNK_ : Well , this is not Richard _UNK_ , Richard _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : I &apos;m going to let my secretary adapt to it .
_UNK_ : Okay , let &apos;s look at the space development .
I think there &apos;s a video that tells us what you want to do .
_UNK_ : Yeah , it &apos;s 12 months later , it &apos;s ready to lift .
that people can travel too far to go .
_UNK_ : PR designed a part of the design , quite a part of it .
and the logo is his design , now he &apos;s shooting in New Mexico ,
The center of the launch is a _UNK_
you &apos;ll see a little bit of a look at you .
When you land , you &apos;ll go back to this giant eye ,
and he designed it , but it was a _UNK_
_UNK_ : But do you want him to design the engine ?
So I think he &apos;s not the best person to design the engine
_UNK_ : The Philip gave us a wonderful talk about two days ago .
_UNK_ : He &apos;s a _UNK_ , full passion , I appreciate him . But --
_UNK_ : So , you have the idea of _UNK_ exploration
I mean , the former air balloon , the boat , the _UNK_ people did it .
I went to the sea helicopter six times , so --
And every time you don &apos;t want to go home , you can talk about this experience .
you &apos;re going to think about what you &apos;re doing here --
_UNK_ : What is your most _UNK_ experience ?
You think it &apos;s _UNK_ ? I &apos;m going to be no longer .
_UNK_ : I think the balloon _UNK_ are all --
There was never anyone sitting in a hot balloon
I &apos;ve got to design a balloon that fits into speed
And when the balloon is driving in the air ,
It could be able to _UNK_ the air at an hour .
So , when the balloon _UNK_ off the Atlantic ,
is rising to the speed of speed , the big balloon --
And it turns out that the balloon is going to reach an hour
The space at the bottom is only about two times an hour
It &apos;s like a thousand horse in a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ the balloon , Fortunately , it wasn &apos;t .
But every time the balloon _UNK_ , you know --
And every time I was driving a balloon ,
And this is going to jump out of me ,
_UNK_ : That &apos;s going to make you a parachute parachute or a _UNK_ . &quot;
_UNK_ : No , he told me the parachute , but once he had a _UNK_ , he put the spaceship
and the balloon is going to be _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : You &apos;ve got a chance to give _UNK_ _UNK_ .
CA : Yeah , not , I put oxygen in the top of the balloon
On the back of the parachute , the bow looked at the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
I &apos;d like to _UNK_ my courage to jump into the _UNK_ Sea --
And that moment , Mrs. _UNK_ was really lonely .
_UNK_ : Did you jump , or the balloon landed at the end ?
_UNK_ : I knew that there was enough fuel
And I knew that if I had a _UNK_ ,
I can only live for more than a few minutes .
So I went back to _UNK_ and despair
to convince ourselves that this choice is correct .
I wrote a few slip out of my family , and I _UNK_ out .
and finally thought that there was a better way
You know , I have this big balloon on my head .
This is the largest parachute ever , why don &apos;t it waste ?
So I tried to go through the clouds and land
When I landed 50 feet above the sea , I jumped down .
And then I went back to the air for 10,000 feet , but I didn &apos;t have a balloon .
But it &apos;s a nice thing to see in the ocean --
_UNK_ : It &apos;s just what everyone &apos;s going to write in that situation .
I &apos;ve been writing to them before I leave .
_UNK_ : Your company &apos;s PR department , but it &apos;s a very important adventure .
These years -- until the last time I looked at the people
In Britain and abroad , you have a big hero
The _UNK_ guy would say you &apos;re just a very commercial brain .
what you &apos;re looking at in marketing is just doing ,
How many of the people in this audience ?
_UNK_ : Of course , the PR experts say that as a _UNK_
The hardest thing to do is to run into a balloon , what &apos;s going on .
_UNK_ : In fact , we bought a whole page of the magazine .
You are a big genius , right ?
_UNK_ : I had reading _UNK_ , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Maybe it was because I was 15 years old ,
If -- if I &apos;m not interested in anything , I &apos;m sure I can &apos;t learn anything .
I mean , like , I had to have to
I &apos;ve been running the largest private group in Europe
but I don &apos;t know the difference between net income and gross income .
So , this is a good thing to be bad ?
People say , oh , that &apos;s not a good thing .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ , gross profit , is gross profit , right ?
_UNK_ : I want to be a _UNK_
_UNK_ : One day , 50 years of my _UNK_ board
&quot; You see , Richard , let me explain to you --
to get the fish out of the sea
And the rest of this little network is your profit .
_UNK_ : But in school , when it was --
You can be the captain of the cricket and the football team .
So , you &apos;re the kind of natural leader ,
But there &apos;s a little bit like that -- you see yourself .
_UNK_ : I &apos;m a little bit like that , but I --
And so I can also be in some ways
_UNK_ : You have a lot of strange experiences in your youth .
She was said that she had only four - year - old you left the field and said , &quot; Go home . &quot;
She thought that we should have been living on our feet
So she would do that today , she was sent to the police station
to get ourselves to the way to the grandmother .
and she let us go to a very remote place .
She never let us see what television is .
And there &apos;s a family in the studio that has kids .
It &apos;s a _UNK_ to bring kids into adults .
And you think that the kids are now
It was not too early to be , and there was no _UNK_ .
This generation will not be able to fly into a _UNK_ --
_UNK_ : No , I don &apos;t think people are developing children
is to _UNK_ them and praise and _UNK_ .
I think it &apos;s better to be too _UNK_ to children .
_UNK_ : Well , you grow well , I think --
I mean he feels that you don &apos;t have a _UNK_ in school .
He said , you &apos;re either a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ : I did it , but I was in prison .
I am the oldest two laws in Britain .
I was _UNK_ by the _UNK_ Act .
The first was because I was in the public
It was in the middle of a young aid
There &apos;s a question of teenagers who are _UNK_ .
_UNK_ to oral or written _UNK_ in the public .
So , the police _UNK_ and told me I was arrested .
If I were to mention the _UNK_ again ,
So , we had the crown of our _UNK_
And after that , we came up with _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The police thought , &quot; _UNK_ , so I went to prison again .
because the album is the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
He asked me if I could find a language ,
to give you a sense of what it means .
I want to talk to you about _UNK_
And the professor said , &quot; Well , the _UNK_ doesn &apos;t mean ,
It was only 18 people to the _UNK_ . &quot;
I asked , &quot; Can you come to court for me ? &quot;
He said he was happy . I said --
No , he said , &quot; Do I need a _UNK_ ? &quot;
_UNK_ : So the key witness that we have --
And the judge then _UNK_ -- a very _UNK_ decision .
a lot of people are going to be
a single _UNK_ can &apos;t deal with this vast group .
someone wrote a biography of your _UNK_ .
Is it true ? Is there any real elements in the book ?
the people who are _UNK_ to the goal
people will come back and come back again .
And I think life is a _UNK_ _UNK_
to do a _UNK_ and a _UNK_ businessman
And I &apos;m going to run a _UNK_ group
_UNK_ : What about those who love you ?
Do they look at your new project being _UNK_ ?
It &apos;s very addictive to you to the creative world .
Every time you start a new plan ?
_UNK_ : I also think the Father is an important thing .
And when I was a kid who was a long time ,
When they go out of holiday , I &apos;m going to go with them .
We &apos;ve been with three months of happy holidays .
Yeah , I &apos;m going to know , keep in touch . We &apos;re lucky .
We have a _UNK_ in the Caribbean ; we can --
I would take them where I had friends
And I can also update information in real time .
_UNK_ : capitalism is proven to be an effective economic system .
and the wealth is focused on a few people
So the minority is in charge . I think , with this wealth ,
to those lucky people , to avoid each other ,
who looks at the _UNK_ , who is the _UNK_ ,
But you know , that money can create more jobs
_UNK_ : What you most care about , the most worried about
_UNK_ : So this is -- a lot of problems
The global warming is a big problem for human survival .
And we are trying to solve the problem
Or , we &apos;re going to launch a prize , a real prize .
to prevent us from being able to replace energy
to prevent us from being able to control greenhouse gases .
It &apos;s not going to be a _UNK_ problem .
We have to encourage you to change the way .
We &apos;ve got to -- you know , isn &apos;t it ?
to do it , so we want people to try --
the best brain in the world , the _UNK_ ,
We &apos;re going to have about 10 million people .
We need only one solution , and it &apos;s also very hopeful .
_UNK_ : And you have a couple of plans in Africa ?
_UNK_ : Yes , we &apos;re going to start a call --
The war room is like the name is not so good .
We tried to -- maybe the name -- whatever --
The plan to deal with all the _UNK_ of Africa
and she took the _UNK_ drug 24 weeks ,
and the baby is not going to be infected with HIV .
_UNK_ : The war room , the name is very powerful .
As a hero on the Western mall , it won &apos;t have risk .
And so exciting -- I mean , as a businessman , used to take the idea
to be able to do the best of the world
And so , in Africa , there &apos;s no risk in Africa .
We can solve this problem , we can do that .
We have all these things that we have ,
And I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to solve complex problems . &quot;
but it was a mess . Do you worry about it ?
_UNK_ : First of all , this problem , we actually --
_UNK_ was a little bit harder to accept
But it &apos;s also a solution to AIDS , I think that &apos;s a solution .
And he was trying to solve this problem , and he accused of having a lot of _UNK_ .
This is a way to work with him ,
It &apos;s going to help people get themselves to Africa .
not just replace it for a few years .
But I think business leaders can be _UNK_
And we also tried to make these _UNK_
_UNK_ : A lot of people say , you know , you know ,
but it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s basically being _UNK_
And the _UNK_ is , you raise your personal image ,
is to avoid _UNK_ , not as _UNK_ instincts .
And there &apos;s a lot of activity behind everybody &apos;s behavior .
I think that when I &apos;m in the middle of my house ,
I can feel that I can contribute to the world
And it might be a bit selfish .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ said that , and I agree with
But I &apos;m not expert , he said , &quot; Over 30 , 40 years ,
will be very keen to grow , and this will be satisfied .
to 50 and 60 , people are ready to get intelligent .
What do you want to contribute to yourself ?
_UNK_ : I don &apos;t think what &apos;s going to happen
And I thought , well , my grandmother had been alive to _UNK_
So , I &apos;ve got 30 , 30 , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six .
No , I just want to use life .
I want to do something for the world .
And one of the things that I think is good
For example , Google &apos;s _UNK_ and Larry _UNK_
really care about the world and use their wealth to do the world ,
If there &apos;s the same wealth , it doesn &apos;t care about two people in the world ,
And so , the whole world can be _UNK_ .
is that it &apos;s very important to have
_UNK_ : Richard , when I first started in the bank ,
I don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m not sure --
I think the business people in business should be vicious .
There &apos;s only such a way that you can stand up and succeed
You give me a lot today . Look at you , I think ,
And he did that , maybe there was another way to succeed
So , thank you for the inspiration to us today
And as I walked out of the classroom ,
I &apos;ll laugh at my mouth , &quot; I must pass , please rest assured me . &quot;
On the other hand , when you are _UNK_ , they are not satisfied .
and you can &apos;t find yourself in a position .
So I said to myself , &quot; No , no , no , no .
What God came to me in a way .
For example , I began to give me some advice on the painting .
And so I was able to survive ,
and found themselves in the school where they were .
I won a little _UNK_ transistor radio in _UNK_ .
And on the train , I _UNK_ the volume .
And then , at that time -- I was going to go to _UNK_
And he said , &quot; How much does this radio buy ? &quot;
I said , &quot; But this is the prize for drawing a game . &quot;
He said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to paint it in college .
No matter who &apos;s sitting next to you , may change your life . It &apos;s possible .
Just as long as we think about it , we have potential .
to do what I really want to do ,
And my mind came up with a trajectory ,
It may be a pile of debris , maybe a _UNK_ ,
or stay in the ink or in any way ,
But these are all the time of the fingerprints .
Now I want to show you some of these works .
It was a mark of the _UNK_ in this body .
And the body is really enjoying the mold ,
and close to self , to the sense of self .
So , this is what I call the mold .
The freedom of the hand of the freedom .
because he &apos;s a _UNK_ , and it &apos;s going to flow easily ,
After 20 minutes , he was _UNK_ as a _UNK_ .
This is the catch of the fingerprints ,
No matter what we do , we always leave the mark .
It &apos;s not , a object moves , meets another object , leaving marks ,
He just showed what was on the other side .
So I put the paper on the distance ,
And then I got a portrait of the Sun .
And what I did is I put 10 feet of paper
and it took 24 hours to make it .
When you go to understanding , your role is also important .
How many of you have seen the Indian bull crossing the street ,
she would say , &quot; To go to the other side . &quot;
When the cow _UNK_ through the road , you know .
If the answer is not the same , the answer is not the same .
I have a dream that all cows get free .
And then it was inspired , _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
He would say , &quot; It &apos;s cows crossing the street ,
If he saw the same cow , he would say ,
&quot; Ask this question to _UNK_ your own cows . &quot;
and most of the time we can &apos;t see the nature of things .
We &apos;re going to look at this little piece of paper .
We don &apos;t have any meaning in this world .
But if you tear it away from the middle .
Well , he &apos;s called &quot; light _UNK_ &quot; --
So the table is not only creating light , but also creating darkness .
So this is a piece of art that attempts to explore the subject .
And he showed us the _UNK_ of our hearing --
But it seems that he was going to get out of the wall .
This is the first skin , the second layer ,
The third layer , every layer has a meaning .
We just _UNK_ the wall out of the whole gallery .
When I was doing it , I always suspect myself working with _UNK_ --
Now , when I ask questions about consciousness --
No matter when I see a bird in the _UNK_ ,
What do they have ? They have no marks ? Is there any _UNK_ ?
And I finally thought about it , and I thought ,
This is the creation of my material .
It &apos;s a very interesting process to do the sculpture .
_UNK_ said , &quot; dear sir , I &apos;m an artist , this is my resume .
And I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll go to some little _UNK_
So I told them , &quot; I want to open a _UNK_ company . &quot;
and then you &apos;ll add the details to you . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to open a company , just to do my own work .
And this is the foundation of Delhi .
In India , no one really cares about art .
In fact , they don &apos;t have a couple of dollars .
So if somebody says , &quot; Oh , I look at that portrait . &quot;
A few months later he may not be _UNK_ .
in the air of the same gallery or museum .
&quot; Why are you always _UNK_ around these strange subjects ? &quot;
Do you think there &apos;s a little bit about death ? &quot; They said .
But she said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t like him .
Or we can break the sculpture into the soil ,
but we can &apos;t create the dirt . &quot;
The air _UNK_ through the sculpture and produced another crack .
We don &apos;t see the shadow , we don &apos;t see the light ,
What we see is their reflection , rather than their own existence .
You know , this is why , night . We see the black day ,
When they reflect on the surface of the moon , we see him .
The small dust will also reflect the light ,
We can &apos;t see the dark , and we can &apos;t see the light ,
because in the art of _UNK_ , I saw this , and I saw that --
If we _UNK_ the bird , he has two _UNK_ .
The skin on the other side represents the ground .
This is a _UNK_ box and his shadow .
you can &apos;t see anything that &apos;s invisible to you ,
It has the properties of all objects that can be seen .
And then again , on that point , there &apos;s no shadow .
It &apos;s called a broad scale . He &apos;s on the gallery .
This is a show from the _UNK_ gallery ,
If the air is _UNK_ , I can feel him .
to the other side of the wall , the logic ,
Because we saw somebody walking , we saw the _UNK_ .
But if we just _UNK_ the _UNK_ and tried to analyze it ,
and a whole new material of a telephone line .
A lot of people _UNK_ the city means that this new discovery of industry
These products came from the end of the _UNK_
In the &apos; 90s , I was interested in the art form of change
I got the opportunity to work with people in this community
and in the product scale and design to guide them
This project started in the beginning of the year ,
and we &apos;re going to have more than this piece of _UNK_
So we connected a wire maker to help us
It &apos;s not only about the material on the thread ,
And here &apos;s a product that can produce some modern products .
rather than the one that was once a single product .
And so I &apos;ve expanded the product category
It &apos;s obvious that they are suitable for a higher _UNK_ market .
and can be used to export and serve our local market .
And then we did a series of experiments , as you see ,
This project has been 12 years ago , and we provided goods for _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s _UNK_ , and it &apos;s nice to see it .
And this is a group of our core _UNK_ .
They all came to the first rural area
This is a community that I &apos;m starting to show you .
This passion is a wonderful teacher to me
because it can teach us a lot about the world around us .
I &apos;m going to spend a few minutes to believe
We &apos;re going to start with some simple , Newton &apos;s second law :
We can get the acceleration of the _UNK_ quality ,
The greater quality of a larger particle , the greater the mass ,
The bigger the size of the brand , the bigger the _UNK_ ,
It takes more power to change its position .
So the physics is that the greater mass of an object
to measure the state of a particle , like , location ,
Because according to definition , the action is changing the particle .
So to explain it -- if there &apos;s a fundamental particle ,
So you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s in front of you .
by looking at consumers and change their behavior .
They talk about their brilliant kids in a focus group ,
and almost no one could buy a lot of junk .
So far , McDonald &apos;s sell thousands of _UNK_ a year .
Think about people who are _UNK_ in the supermarket
And if you want to think about it ,
So far , we know Google is the first person to search pages .
marketing is the information that the marketing of marketing is ,
_UNK_ , you can collect the _UNK_ of _UNK_
This will _UNK_ the hypothesis but it will not eventually prove it .
There &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ that can support his theory .
You can invest in a brand for a long time ,
It turns out that yourself is a brand for environmental _UNK_ ,
whatever you &apos;re going to invest in your brand ,
The _UNK_ of the week can _UNK_ the good achievements of decades .
So it &apos;s going to be very careful to avoid a mess .
And finally , let &apos;s say a little bit more _UNK_ world ,
is a way to measure the disorder of the system ,
a market marketing manager can control a message
and then show it , like the _UNK_ ,
Because even though every consumer can enjoy it .
I did see him speak . He did a good job .
The distribution of energy is a democracy ,
The scale will always be strengthened ; this is a fundamental law .
The message from marketing is that your brand has become weak .
The physics can teach all of us , even in marketing , some useful things .
I &apos;ll come to you , what is the French language of this instrument ?
I think you should all be the history of _UNK_ .
The show on the screen is a _UNK_ of different types or shapes .
and the strings are going to play songs ,
It _UNK_ with a wooden box like a piano _UNK_ .
It can start _UNK_ or is called &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
When I turn the handle and the pressure ,
there was an instrument that had been there in the last thousand years ,
And the other one was _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
And then a few centuries later , the _UNK_ changed ,
And in the middle of the _UNK_ , the _UNK_
In today &apos;s life , _UNK_ can be used for all kinds of music ,
a piece of yarn needs a _UNK_ to use
How many words do you say that you are _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ : I don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t want to think about it ?
because it was the place that I lived ,
The piece is a beauty of the _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to talk about two big trends today .
But I want to start with the story of love
I and my colleagues were _UNK_ to 32 people
who have 17 people who have _UNK_ sex ,
And the other 15 people have just been _UNK_
So I want to talk about this experiment
and then I understand the love of love .
I think our ancestors are confused about this problem .
and they sat down on the _UNK_ side a million years ago ,
to find the meaning of romantic love ,
I went through the research of psychology for 45 years .
and found that when people fall into love ,
And the first thing that happened was that
And the other person starts to be _UNK_ .
My world has a new center , which is Mary _UNK_ .
He said that the love of one woman and another woman
although you can also ask you not to enjoy him .
But take care of the _UNK_ , and then try to love it .
I decided to read poetry from all over the world .
Now I want to read you a poem in the _UNK_ century ,
because it was almost perfect to show how a man was committed to a woman .
It &apos;s like when a _UNK_ fell in love with someone ,
He would feel that this man &apos;s car was not the same as any other car .
And the dinner party was also as _UNK_ as any other _UNK_ .
In this story , a man got a _UNK_
And this poem was written by a poet _UNK_ :
The _UNK_ was _UNK_ and had not been _UNK_ .
remember the beginning of the day , looking at the _UNK_ ,
and maybe I &apos;m going to be like you ,
But no matter what it means to you , not only that person is special to you .
like a _UNK_ saying , &quot; I think it &apos;s going to fly into the air . &quot;
When things go well , you &apos;re going to feel happy .
When things don &apos;t work well , you &apos;ll be in an extremely disappointing and panic .
Like a New York businessman said to me , &quot; She likes everything I love . &quot;
You know , if you just go to bed with someone ,
You don &apos;t care if she &apos;s going to go to bed with someone else .
And I think this is the evolution of evolution .
because love has made two people tightly tightly _UNK_ ,
The relationship is strong enough to get two people together .
But the most important feature of love is _UNK_ .
For one person , not only _UNK_ , but also _UNK_ desire .
And of course , she was a very good bed ,
But you look forward to him / she &apos;ll call you , about you , and so on .
You can &apos;t wait until you start to act , you can &apos;t get this guy .
And the final feature of love is _UNK_ .
When I let them go into an MRI machine ,
But the most important question is always a
&quot; How many times are you in the day ? &quot;
They would say , &quot; All night . They never miss it . &quot;
And then I would ask them the last question ,
I always try to get them to answer the question .
I can &apos;t cure the wound of people &apos;s minds .
&quot; Are you going to die for this man ? &quot;
It &apos;s like I asked them to give me the salt .
I asked them to look at a picture of love ,
We will find that the same brain has the most powerful activity
We also found that there was a lot of brain areas
And in fact , the brain region that we focused on
is the brain that makes you feel excited about cocaine .
I began to realize romantic love is not just a mood .
I thought love was a series of emotions
But in fact , love is a drive from the _UNK_ power .
from our inner desires , a strong wish ,
And this is the power of the power ,
like you want to get a promotion in your work .
I think this power is more powerful than _UNK_ .
When you ask someone to go to bed with you , if this man said , &quot; No . &quot;
You &apos;re not sure that this suicide or a depression
But in the world , if people refuse to do that ,
people live for love , killing for love , die for love .
They make songs for love , poetry , fiction , sculpture , pictures , _UNK_ , stories and legend .
In more than 200 million societies , people use different evidence that the brain is so powerful
to get people to the point of view
I think it &apos;s from the initial mating and reproduction .
to develop the most basic three different brain organizations .
One of them is sexual : a longing for sexual beings .
It &apos;s always _UNK_ you , it &apos;s like hunger .
And the second is the romantic love :
It was a quiet and safe way from prolonged partner .
I think it &apos;s a desire to _UNK_ you
You know , you can feel it when you drive it .
and romantic love will make you focus on
And the third brain system is dependent on
It &apos;s going to make you feel good for him .
This kind of _UNK_ allows you to raise the baby &apos;s time .
After opening , I should discuss two most prominent social trends .
One of the things that was built before _UNK_ ,
These two trends are _UNK_ , love , and dependent
These three different brain systems have been influenced .
The first stage is that women start working and become part of labor .
I &apos;m talking about _UNK_ percent of the world &apos;s population report
and found that women in 130 countries were entering labor markets
The process may be slow , but the trend is definitely _UNK_ .
between men and women and women --
There is always a resistance to every trend on the planet .
&quot; The dog will be _UNK_ , but the fleet are moving forward . &quot;
I _UNK_ back because the women are not fresh to work .
in the land of Africa for millions of years ,
And they took a dinner with _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
At the same time , women also have the same economic ability , social ability and option .
In short of all , we &apos;re going to go back
As the _UNK_ began , the role of men became _UNK_ .
But as the industrial revolution and the industrial revolution ,
In short , they &apos;re getting a social position and identity
What we &apos;re seeing now is one of the most important traditions in human history .
In general , my whole speech can be influenced by women in the economy ,
I &apos;ll just give some of these things , and I &apos;ll talk about love and sex .
Those who think men and women are certain to have sons and daughters at the same time .
I don &apos;t know why they think men and women are the same .
Men and women have a lot of different places , but
And it &apos;s just like a _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
&quot; We &apos;re going to move on with each other , &quot; we &apos;re going to move on . &quot;
But our brain has not evolved into the same structure .
And now it &apos;s getting more and more differences
I &apos;m just talking about it , and I &apos;m going to go into _UNK_ love .
One is the language of women . Women are talking to _UNK_ .
Women can quickly find the right words , the most clear thing
This ability to increase the height of the female hormones in the middle of the _UNK_ cycle .
But when _UNK_ were in _UNK_ , they had better performance than ordinary men .
They used to be so many years ago , language was their tool .
and they face up with their _UNK_ kids ,
more slowly countries like India and Japan ,
I think television is like a global _UNK_ party .
We _UNK_ it , and it &apos;s influenced our ideas .
And when I make a show , I &apos;m going to talk about the subject .
and the producer is almost all about women .
&quot; Have a great writer like having another government . &quot;
Now the writers in the United States are women .
This is just one of the many features of women .
The brain route that imagination and the long-term plan
because the female brain is much more connected .
when they think about it , they can collect more data
a group of more complex forms , seeing more choices and results .
They can do a _UNK_ , _UNK_ thought , called the Internet ,
And the men would _UNK_ out what they thought was _UNK_ .
just focus on what they &apos;re doing , thinking ways to _UNK_
In fact , in this world , male genius and _UNK_
But the _UNK_ in the world is also the male _UNK_ .
when the male &apos;s brain works well , it can be very good .
I think we &apos;re trying to build a social society
a society that _UNK_ men and women &apos;s talents
In fact , women go into the labor market
I &apos;m always amazed that every time people ask me ,
And I said , &quot; How do you think that male _UNK_ ? &quot;
I asked them , &quot; What are these men going to bed ? &quot;
and it &apos;s not going to be blamed for its own _UNK_ .
They get married , and children are less likely to find better marriage .
Women have more _UNK_ and _UNK_ about it .
And indeed , we &apos;ve been talking about it again .
back to the _UNK_ of Africa a million years ago .
because this is the way that hunting and _UNK_
We are _UNK_ the age of the old age of marriage .
that marriage can be called a _UNK_ marriage .
and back to the form of human spirit .
_UNK_ women and men in the United States
is not going to be married because of each other &apos;s own quality .
If he had no love with each other ,
in 37 countries , people around the world
just want to marry the people they love .
Indeed , marriage has begun to fade off the stage of history .
I think that marriage should be more stable .
The first is that women go into the labor market
in the age of 85 to be called
Because , in the age of 85 to 85 ,
40 percent of people &apos;s health is no problem .
So , we see the extension of the middle class
I have a book of 58 countries in my own book .
You can see that as old age increases , the _UNK_ also decreases
So the United States now is a stable one .
And as _UNK_ , the female hormone update , the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Women have never been so attractive as they are now .
There is no _UNK_ or _UNK_ in which women are so _UNK_ today .
So I &apos;m very sure that in the history of human evolution
The best time to create perfect marriage is that now !
_UNK_ , romantic love and dependent on these three brains .
you &apos;re going to fall in love with those who are just _UNK_
At the same time , the body also produces _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re related to other people , you &apos;re going to feel
But the three emotional systems that we have
You &apos;ve got a very deep _UNK_ dependent and responsibility
and you have a strong love for another person .
and you might have sex for the third person .
In a simple way , we can love a lot of people at the same time .
In fact , when we lie in bed at night ,
we can think about the _UNK_ of someone
and feeling a romantic love with someone .
In your mind , like a group of people
because you need to make a choice
So I think humans are not a species that are created to enjoy happiness .
We are a species that are created to reproduce .
We can build a good relationship with everyone .
I have a worry , and a wonderful story
the United States will have over 100 million _UNK_ .
I know a girl starts taking _UNK_ from her 13 .
She was 23 years old , and she started taking this drug
I &apos;m not opposed to those who are in the short term because
who want to commit suicide or killing people
But more and more Americans begin to take depression
The effect of these drugs is to improve the content of _UNK_ .
With the rise of _UNK_ , the _UNK_ cycle
_UNK_ not only _UNK_ the _UNK_ , but also _UNK_ sex .
When you fall in your sexual excitement , you lose _UNK_ .
Once you lose _UNK_ , those hormones that you produce are _UNK_ .
I just want to say a world without love
I want to end with a story , and then I &apos;m going to say ,
I &apos;ve been studying love and _UNK_ for 30 years .
I am twins , and I &apos;m interested in why we are so alike .
Why are you and I like , why are the Japanese ,
The people in Australia , and the Amazon _UNK_ are like that .
About a year ago , a network _UNK_ came to me
I want to design a new date site for them .
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know anything about personality , you know ? &quot;
I &apos;m not sure if you &apos;re looking for somebody
And that makes me think , why do you fall in love with someone else ,
This is the subject I &apos;m studying now , and I &apos;m going to book the next book .
You fall in love with someone else for all reasons .
_UNK_ is important . You may fall in love with someone .
because the _UNK_ can make your brain go up .
to get you across the gate and fall in love .
You love people who are just in love with you .
He _UNK_ the list of your childhood _UNK_
the people who are _UNK_ with you ,
But I want to tell you a story about this .
What I &apos;m talking about here is the physical basis of love .
I want to tell you something about culture .
This is a story that I heard from other people .
is about a graduate student , I &apos;m a _UNK_ , my two colleagues
is where we did MRI scans for people
This graduate student is in love with another graduate student .
And then they went to a conference in Beijing
He knows that if you do something very fresh with someone ,
can make the difference in the human brain .
and it &apos;s likely to be romantic and romantic .
So he sat around with this girl
I &apos;ve never done a _UNK_ in my own life .
They &apos;re moving between the bus and the truck
very crazy , very noisy and very exciting .
The boys think that this increases the _UNK_ of the girl &apos;s brain .
In _UNK_ , the girl was excited about the _UNK_ ,
And then they went down to the _UNK_ ,
The girl raised her hands and asked , &quot; It was too exciting . &quot;
In the end , I &apos;m going to say , three human brains have developed
_UNK_ , love and long-term partner depend on
These _UNK_ systems are deep in the human brain .
They &apos;re going to live with the humans for a long time .
is that it &apos;s both human and personal choices .
How do you sell more of the car
If what we do is just selling more cars
And over time , twice as much as the _UNK_ ,
I actually grew up in Ford _UNK_ ,
and I was a little bit more _UNK_
When his father _UNK_ Ford or _UNK_ came home , he stopped on the road .
When I was 10 years old , I decided to make a decision
If I could be a test driver , it would be _UNK_ .
When they sat down , I _UNK_ out and went out .
jump on the _UNK_ , opening the new car to the road ,
until I was about 12 years old --
I &apos;d like to turn a few circles in the snow .
At the same time , my car hit a _UNK_
The front door , he was hit by a _UNK_ .
This experience allows me to _UNK_ my life
My first car was a _UNK_ of electricity .
It actually took me the _UNK_ of my car .
The car is not just what I love .
and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more
and believe that the mission of Ford _UNK_
to get everyone to buy a car .
I went to the north of _UNK_
_UNK_ fishing for the fish in _UNK_ ,
And I went to my favorite _UNK_ ,
and now it becomes a mall or a _UNK_ .
And I was in my heart , in my heart ,
At the beginning of the university , you can imagine what I was ,
They think we focus on whether we make money .
is that we let the sky smoke out .
to do some of the ideas that are fighting .
and I thought about 30 years ago ,
And it was thought that I had this ability
I never forget that day I was sent to the office
And of course , I don &apos;t care about it .
I mean , I think most of the industry
all understood that we had to take action .
The good news is that we are trying to solve
Not only Ford , the whole industry is so _UNK_ .
We &apos;re reducing -- I believe , someday , we can _UNK_ --
And we started selling electric cars , and this is _UNK_ .
In fact , despite the fact that our work
I can still see the two things I &apos;m passionate about --
even though we &apos;re dealing with this big problem --
And as I say , we have a long _UNK_
And even though we &apos;re working on it ,
as the environment is threatened by the threat
The global population is about _UNK_ billion people
In our lifetime , this number will rise
that our planet is going to face the limit of development .
If we connect the population to the car ,
There are about 400 million cars around the world
This is going to grow up to two billion dollars .
And this is going to take the _UNK_
It &apos;s going to have a little impact on our daily lives .
This waste a lot of time and resources
Last summer -- many of you can see this news --
You can see how many of the problems we face .
and we see the pattern that we have today
I think you may have a number of _UNK_
The traffic _UNK_ is just a symptom of this challenge .
Our quality of life will be _UNK_ by a large discount .
And the answer is that the answer is that
&quot; If I asked people what they wanted to do ,
In World War II , to connect the country
to make sure that the future of personal actions is sustainable .
And it &apos;s worth that , it &apos;s going to work in different parts of the world .
And on the ground is a series of pavement
_UNK_ and special channel will be built .
And this is going to take the New York City
They have an interesting system called &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
is going to be what &apos;s going to happen .
And very quickly , what we &apos;re using today
to drive 30 miles to my office in _UNK_
But very quickly , we can see that
If a car in front of me met a traffic jam
so I can find the best way to go home .
They &apos;re soon going to be run by the official .
You can go through the center of the city
and your car will be connected to a smart parking system .
You &apos;ve got a parking space before you arrive --
to drive a parking space for a moment .
with an intelligence call to a _UNK_ ,
so you don &apos;t have to wait for the _UNK_ .
to choose your best way to go home .
And you can get to the next destination ,
And it was obvious that we &apos;ve got to do it .
but we &apos;re dealing with carbon dioxide emissions .
Use more cars , build more roads or new rail systems ;
and we would like to be able to
or other ways we don &apos;t think about it .
And I felt that I was very surprised
We need to be in the same passion and energy
We need people like you in this room
And we need people all over the world
to think about how they respond to this challenge .
It needs a national level of energy policy .
because the solution of every country is going to be
But we need to take action , and we &apos;re going to do it today .
spend a lifetime crossing over 25 miles of distance
And what do we want to go to ?
We don &apos;t want to go back and lose the freedom .
I told you that I knew we had the burden --
what we &apos;re looking at is the big problem
and all the way to do it ,
to help solve the problem of global traffic
we can make sure that we are accustomed to
And if we deal with this problem ,
in the country , the world &apos;s free access
And this is a really _UNK_ problem .
that we &apos;ve been able to do in recent years
And one of the things that you know is that
to _UNK_ the needs of the Big Bang --
&quot; Great &quot; is the organization , the system , the state --
and the needs of &quot; small &quot; -- those individuals , individuals .
and how we can relate to each other .
It &apos;s going to be necessary to take consumers ,
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
So , by _UNK_ the little &quot; to build &quot; big , &quot;
And I think this is our belief -- my belief ,
And in a sense , we &apos;re going to do it ,
And especially for the British audience , I call the first chapter --
And you can &apos;t see it . I think , a lot of times ,
What we do is we take a mirror to the customer , and say ,
And it &apos;s not a matter of _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to give you an example of this .
a very large medical insurance agency has ever found us .
Let &apos;s describe the experiences of their patients .
And what I thought was that the _UNK_ organization
hundreds of bubbles and what the system is ,
Or worse , the people who are _UNK_
It &apos;s full of _UNK_ charts , all kinds of _UNK_ .
And in fact , the first thing we share with them is this :
I think it &apos;s going to happen . It &apos;s going to happen .
The key is that when you lie in the bed of the hospital ,
What you can do is do the ceiling , and it &apos;s really awful .
You need to put yourself in a patient &apos;s perspective .
This is _UNK_ , and we are working on _UNK_ .
and look at the ceiling of the _UNK_
The feeling of the patient in the hospital is like this .
And they had a little bit of a blind look .
to try and look at the situation --
instead of looking at it in the traditional tissue --
And that was also a catalyst for them .
It &apos;s not a ridiculous project to do it .
but it &apos;s going to make a lot of different things .
So we &apos;ve done some little details from them .
the small details that are going to affect .
First of all , we got a little _UNK_ ,
and put it on the _UNK_ of the hospital
And so when you get a nurse or a doctor running around ,
And you can see them in your mirror ,
This is a little example of what they do .
And the interesting thing is that _UNK_ can &apos;t wait for action --
Well , we _UNK_ this idea . What can we do ?
The first thing they did was to _UNK_ the ceiling .
I think that &apos;s great . I &apos;ve got this _UNK_ recently ,
My mom now estimated that I was building the room .
And even though the best design in the world .
for example , the floor of the _UNK_ ward
to show that this is my room . This is my private space --
is a very interesting solution to the problem .
So you get into private space from the public area .
Another idea , from a nurse -- I love this idea --
They use the traditional company to use the slate ,
and put them on the wall of the ward
And so you can walk into the room
and I &apos;m going to talk to you about the patient
It &apos;s these , tiny and tiny solutions that make great influence .
And I think that &apos;s a very good example .
It &apos;s more like , looking for opportunities from something else .
I had to look at it , because I wanted to _UNK_ my name .
_UNK_ _UNK_ saw her daughter -- on Saturday morning ,
_UNK_ is _UNK_ from one country to another country .
He wondered why these people were going to take so long
George _UNK_ -- this is not a _UNK_ _UNK_ --
and walking with his dog , finding his pants and dogs _UNK_ .
a little _UNK_ , so there &apos;s a _UNK_ invention ,
Finally , the British people , _UNK_ -- this is a great invention of Britain --
And one day he drove home in the road
Seeing the cat &apos;s eyes on the side of the road , the _UNK_ sign was born .
This is an example of -- with your eyes ,
to look at things in the fresh eyes .
and then create new possibilities for opportunity .
&quot; In the edge of the world , watching things around .
The shallow eyes will only give a narrow solution .
will be able to find more new opportunities .
In _UNK_ we created a lot of _UNK_ technologies --
And they saw this , and they needed one .
And they &apos;re looking forward to the nurses and nurses
And when we watch the whole process of doing this ,
And there are some people who are in it ,
When your spine _UNK_ a four inches long --
the data input in the process of this device --
for pain management . You &apos;re scared -- you &apos;re scared .
So , almost every nurse would be able to
with their hands to comfort them . And this movement --
to get the data input into a completely impossible .
Based on this , we did not have a lot of popular technology ,
and it &apos;s not Palm _UNK_ , it &apos;s not .
You can put a _UNK_ on the top , so you can _UNK_ your hand .
And then back to our theme -- just because the little hand problem
It feels like we look around us . When I get here ,
I &apos;m going to look at TED and what &apos;s happening here .
the solutions that are going to be solved in life --
and the things that we &apos;re doing in general ,
And those _UNK_ , and they have a lot of potential --
We &apos;ve seen a book recently , maybe someone has seen it ,
And there are some things that people can make ,
Why are we always walking along the line ?
people always follow something , but they don &apos;t know what to do .
Why do people always put a square box on the square ?
This is because we &apos;re a little bit -- we have to do that .
Why are we always _UNK_ the tea bag on the _UNK_ ?
We just use the world around us
We usually tell the client , &quot; You should look at this ,
And this is important , and it &apos;s very important . &quot;
We assume that if there &apos;s a pole on the street ,
People can use it , so we parked the shopping cart there .
from one move to another to another .
I love a word that my mom told me ,
&quot; Your sister jumps into the bridge , but you don &apos;t have to jump together . &quot;
But we all jumped into it . We went on and over again .
is that they can do the same thing .
a lot of people have a similar idea .
I mean , plastic bags are equivalent to parking _UNK_ .
Everybody knows the meaning of these signals .
We communicate with these people all the time ,
as if you have a new idea , you know all your knowledge and experience ,
I have a friend of a designer in _UNK_ .
This is Billy _UNK_ -- the best selling product in _UNK_ .
_UNK_ it together . If it &apos;s my case ,
But it &apos;s still a good _UNK_ , how is this _UNK_ to children ?
The children don &apos;t want to _UNK_ things in order .
So first of all , you &apos;re going to -- this is _UNK_ , the designer --
and put yourself in the children &apos;s eyes . So , he said ,
What &apos;s this ? I hear you asking . No , I didn &apos;t hear it .
So , I think this is a particular design .
This is a new way of solving problems .
And of course , the _UNK_ bear may not like this .
But it doesn &apos;t _UNK_ the _UNK_ of it ,
to think about yourself in a different way ,
On the TED meeting , I heard the idea that
How do you think about yourself in a different way ,
and stand up at their feet and experience them .
I think this is the most important thing .
And that means to look at the _UNK_ ,
And one of the themes that are emphasized :
What are we going to do ? How do we start ?
One time , a company in Kenya called _UNK_ ,
It took a lot of time to figure out the shape .
When you &apos;re standing in those people &apos;s angle to think about it ,
you can see that this product is going to be folded ,
And you can put it on a bicycle , it &apos;s more important than the appearance .
In addition , the way to produce production
You have to be able to make _UNK_ ,
And this needs to look at it from a user &apos;s perspective ,
We had to move ourselves to their world
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ -- it &apos;s going to work up and down .
Children can use , adults can use , and everybody can easily operate .
It changed these people -- the other theme --
And finally , we have the needs of the client ,
to get them very satisfied with what we &apos;re designing ,
At the same time , the user _UNK_ the expectation of the product .
In _UNK_ , we took these chains to every person &apos;s hands
It &apos;s not a _UNK_ , but it &apos;s another project .
Because this symbol , investment on the things that we &apos;re dependent on .
So we _UNK_ this chain . &quot; In a very large scale ,
The green agenda may be the most important topic ,
We celebrate our 40 th anniversary of the year --
I &apos;m going to talk to you about the relationship
You can expect more distant , what &apos;s going to happen in the back ,
I think -- I &apos;ve been talking about a lot of years ago ,
It &apos;s not before the idea of green agenda ,
It &apos;s not for _UNK_ -- it &apos;s for survival .
But I never said , but now I &apos;m going to emphasize
I mean , all of the projects that are _UNK_
And that was celebrate the quality of life .
So , if I can , I &apos;m going to find an article
At the end of the year , someone presented this idea
about how individuals , as an important observer ,
I want to be in 2006 , the most important thing
is to let you know the concept of the environment .
So my _UNK_ is : green is new red , white , blue . &quot;
And I looked at myself in the past ,
&quot; When is the beginning of the earth and the _UNK_ ? &quot;
And that was the first time , the humans looked at the Earth .
In some sense , _UNK_ _UNK_ created the word .
before the collapse of the _UNK_ system ,
And I was honored to talk to many Soviet _UNK_
They &apos;re filled with a kind of _UNK_ passion ,
And there &apos;s a couple of things that happened .
_UNK_ _UNK_ is the kind of environmental leader --
He &apos;s a scientist , if you think , it &apos;s a poet ,
He expected all the things that were happening .
You can look at his work , and it &apos;s great .
_UNK_ , the citizens of the planet are _UNK_ ,
that influenced my mind and what was going on .
I chose this because it was in _UNK_ ,
There are some of the characteristics of this _UNK_ .
that are the things that are now made
In addition , they will only have your palm size .
you can get a lot of people together in virtual worlds ,
And in fact , this is being _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , and the direction of the analog world .
In _UNK_ , one of the more advanced developments ,
And again , it was inspired by the amazing experience .
in the &apos; 60s and the &apos; 60s ,
and a very _UNK_ way to convey the way .
And what happened in the early 2007 was that
I think we can easily _UNK_ ourselves ,
or anyone who &apos;s involved in the design process ,
is going to think that the solution is _UNK_ .
They are just part of the big scene .
In other words , I &apos;m going to try to explain
For example , if we &apos;re inspired by _UNK_ our words , we &apos;re going to take a step
And we see a typical , _UNK_ society ,
Building , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and industrial industries .
But again , this is just a part of the whole .
If you look at the building and the traffic ,
In other words , people &apos;s traffic , which is _UNK_ ,
is influenced by the city and the construction of how to work together .
can &apos;t separate the nature of the city in the building ,
For example , you compare the two cities ,
I said , briefly , a city of North American America --
In Detroit , a lot of dependent on the car .
more ways , more energy , more energy --
and the consumption of people in the middle of the city --
So , the center of the city , as it &apos;s not people ,
Life space , just as a business center , it dies .
If you compare Detroit with a city in _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s a good choice to do it ,
_UNK_ is dependent on walking and riding a bicycle ,
So this density has doubled the city ,
Basically , if you want to do that , you can say ,
In the bottom , as the population rises ,
And of course , you can &apos;t get away
the feasibility of walking through the distance ,
But you can see Detroit , in the top yellow section ,
than some of the real cities that are not _UNK_ .
In 2000 , there was a rather interesting thing .
The first time you see _UNK_ or more giant cities ,
33 giant cities are all in developing countries .
So you &apos;re going to ask yourself --
If you take China , or just Beijing for example ,
and the amount of pollution that leads to energy
when the car becomes as cheap as a bicycle .
In other words , if you have 1,000 cars a day ,
The data shows that this is the most _UNK_ car market in the world .
And the bike of the _UNK_ is reducing .
If we think about the transformation of our society
It took 200 years from space to the city ,
And the same process took 20 years to go .
It &apos;s going to be said that 10 times the whole time .
And it &apos;s interesting that about 60 years ago ,
in the same way that we can see
And the tools that are going to happen
I &apos;m going to use my own experience as an example ,
to take some of the work to explain --
How do you measure the scale of technology ?
and we create energy that we create ,
The story happened at the end of the &apos; 60s .
One example is the headquarters building of a enterprise .
in a business town in the northeast England ,
The roof of the building is like a roof
a space that is shared in the public space .
In other words , this community has a air garden .
The human idea is that in these works ,
Maybe this also covers in my early manuscript ,
When you see green , when you see the sun ,
Nature is one of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ of the building .
_UNK_ the interior color is green and yellow .
It &apos;s got a swimming pool , and it &apos;s going to work for a long time ,
There &apos;s a social center , and there &apos;s a space that you can get along with nature .
And the one that I &apos;m going to use
It &apos;s a very long time for the building .
And if you look at it carefully ,
It &apos;s actually telling you that you can do it for this building .
In this case , it was a typewriter in the picture .
And when you take pictures , it becomes a computer .
They all say that the _UNK_ is our competitors .
You have to be able to build a new technology building .
It was expected to change , even those _UNK_ changes .
It &apos;s about the design of the building
I took a copy of the book before I got it out of the files .
I said , &quot; But we don &apos;t have that time ,
to build something that &apos;s really interesting to do .
like to create a 3D bubble --
to breathe and actually reduce the energy consumption .
In fact , the building is also a green building ,
If I take the time , the interesting thing is ,
Now the technology can work and be worth celebrate .
The library of the free college last year ,
from the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and the _UNK_ _UNK_ that are heavy ,
And there &apos;s also a way of being _UNK_
And it can also work in the way nature works .
And what &apos;s interesting is that this is the _UNK_
And that brings us back to the taste of life ,
In some sense , people all agree to the _UNK_ issue .
It &apos;s not a sacrifice , but it &apos;s just the opposite .
I think it &apos;s a great thing to celebrate .
the material -- because there &apos;s technology and computer help ,
It was a very advanced building that was built .
And I &apos;m going to look at this technology ,
to cross the boundary of Switzerland -- to cross a little bit ,
There &apos;s a little factory in Germany , and you can see somebody standing here ,
And the interesting thing is , and then the building is built
The oldest techniques are covered with _UNK_ , like _UNK_ tiles .
to finish the final surface with _UNK_ tiles .
And again , the building is going to be ,
We enjoy the time where we live there .
I jump up here to talk about these new technologies ,
What happened before that -- what was going on ?
I mean , before you think about _UNK_ things ,
This is the interior of the Hong Kong Bank ,
In 1985 , it could _UNK_ the sun
In the absence of computers , you have to make an entity model .
For example , we put the model in the artificial sky .
for thousands of meters and so on .
For us , the turning point is going to happen
And then we were exploring the world
This is the fourth _UNK_ of the _UNK_ airport , a typical _UNK_ .
You know you &apos;re there , and you &apos;re also wired to the outside world .
The whole cycle is that it doesn &apos;t need lights --
And that is the institution at the airport .
They &apos;re still using the big ruler and the square .
It &apos;s not a long time ago , but look at us now .
And before I look back , there &apos;s a guy named _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
In 1987 , she has all the data on a disk .
Now , every week our data is equivalent to the _UNK_ ,
This is what you see from the height .
As a public space , we want to find ways
public space , maybe in hidden issues , there &apos;s energy _UNK_ --
Again , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ becomes the public space .
But the part of this environment is that
But we don &apos;t need to actually make a model .
to explore , planning , and see how it will be .
Natural ventilation , we can simulate the space of the underground ,
_UNK_ , underground _UNK_ , burning vegetable oil --
And you can compare the building of this building
At the beginning of the project , it was _UNK_ tons .
to reduce _UNK_ -- it &apos;s almost zero pollution .
But again , with life taste and quality --
a place where people can make it work .
The Swiss insurance company has further advanced the development of this development .
This sequence of images will be shown in simulation .
And the first thing that I think is interesting ,
is the public space you see in the circle and circle .
For example , you can go to a building
and it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ line ,
Finally , you can describe a _UNK_ , remove the lines .
And the design of the triangle has improved performance ,
It also gives the unique identity recognition of the building .
And if we look at it carefully ,
how the building is going to stretch up ,
Now , with computers , we can simulate the _UNK_ ,
and see the _UNK_ , the low pressure ,
The building itself is like the wing of the wing .
It also has the ability to , at any time ,
to keep the building _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
The floor of the building is also the public space .
If we tried to use this kind of design strategy ,
you know that the Dead Sea is dying .
The sea level is falling , a bit like the _UNK_ Sea .
So there &apos;s a plan to save the Dead Sea ,
A _UNK_ is filled with a _UNK_ of water .
in the last 40 years of accumulated knowledge ,
If you don &apos;t have to carry the line ,
If this is the same thing as _UNK_ ,
And if you go back to the picture ,
And you see this _UNK_ and the _UNK_ area ,
a design that will combine the humanitarian _UNK_
It &apos;s likely to be able to get together ,
For the common reason , _UNK_ is a great importance .
And in the world , how do we make more clear ,
especially in some of the places I &apos;ve talked about --
China , in the future of the future ,
How do you get a large airport to be more friendly ?
In Hong Kong , I describe it as a digital experience .
If we expand this to the Chinese society ,
And the interesting thing is that the result is going to be
This is the biggest project on the planet .
I am sorry that 50,000 people work 24 hours a day , work seven times a week .
than the _UNK_ airport is going to be _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ and the fifth _UNK_ of the building .
And the challenge is to cover a green building ,
It also emphasizes friendly _UNK_ , and it goes back to the _UNK_ ,
Perhaps this will be a place to celebrate .
What _UNK_ said was all right , &quot; These are new churches . &quot;
In some sense , this section of the speech
When I talk about the Olympic Games in China ,
And the idea of what happened in that _UNK_ ,
It was like the symbol of 2006 to 2007 ,
And as Kennedy said , &quot; Well , you know ,
We &apos;ve _UNK_ the dependence of fuel in the industry ,
to get rid of the _UNK_ regime control price , etc .
not just a device , you know , it can regenerate .
I said a idea that maybe in a new year ,
is going to come from other countries --
Even today in _UNK_ , I like this word ,
We all heard some extraordinary stories about each other .
But in my opinion , there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to affect them .
is that they &apos;re all &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; I call
in a _UNK_ that has a billion people .
Well , in the next eight minutes , I &apos;d like to share with you about transmission .
I was talking to _UNK_ , and they really agreed to me
_UNK_ me , we drank tea to talk and talk about it .
And I &apos;m so _UNK_ that this is so amazing .
What I hope is that when I was seven years old ,
So , 10 years ago , when I came to _UNK_ , I started teaching .
I was there to create and _UNK_ a process
a process that can keep transmission to people ,
If you _UNK_ the lines of classroom teaching and life ,
So I &apos;m going to show you some of the things that we &apos;re going to do
_UNK_ the background : our fifth grade students are learning about children &apos;s rights .
to get them to the state of labor ,
and you &apos;re going to see the experiences of them
with this experience , they &apos;re going to move out of the classroom !
And after two hours , they got back to pain .
Notice that the expression of his expression changes
into &quot; I &apos;m doing it , &quot; This is my thinking of _UNK_ ! &quot;
And this is a process that can be inspired and _UNK_ .
&quot; Well , our kids can be good for us . &quot;
from this piece of India over 2,000 schools .
The children in _UNK_ elementary school were 10 in India .
So , it &apos;s very effective , and it &apos;s going to go out
The children came out of the campus and went through the _UNK_ .
The relation to all children , so we are _UNK_ , and never shy .
and walked into the city and went into the department ,
We said , &quot; When are you going to be _UNK_ , &quot;
&quot; Do you realize that every child has a big potential ? &quot;
&quot; When are you going to take the children as a _UNK_ ? &quot;
It &apos;s very simple that if you open your mind and communicate with them .
the _UNK_ streets in the city stopped driving .
and _UNK_ the World of _UNK_ for children .
This is the city told her children , &quot; You know ! &quot;
and the police and the journalists in the town
_UNK_ _UNK_ : _UNK_ was a group of children who had been trained before .
We plan to spread this to the rest of the city .
_UNK_ _UNK_ : The city will provide free time .
_UNK_ had a love for children in the world .
_UNK_ : Now the city is taking care of children
They will return to the city in the future .
So , you &apos;re going to build a model for 200 children in _UNK_
The children have designed all kinds of solutions
from being _UNK_ and _UNK_ the pavement .
This is not the _UNK_ of the adults .
_UNK_ : My parents are _UNK_ , and I &apos;m going to teach them how to write
The first time , _UNK_ and street games in the _UNK_ countryside
to tell you that _UNK_ culture is very important .
We learned how to read and write from our children , too !
&#91; Woman &#93; _UNK_ : My students were in this event .
And then , I &apos;m not going to doubt their ability .
&#91; Woman &#93; _UNK_ the way they &apos;re young , but they &apos;re doing it well !
They first cleaned our community , and then the whole India .
And this is a _UNK_ to me .
We have a lot of wonderful paintings that are going to be sold today .
The auction will be used to purchase hearing aids .
Well , a love love of love has lived .
How can it be immune to such passion , energy , that excitement ?
But I have to end with a most powerful change , he &apos;s _UNK_ .
And I heard the front audience and said , &quot; We know , India &apos;s people , right ? &quot;
Let me tell you , simplicity , is my personal journey ,
It &apos;s based on a lot of human intelligence .
and the idea of knowledge and creativity ,
Now , I &apos;m _UNK_ dollars , as a consultant ,
and tried to ask myself , &quot; There &apos;s no connection ,
you can see how many of these income are .
And you get a reward , or you don &apos;t know what to do ?
is that I &apos;m good at the data ?
_UNK_ is the reward I &apos;ve got to do ?
I &apos;ve been working on the exploitation of exploitation ,
because in my income _UNK_ in the tax _UNK_ ,
who shared their wisdom , faith and trust ,
so many of the things that I was working at that time
Most of the people I &apos;ve done have never known English .
from people who get knowledge , to make them _UNK_ ,
I did a consultant , and I wrote a report ,
And then there was a contradiction in the mind ,
If I was a _UNK_ , that was wrong ,
And this is a very painful moment .
_UNK_ is not special , but the solution must be special .
And then one day -- I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on --
Or in my mind , if I could be a bee ,
and the bees don &apos;t retain all the _UNK_ .
There are three rules in the society of bees --
And that thing must be shared by their language and these people .
And I have to tell you , 20 years later ,
It makes me feel that I still have such a tragedy ,
And I hope all of you have to look like this .
The study of the American Science institution
Whatever you learn from other people must share with them .
But we don &apos;t even do justice in the knowledge market .
Obviously , we can &apos;t have two different _UNK_ systems ,
you can &apos;t only benefit from your values ,
Can you tell me where it &apos;s going to be filmed ,
_UNK_ : But what did this photograph be used ? What did it do ?
You know , you &apos;re right . We must give him _UNK_ .
because the man knows how much we have in the government .
Look at this . This is the place of the Indian government .
It &apos;s entirely on how you see people &apos;s lives .
If you have this woman who wants to _UNK_
So let me tell you that all the science we have now ,
_UNK_ women still need to move their heads into _UNK_ .
The tea , the tea tree , the tea tree .
Do you know what a series of moves ? This series of movement is :
The _UNK_ _UNK_ a few leaves and put them in the back basket .
You eat rice at lunch , you will eat today ,
the silence of the _UNK_ , which leads us attention , cannot continue .
It &apos;s not what our Congress will do , you know .
from this country to work for 100 days .
The poor have legs and hands , but there is no brain ?
The bee network is also rich in the poor classes .
of the great wisdom of the _UNK_ ,
But our work is in the technology of technology .
This guy , we meet , you &apos;ll see it on the website ,
He said , &quot; If I want to be true --
somebody &apos;s sick and needs a nurse --
If you fix him , I &apos;ll paint it on the wall . &quot;
because the poor in this country can get a _UNK_ .
to think about the _UNK_ of _UNK_
the spirit of the spirit of the spirit .
They have to achieve the goal that they can only solve their minds .
We see in the expedition . We &apos;re going to go every six months .
We walked 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years .
You see this woman , she stands on the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
This is the only place she can make her creative .
He was on a strong grain basket , and we were on the expedition
The whole wall is _UNK_ . She &apos;s wearing a _UNK_ sitting there .
we don &apos;t just hire them to _UNK_ or rock .
They will be _UNK_ because they are good at it .
There are a lot of people selling tea in the _UNK_ .
You can drink tea every morning and drink coffee .
This coffee machine costs hundreds of _UNK_ than _UNK_ .
This machine can help _UNK_ ; the ordinary _UNK_ machine usually won &apos;t wear so much .
to be able to get the best _UNK_
But what they wanted was the good thing to do
but he &apos;s not enough . Look at what he &apos;s doing .
If you have clothing , you don &apos;t have time to wash ,
He will wear your door for your _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I can wash your clothes for you , only one _UNK_ .
some people who can help them expand their business scale .
But what do you know ? Anybody can guess a guess ?
because of the things that have gone after a while . Where is it ?
to your stomach . He didn &apos;t invent it for eating .
In addition , the poor method is not necessarily a _UNK_ way .
and it &apos;s not necessarily a mountain or a _UNK_ .
but better , more efficient and more efficient .
I think we need a _UNK_ model ,
in the different parts of the country and the world ,
is that the _UNK_ supply is far too far .
Why do anyone want to adjust the _UNK_ thing ?
It &apos;s going to be expanded and it &apos;s expanding .
For example , cell phones : this country has _UNK_ phones .
Now , maybe I use two _UNK_ for cell phones ,
He had 300 ; I paid 300 ; I only had three ,
But I &apos;d like to have it , so this is a model that can expand .
But if I had to find the relative system ,
Obviously , I need to design different phones .
You have to have a solution to the most _UNK_ ,
and even find ways to encourage these kinds of solutions
And one of the things that we &apos;ve been studying
a lot of times the _UNK_ would ask this question --
They only thought about the needs of a community
And those needs to be limited to that place ,
There is no legal power to _UNK_ them ,
And you can reduce your demand to agree to the big environment .
that people can focus on their own wisdom , we &apos;ll invest in this combination ,
At the same time , the profit of this model becomes clear .
because he _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ World ,
And we couldn &apos;t persuade the fire department
people , and they &apos;ve just happened a few years ago ,
And people need to walk 20 kilometers , _UNK_ ,
Look , your fire department should be ready for this ,
You can &apos;t walk the road , your traffic tool can &apos;t get anywhere .
in the floods as a sales device ,
But there is a good idea ; there is a good point to mind .
What has been done by _UNK_ ? Unfortunately , _UNK_ has left .
_UNK_ : I looked at the world every day .
It wasn &apos;t like a coconut _UNK_ on my head ,
and the palm tree gets a lot of samples ,
Without that invention , she needed a bigger machine .
And her students wanted to use this machine
So , you see , we &apos;re standing in the _UNK_ of science .
You can go to _UNK_ and look at Indian _UNK_ ,
And when she was just the fifth grade ,
But it improved _UNK_ to help him get free .
how to expand this model in China and Brazil .
And we have a very powerful network in China ,
But also in Brazil and the rest of the world .
The front frame , you can &apos;t find a different place .
India and China have the biggest number of _UNK_ .
The point is that we should not be _UNK_ ,
We should not believe in such a _UNK_
It &apos;s only our country to have a good idea .
No , we must need to be a _UNK_ .
The poor are learning the knowledge of _UNK_ , whatever they are .
Look at the invention of these _UNK_ :
We can share with the colleagues of South Africa
They _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
This is in China . This girl needs to breathe .
&quot; How do we extension this girl &apos;s life in the village ? &quot;
They didn &apos;t have a relationship with her , but they tried to figure out the answer ,
They built a _UNK_ with a motor . They built a _UNK_ .
We have all kinds of different inventions .
You can &apos;t find this car in the United States or Europe ,
Now this woman , she used to roll the coil
For seven years , this is what her son did .
He said , &quot; I can &apos;t . It &apos;s the only thing I know , but I &apos;m going to invent a machine ,
This is what he did in the _UNK_ .
&quot; Give me a _UNK_ , I can move the Earth . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to do it in kids .
Here , a company used to use this drug _UNK_ technology
to put the _UNK_ pictures on the packaging
It tells the client , &quot; You can be a inventor .
If you have a idea to send us . &quot;
And it &apos;s not just the power of matter , but the power of spiritual power .
is that in the use of _UNK_ .
The lights in our office are usually like this .
And the light is supposed to be a luxury ,
to be able to come out of that .
And this is what we call the designer _UNK_ .
&quot; light , in my design , is to enjoy it . &quot;
What he means is that it &apos;s not a _UNK_ meal .
The beauty of the building brings to the spirit of people .
And the building environment gave us more enjoy
that is concentrated and is the sun .
But remember all the energy on this planet
from the _UNK_ of _UNK_ in Italy .
to the subtle control of the light .
and it &apos;s not going to get into the light .
At design , they deliberately left some _UNK_ places .
And you can see here , there &apos;s some light _UNK_ down the floor ,
But they can immediately judge where the beam came from .
So people thought about this funny way .
And I want to talk to you about this picture
and at the same level it was dark .
And here I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
There &apos;s a reputation in this office that the team named &quot; white &quot;
in green energy counseling or something like that .
There is no use of a artificial light in the office .
_UNK_ the lighting at the same time is the change of _UNK_ .
And sometimes the light becomes _UNK_ when you work .
and sometimes it becomes bright and bright .
It &apos;s not a boring boy , not a _UNK_ ,
I must introduce this man to you today .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m going to take him right now .
Richard _UNK_ , the first time in the _UNK_ .
or this guy who &apos;s working for the General _UNK_ .
and I thought , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s too amazing . &quot;
This is what I &apos;m going to show you later .
It &apos;s also the sun that goes through the clouds ,
or like the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ today ,
to make a atmosphere that leads you to _UNK_ around .
In my opinion , this is a very comfortable light ,
The horizon in Hong Kong is a good example ,
And there &apos;s no use of _UNK_ that we can &apos;t create .
I think Richard _UNK_ , the one on the left ,
This is a picture of the American Medical Library ,
The disease was _UNK_ to recover in the sun .
The yellow light is the most beneficial thing to us ,
This rhythm reminds us when we wake up , when we should rest ,
_UNK_ our _UNK_ and _UNK_ like this .
can help people to relax or adjust to the state of alert ,
And you can also improve the classroom of kids .
_UNK_ , it &apos;s the same thing in social interaction .
and we &apos;re going to be together in this room .
When you look at this planet at night , it &apos;s like this .
And I think this is what I &apos;m talking about today .
From the global view , the image becomes like this .
It &apos;s a pretty amazing case that you can see
If there were no _UNK_ lights for these people , the face of the Earth ,
So we see the Earth should be such a _UNK_ picture ,
This is a photograph I took in Guangzhou two weeks ago ,
What kind of way is people _UNK_ in many new cities ?
It seems that the lighting should be used
And of course , we also have _UNK_ and neon lights .
And this light gives us a unique opportunity
We can take it all around , and we need to get it out .
when you don &apos;t have to turn off
I think this is a very good proposal .
It also provides a new kind of healthy health .
Now I want to show you how LED works ,
But it &apos;s full of light , my fingers can put four LED ,
And you can &apos;t see it in a way .
So I &apos;m going to ask my _UNK_ to think about it ,
And so they gave me a special talk to Amsterdam
This is the same thing on the screen -- but it &apos;s 200 times .
Now I &apos;m going to explain it very quickly
At last , the _UNK_ became a warm _UNK_ .
And then you add a lens on it ,
can come together with light to the ideal place ,
It &apos;s not going to be able to _UNK_ the darkness .
It was time to review the way we had the city &apos;s lighting .
so that we can benefit from the dark , _UNK_ environment ?
For example , this is a relatively low consumption state .
And so they can also be _UNK_ into the entire lighting environment ?
Is it beautiful to enjoy it from inside ?
because the Earth is going to find this place
It was even more _UNK_ to find such a _UNK_ .
Even at sea , the size of the big light
and it &apos;s a big impact on the planet .
And we found that if we turned those lights into green ,
We &apos;re going to start using the dark _UNK_ ,
And this is a very violent picture ,
Where do they come from , where are they going ?
What &apos;s happened ? What &apos;s going to happen five minutes later ?
is because of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_
We can make a design for an entertainment place .
to see a couple of stars and even see nothing .
If you &apos;re designing the lighting to join the _UNK_ elements ,
So many of my inspiration here is from this theater .
I &apos;m really happy today that you can first go to the theatre ,
I think we should all be _UNK_ to the theatre .
As you say , every time you come to study something .
the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ --
The final conclusion is that people should not sit down and continue .
A couple of cars yesterday came up with new ideas ,
They believe that 30 to 50 years later ,
And then they said that some other devices can be able to operate ,
It &apos;s good , why don &apos;t you get rid of the wires ?
then you can drive a car when you think about it .
to talk about the heat of the technology
But before that , I said to you ,
from the beginning of the technology that we &apos;ve developed ,
And of course , when we apply technology to _UNK_ ,
But the question I think is now ,
On one hand , there &apos;s a lot of data
I &apos;d like to show you a different form .
is not going to know why it is ,
Everybody believes that the car changes the world .
About a hundred years ago , Ford started producing T _UNK_
For example , the Americans at the time
It &apos;s important to have no _UNK_ for the _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s much faster than the _UNK_ .
And it also improved the environment , because it was
In _UNK_ , the city of Manhattan has been _UNK_ ,
You can imagine the way the street looks like
And they &apos;re all _UNK_ or doing something else .
will lead to a number of _UNK_ and other problems .
So the car is a vehicle for more health .
The car is also allowing people to _UNK_ themselves .
to walk into the streets and to get
It &apos;s convenient for the population of _UNK_ .
In the &apos; 50s , we built a highway system to connect all town together ,
It was called a great wonder for the world .
And at the same time , because I &apos;m interested in technology
I want to assure you -- especially in particular ,
I don &apos;t think this invention will compete with aircraft or cars .
Half the population in the world are living in cities .
These problems changed the world and shape it into the present .
500 years ago , the _UNK_ _UNK_ technology has developed
_UNK_ years ago , the steam trains were high .
In the 19th century , we started making cars
Let &apos;s get a half of the 20th century
And so our life has been greatly improved .
But at the same time , more baby was born ,
more and more people are moving into cities
In the next 15 years , China has been there
and four to four people will move to cities
So no one would deny that in the past ,
The plane converted the continent and the country into a community .
And if you look at how technology works ,
And of course , I &apos;m not going to leave my airplane .
a helicopter or a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ .
And although I didn &apos;t put them in my house , I loved them .
The fact is that the problem is that at the end
When half of the population is in _UNK_
It took about 90 to 90 percent to walk
I don &apos;t know how the data can make you _UNK_ .
The car in the big city is _UNK_ away .
_UNK_ fuel in the world is much more efficient .
Every year there were _UNK_ citizens who died of air pollution
are from traffic tools , especially in urban areas ,
And I &apos;m not going to attack any industry ,
And I really love my airplane , and I love it .
And there &apos;s a car that _UNK_ at 60 miles an hour
of the energy consumption and the benefits of energy
We all love our car , and I &apos;m also .
The question is , if you go into town , you want to walk four _UNK_ .
If , in 1998 , _UNK_ were riding in bike
If the people in _UNK_ became the middle class ,
and want us to walk through our way over the last hundred years .
And half of the population is six weeks
the area and the density of density in Manhattan
the economy is not , because there is no oil
I mean , what are we going to do now ?
We can make the problem complicated , but what is the world currently struggling ?
For me , some of you have to get up at the end ,
Luckily , we &apos;re working on _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It &apos;s going to replace the yacht , you don &apos;t need water .
Or _UNK_ , this is pure entertainment , and you love playing around .
In addition , all the industries in the world
There is no license that we often do ,
I think if we don &apos;t use all of our energy
but to understand how other problems in the world
and began to accept the cities of the city ,
Back to the ancient times , people were going to walk .
for the city that we &apos;ve built for humans
I mean , look at how long it takes in _UNK_ ,
And we went back to the city again .
the most expensive real estate in the city
_UNK_ Hill , the fifth _UNK_ , Tokyo , or Paris --
There are _UNK_ areas in the city as a parking park .
You might ask , if the city could give people
What do we think is the right thing to do with the city ?
If we can make the city more interesting , more _UNK_ and neat .
If you can make the final ring of the mass transport ,
to come out , and to your car becomes more _UNK_ ,
So we can all live in the suburbs ,
And it &apos;s a great thing to do that .
One of the problems that we care about
is how to walk on the sidewalk ,
because I have motor and wheel , I &apos;m a vehicle .
in a crowded place to deal with other people .
It took an hour in the crowd .
I &apos;m a _UNK_ . But the law is usually worse than technology .
If we can &apos;t pull away , we have two choices ,
But I &apos;m not going to spend the time on this .
or we should walk up the streets ,
The same way to the bus or the engine .
We went to the front of the _UNK_
And the first one is to show him
and said , &quot; Give you this device , everybody &apos;s trust .
They should use it on the pavement , and they will seriously use it . &quot;
He agreed that we went to the police department
And they wanted to get into the community in time
and carry this _UNK_ material . They love to die .
I don &apos;t believe that the police will give me a ticket
But we know that the development of technology
it &apos;s not going to be as difficult as culture _UNK_ and applications .
We &apos;ve seen some people who have a vision ,
for enough money to make us develop this stuff ,
I hope that we have enough time to get them satisfied .
I &apos;d like to talk about this technology .
It &apos;s really interesting that you should go out and try
If I could ask you to do one thing ,
not to think of it as a technology .
but to imagine that although we all understand
We use this _UNK_ machine that we use
to the rationality of any place we want to go .
is the tool that we use in the last mile ,
One of the most exciting things we &apos;ve ever seen
Let &apos;s think it might be accepted , and it &apos;s happening here in California .
In Venice , we took a news worker
a little woman , went to the dictionary ,
And she came to me in this room
And I was here , and I was as young as adults .
And she stopped , and she looked up at me .
How are we going to talk about ?
And I went down , and she was kind of _UNK_ .
And then she went , and she was probably going to go
And then she walked back , and she went all over the day ,
And she came back and said , &quot; Well , you know ,
The _UNK_ gave her the microphone to her
She still looked at those people , saying , &quot; I won &apos;t ride a bicycle , &quot; No ,
&quot; I &apos;m not going to _UNK_ , I &apos;m not going to _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have a bicycle for 50 years . &quot;
And then she looked up and she said ,
&quot; I &apos;m not going to drive a car now ,
I &apos;m going to go to the store , and I can &apos;t mention a lot of things , &quot;
And suddenly I realized that in many of my fears ,
is not just a bureaucracy , the authorities
And basically , there &apos;s a lot of pressure from the masses
is that you don &apos;t have to _UNK_ the cities
Look at the 36 inch wide sidewalk in the law ,
eight feet of parking space , plus three _UNK_ ,
And then I was eight feet later ,
Let me realize that kids don &apos;t care about these things ,
And they don &apos;t vote , traders and teenagers
they don &apos;t mind , they &apos;re very _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ will be concerned about the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
So , you see this , after eight years later ,
First of all , I called the phone to ask our market department and _UNK_ .
And then they took it to Washington and showed
and see how these things are being accepted in some cities ,
For instance , we did it in the local trial ?
The bottom line is , whether you believe the U.N. or not ,
In the next 20 years , all the population will grow
_UNK_ Asia will have a billion people .
They don &apos;t have to go through a hundred years .
They start with the top of the food chain ,
We have to start building cities and the human environment
to make _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ in the environment .
And the _UNK_ used this _UNK_ machine
and moving them into the city , but think about it :
The Greeks went to the temple from the _UNK_ Theater .
If you move faster than three times -- three times --
If you live in town , your choice is 10 minutes --
If you want half an hour , you need another way , bus or train ,
We have to build this -- the light _UNK_ --
But if you do it in most cities ,
Imagine if you have time , you can walk more than half an hour in the city .
If you can make it fun , it &apos;s eight to eight hours .
You don &apos;t have a car , you get a car , drive .
You can &apos;t play the subway without hitting it .
you can change the way we can mix the resources .
We hope history will prove that we are right .
We &apos;ve got a lot of work to get this _UNK_ .
This little _UNK_ is producing hundreds of power .
You can go from New York to Boston ,
Perhaps this little machine is more interesting , it will burn any fuel .
And the effect of this kind of performance
In most places you can &apos;t plug 120 volts _UNK_
From the Johnson Company , to use the _UNK_ ,
A _UNK_ or a gasoline _UNK_ for an hour .
But at any time , it will burn the same speed
because it &apos;s burned outside , and it &apos;s like your stove .
If any fuel can be used , then it &apos;s clean .
For example , it &apos;s just enough electricity to do that .
In other places , there was enough power in the evening
And as Dr. _UNK_ pointed out that ,
You never have to achieve more than two .
And there &apos;s no big relationship that if you have _UNK_ electricity ,
If you want to _UNK_ water and _UNK_ it at 10 pounds a hour ,
to spend 25 , a thousand _UNK_ --
The constant power of the _UNK_ will be finished .
so much energy , you can &apos;t be in our country
Of course , in other parts of the world , you choose to destroy this place ,
to convert everything into heat , or to drink all the water .
The first reason that the world &apos;s deadly water is dirty .
We don &apos;t need to have a _UNK_ heart transplant .
Women don &apos;t spend four hours a day looking for water
We &apos;re going to study how to compress the steam over it .
and _UNK_ it with _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
in the process of using a small amount of power
with 450 _UNK_ , it &apos;s half the heat of waste ,
you can make 10 _UNK_ of water every hour .
from any fuel that has been used to cool it .
If you put the boxes in this case ,
And that &apos;s the question that many of you are focused on .
Technology trends are what we need to write and understand .
but as much as all the monthly magazine ,
Your readers live in the future . So we need to go ahead .
We &apos;re going to need a couple of months ago ,
We need to _UNK_ the public for six months later ,
even nine months later . So what we do is predict work .
We also create products as well as other companies .
In this case , our product is thought and information , if lucky ,
And more importantly , when -- time time is everything .
And the interesting thing is that when you look at some predictions ,
the predictions of electronic commerce in the &apos; 90s
or about the Internet , broadband use and network advertising ,
They &apos;re all right , but it &apos;s just the wrong time .
And almost all of these things became reality a few years later .
But the difference between the stock market in a few years .
It &apos;s obviously big . So the time is everything .
This is the classic _UNK_ curve , which is about
In order to make fun , we &apos;ve _UNK_ a lot of technology
to show that they &apos;re hearing the first peak .
or go back to the _UNK_ , or the _UNK_ ,
This is a way to predict the direction of technology ,
where technology is , and then see the next _UNK_
We tend to analyze any of the important technologies
We usually do two times , and the first time is to _UNK_
And the first time is to do these things ,
You can see Linux on the cover of the 1997 .
But they will come back . There &apos;s no big technology
are going to go into the mainstream and then explode .
So last year , it was a good time to do it again .
This is the way we _UNK_ the technological _UNK_ .
I want to talk about how to think about technology .
I can call the _UNK_ theory of the future ,
But it &apos;s more close to the _UNK_ theory of the future .
And that is : all important technologies have experienced four stages --
at least four stages , sometimes four stages of all .
And every stage of each of them can be seen as a hit .
For example , a critical price line will change technology .
and it affects the world . It &apos;s a chance to change .
And these are the people who tell you
What is the next chapter of this technology ,
and what you can do about it .
when it &apos;s less than the critical price ,
If it is a successful technology , it will be more critical and _UNK_ .
and near their _UNK_ , they become almost free .
In this case , every stage has the opportunity to give us .
Even if you miss the first stage , like the first wave ,
You know , _UNK_ experienced the critical price and the critical amount
But it &apos;s also _UNK_ , and it &apos;s not even free stages --
I want to use the DVD story to show
because this technology has been through all these stages .
As you know , DVD is starting to enter the market in the &apos; 90s .
And it was expensive at that time . But in 1998 ,
It &apos;s got 400 dollars below , 400 dollars is a key psychological price ,
So it &apos;s going to fly , and you can see the product sales .
It &apos;s a potential turning point , and it &apos;s going to go fast .
A year later , it entered the next stage , namely _UNK_ .
Usually , 20 % of family _UNK_ is a reasonable sign of technical scale .
And the other thing is that the home theater device
you also have the reason for buying a big screen television ,
And you have the same kind of _UNK_ that they have
The interesting thing is that _UNK_ was founded in 1999 .
And Rick _UNK_ is here today . He saw this moment ,
and realized that this was a turning point ,
You can see , at 2001 , it &apos;s selling more than a video camera .
From here , you can look at the impact of the world
_UNK_ is right , the _UNK_ can be used
One of the many features of DVD is that it &apos;s _UNK_ .
You can put it in the mail , it &apos;s very cheap .
It &apos;s not that obvious thing to be .
There is a company called _UNK_ , a _UNK_ company .
In the last few years , it has become DVD
_UNK_ in the United States . Their average price was 48 dollars a year .
And what happens is that when they get more cheap ,
_UNK_ brands , like Sony , lost the market share ,
When things reach their point , the market competition is cruel .
Now , the four ways to look at technology :
And I want to talk about some other technology ,
We &apos;ve been looking at some of the techniques that I &apos;m going to use this angle ,
And these four stages , to tell you
Every technology is in the development of the development .
They &apos;re not necessarily the top 10 technical technologies
but I think it &apos;s going to work out
The intersection of these _UNK_ is very _UNK_ .
As you know , most of the genes sequence
is done on the computer , so the price is now
By the end of this year , as long as the _UNK_ of human genes
And over a few years ago , it needed billions of dollars .
You know , we &apos;re getting closer and closer
And the interesting thing is that the number of genes we find
Each gene has the potential to evaluate the diagnosis .
when thousands of experiments can be done very cheap ,
If you &apos;re interested , you can understand your genes _UNK_ .
a wonderful study of health organizations in the world
The effect of _UNK_ and _UNK_ on the treatment of AIDS .
In January 2000 , it was 10,000 dollars , 27 dollars .
The first of all , is from Brazil ,
The most interesting thing is that if you look at the price _UNK_ ,
If you look at the relationship between the two sides ,
The price of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ can be treated .
the number of people went up . Bill Clinton Foundation and World Health Organization
believe that they can provide treatment for _UNK_ people in 2005 --
The reduction of the _UNK_ has played a big role .
Some of the technologies are going to go to _UNK_ .
You see , Linux is red , it gets 20 percent ,
It &apos;s important to cross the cross of the blue line .
But you can see that the curve is going
You can see 20 % of it , it looks _UNK_ .
the problem of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
Another technology around us is a hybrid drive car .
I don &apos;t know who you have in 2004 , they &apos;re pretty good .
You see the trends here : to 2008 ,
I think this is not a crazy prediction ,
_UNK_ is not 20 percent , but it &apos;s a slow car industry ,
They will be seen in the road after the arrival of _UNK_ .
People introduced electric motors into the car industry .
This is the first big change in automobile industry .
And after electric motors , you can do anything :
you can change the structure of the car ,
You can do _UNK_ , you can make _UNK_ ,
And it starts with this little bit of power ,
It will lead _UNK_ to a new era .
You may have heard about the IP transmission ,
The founder of _UNK_ founded a company called Skype .
and look at numbers , and they &apos;re starting in August last year ,
There is now a _UNK_ for the users .
And the same thing happened in the _UNK_ company .
You can see that IP is replacing the traditional tradition .
If _UNK_ is here , forgive me , this will change .
The economic model of this industry , speed , and player .
It looks like a little bit like that .
because the cost of _UNK_ is basically free , with free IP ,
because it &apos;s a very effective agreement . It &apos;s free of fiber technology ,
You know , free is the gift of the Silicon Valley .
This is what you do in a hard disk .
You know that it can also be used to save movies here ,
At the end of 2008 , all the songs in the world can be stored .
a value 400 bucks . So , to store songs ,
I mean , the whole _UNK_ is _UNK_ ,
In our _UNK_ , Hollywood is worried about it .
They are facing a kind of pressure that has never been used .
to get them out of the way .
And finally , I &apos;ll give you a free example
and the most powerful one . I mentioned fiber :
This is the global global cost of India ,
What &apos;s interesting is that this is the price of 1990 ,
The price at that time was two dollars a minute .
India and we have a normal call system .
but it &apos;s because the fiber is everywhere .
You don &apos;t want to go on , so you see the price fall very fast .
And it &apos;s cheap that even free phone causes ?
It &apos;s _UNK_ _UNK_ , and it &apos;s the work _UNK_ ,
This is probably the most dramatic transformation in the global world ,
India , China , and anyone else in the country
communications allows them to work with our companies --
We should look at the most important technological trends today .
because _UNK_ believed that this might be the most exciting moment in our life .
because we &apos;re talking about the technology that we &apos;re talking about .
And of course , there are all kinds of _UNK_ around the world ,
And we also have a president in the world ,
and realize that the world is not just a _UNK_ ,
But we need to combine with the world in a new way .
from literally , all of the people in this room
You &apos;re a _UNK_ . You see the human nature
the most beautiful picture of the _UNK_ .
whether you work or live in that country ,
You should all meet the limits that we can afford ,
is the best way to save people from poverty ,
On the one hand , there are people who think
The aid system has been _UNK_ , so we can abandon it .
On the other hand , it was thought that
And what I want to talk about is a _UNK_ of both sides .
The _UNK_ pointed out that since the 1970s
But the current situation is just the _UNK_ of the environment .
And the other side , as I said , some people are saying ,
They wanted to help the poor population out of poverty ,
But the problem is that both sides are _UNK_ .
I know , on this planet , there &apos;s no individual
They will _UNK_ back to poverty , sometimes even a few generations .
is to know the capital of local _UNK_
and you can &apos;t think of low income groups as a negative _UNK_ ,
and the people who want to know their fate .
to allow local _UNK_ to have enough time
to make the market become our best listening facility ,
to increase the profits of the global economy ,
where people make a chunk , two pieces or three pieces a day .
And what they decided was that they were all about the paid class .
to the country , this is a new thing .
and experience a lot of _UNK_ therapy and visual aid ,
This _UNK_ needs to rely on many management aid .
the low income people contact the industrial model ,
to establish a relationship between sincerity and _UNK_ .
He has been a _UNK_ experience in the world for 20 years .
and just _UNK_ the depression of these low income ,
The maximum of the day can be _UNK_ a dollar .
_UNK_ is a small amount of water
to turn into the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
But the market again _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the low income .
and because this system is designed for large land .
So Amy _UNK_ decided that he was going to take this innovation
because he had been listening for years ,
It needs to be enough to make the _UNK_
Because the risk of _UNK_ will be too high .
And that means that the risk of taking
And the third thing is , Amy _UNK_ called
The _UNK_ can be profit from the first ? _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
In fact , when you go to the beginning ,
is going to be the most important thing in the world
the most dangerous market classes in the world
is that income is less than one dollar people ,
and it &apos;s the biggest agriculture aspect of risk .
So he needed the _UNK_ . He took this big deal
and even more aware how to push this object to farmers ,
And we helped him build a knowledge on _UNK_ .
and all the other capital that we use .
Secondly , we can imagine if we can
_UNK_ the new system to export to other countries .
So we met with Dr. _UNK_ in Pakistan .
After a while , we were able to and have been in Pakistan
is to build a company that is a company .
we can start to see these things happening in the world .
The common building is a _UNK_ worker , most of the women &apos;s plants .
is the _UNK_ _UNK_ Fund and the Indian administration .
Because it &apos;s extremely successful , it creates 35 days a day
And the _UNK_ is going to decide
And because of cooperation , it was also a scale .
They just signed four contracts to build 100 new ambulance ,
and became the biggest and most efficient thing in India .
_UNK_ . And I talked about the total of these companies
He has recently _UNK_ a social innovation fund
And I suggest that _UNK_ is a place
that can contribute to innovation in the world .
the opportunity to create the global innovation fund .
The United States is not necessarily a _UNK_ partner .
but I need to make a statement again .
If we take the idea of the global innovation Fund ,
It &apos;s not going to be directly invested government , even if we could get government _UNK_ ,
She founded the largest credit bank in her country ,
And she &apos;s a real model for women , whether she &apos;s in the country or in this country .
I &apos;ve invested seven years in Pakistan for six years ,
can prove that _UNK_ is a very _UNK_ job .
and they all have a very _UNK_ nature .
the social community , the _UNK_ of the society ,
When we think about how to build aid for Pakistan ,
We need to think about the things that are going to increase
can be a role in the world as an influential force .
I asked Dr. _UNK_ if I could take me to see
Some of the _UNK_ systems already established in the desert .
I could see a lonely line from the horizon .
The scene was more clear when we entered the room .
There was a _UNK_ group of seven feet high .
so that he could change his fate .
He said this was the first _UNK_ in his life ,
to make a business farm for about one day .
and the money he used to make him not move this year .
and since the three generations of the world ,
We asked him that he would not treat her daughter and son .
( I know ) the dignity of human spirit is more important than wealth .
and see how many different areas of the world
But I think this generation may be the first time
There is courage to _UNK_ love and power .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to think about .
to build the global economy of the world ,
and also includes us , we have to have it .
to _UNK_ all of the human beings on the planet .
The time of _UNK_ cooperation in new ways is coming .
and the product and the services of millions of _UNK_
to a group of people on this planet .
But I also learned a lot of other innovations .
So I asked you , whatever you &apos;re working in that field ,
to get a solution to the problem .
but not what we need to think about .
I would _UNK_ the world with my arms .
so that we live in generous and responsible
But there are lots of nice things in the world to try to find out .
Let us recall those _UNK_ in the desert , the strong _UNK_ .
because I &apos;m going to talk to you about my thoughts , standing on this stage ,
and Al Gore . When he campaign , I voted for the first time in my life ,
I was getting more and more nervous
I didn &apos;t think Chris would sit on the stage
I thought that my father and my grandfather
Chris mentioned me and my husband set up a company
I want to do some slides as an auxiliary object .
But I saw some of the great talks yesterday
This is my grandmother , and my mouth came from her genetic .
Someone wrote a blog about how the man talked about _UNK_ .
or how do you use a pen
It was _UNK_ , and the _UNK_ had to adjust their burglar locks .
It &apos;s not a _UNK_ printer , but it &apos;s in the Word of Word .
The blogs are terrible , and you might think that
And on the stage , I had to say that blogs were really awful .
They change the way we look at the media ,
Some good examples . Some blogs are fascinated by thousands of readers .
that people can write blog on the _UNK_ ,
And he &apos;s going to be able to do this now .
Or some of the institutions , for example , a _UNK_ ,
to have someone who needs to do the _UNK_
I &apos;m talking about myself . I &apos;m a _UNK_ . This is me .
I &apos;ve always been trying to become an expert
So , I started writing blog in 2001 , and I was 23 years old .
At college I read English professional , but there was no use for my work .
So I miss writing , and I began to write blogs
I first wrote a little story at the beginning .
This is a picture of what happened when I was 11 years old .
to go to a Christian _UNK_ camp .
And they couldn &apos;t find me in a way
And although they &apos;re made of _UNK_ , I don &apos;t know how to hear it .
When I started writing blog , I had a goal
I can try to be famous for the Web ,
I &apos;ll have a goal . I said , I &apos;m going to win the prize .
because I didn &apos;t have a prize in my life .
I &apos;m going to win the prize for this .
Well , I win . I &apos;m in contact with _UNK_ .
thousands of people read my daily life every day .
And one time I wrote something about _UNK_ ,
300 dollars , and it &apos;s kind of expensive .
I might have heard Steve Jobs played it .
I said to my husband , &quot; Ben , can I _UNK_ ? &quot; He said , &quot; No . &quot;
This is my husband , and it &apos;s pretty nice .
He was so _UNK_ that I couldn &apos;t buy this _UNK_ .
The people who knew I was playing a joke
And so _UNK_ , I like to make people laugh ,
because the joke is that this man is not a _UNK_ .
If he knew that I was showing these pictures
And he would kill me , and he would have killed me
The question is , I wrote this piece , my friends read it .
And they thought , &quot; Well , that was the _UNK_
to make _UNK_ , to write the foolish thing .
&quot; Oh my God , your husband is _UNK_ .
How much money did he drink every year ?
You can buy a _UNK_ with a beer ,
I was 17 years old . We never separate the bank account .
And I think , who are they all ?
I realized that I didn &apos;t want to have the reader
I don &apos;t want to write things for the public ,
I don &apos;t want to write it again .
and it &apos;s going to write some personal experiences
And I wrote this piece because Einstein
My first pet , I think I &apos;m kind of _UNK_ ,
I decided to break myself and say , &quot; I don &apos;t want to write my life anymore . &quot;
because I wanted to think about her
These are my personal experiences . You can read about political blogs
or about media , or some gossip topic , etc .
But I was still interested in the personal experiences
You see _UNK_ &apos;s work , the art critic ,
But these things are not elegant to us .
If you &apos;re talking about blogs , you think about the elegant art blog ,
that are famous for the history of the Bible
And these normal stories are just telling me their stories .
It was normal one day , and the next day it was like hell .
These pictures were taken a day , the first day , the next day ,
On the ninth day , he _UNK_ his breath .
It &apos;s a real , very _UNK_ picture of you .
the heart slow down , and it doesn &apos;t predict
And then it &apos;s going to get better . _UNK_ , he &apos;s home .
It &apos;s not something you &apos;re going to see in the newspaper or magazine .
There &apos;s 28 comment , not a lot of people looking at
And he was taking him , because the boy was his son , it was not a change .
And the kids grew up in the middle
And he had so many treatment in the hospital
And in this era of the Internet ,
But I think that blogs are basically a development
is that your personal record is that
You can use _UNK_ search for who is _UNK_ .
you find some information , and you don &apos;t like it .
_UNK_ is a record of what people write every day .
not just the same topic , but the things they &apos;re interested in
We say the world is getting smaller and smaller .
Every time I talk about blogs , I want to connect more people
that millions of people in the world
We want to connect with people in China
But there &apos;s a lot of people who have
It &apos;s like 100 dollars a computer plan is great .
is because it &apos;s _UNK_ , and it &apos;s very simple .
And the reason I add this is because I know
I showed this picture , my mom always saw it a day .
And she would say , &quot; Why don &apos;t you have me ? &quot;
My mom is this guy . These are people I know .
and my family , and my family --
I &apos;m going to spend a few hours looking at the relationship
and said , &quot; Oh , that kid in the top is red .
It &apos;s not science , but I &apos;m interested in it .
I want to know how we are evolved .
about the _UNK_ record , which is my _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s a lot of people who call _UNK_
And this is the only message I have .
and their birthday , the age of age ,
They &apos;re in their home , and they &apos;re not talking about English .
And so many . I only know how many
There &apos;s only so many . I don &apos;t even know my mom &apos;s next relationship .
because she was _UNK_ , I couldn &apos;t figure out
I spent a lot of time in my life
And that &apos;s why my husband is a _UNK_ .
I was looking at the files in Washington
This is the only photograph I have .
Think about what we can do with blogs .
And those people talk about themselves , sharing their stories .
is a project done by a _UNK_ and his wife
He took pictures of his family basically every day .
And here &apos;s a little bit of a laugh ,
Do you see the math here ? I &apos;m glad I &apos;m going to go to 100
This is what they look like today , or last year .
how powerful it is to do that ,
I hope that our family can do that .
to do a little bit of a _UNK_ .
And since last year , I gave myself a _UNK_
There are few people looking at these pictures . I &apos;m not going to do it for the audience .
They would sometimes say to me , you don &apos;t have any update .
And maybe sometimes they would tell me
But the most amazing thing is that I can go back to the past
Look at what I &apos;m doing . And I &apos;ll remember it .
So the vision suggests that what we know every day
I remember , at the time , in Germany ,
And I was in the hotel room at the time .
I don &apos;t want to stay there . You can see
I &apos;m not _UNK_ every day . Now I know how to laugh
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
And that might be the most profound story
I may talk about half the _UNK_ , because every time the story is going to happen ,
Her name is Emma , and she &apos;s a _UNK_ .
She used our service , and she went to _UNK_
When we open it , she was one of the 100 _UNK_
She wrote how she could fight against cancer .
We all read her blog because there were few people
And she said , &quot; That &apos;s what she said .
And then her sister said to her blog
Emma passed away . We all supported her .
It was a very hard day in the company .
And it made me realize that it was
but you can talk about yourself as well .
There &apos;s a big impact on the planet
and her sister wrote to the _UNK_
Emma was writing her blog in the last few months of life .
It might be the best thing she had .
because you can talk to people and share her stories .
and how amazing it is to be .
to write a blog that was very comfortable .
The blog is not necessarily a terrible thing .
We don &apos;t always have to attack blogs
I &apos;m going to be able to print it up .
or I sent her family a _UNK_ file
And they came to the memory of the rituals
and she talked about her blog because the blog was an important part of her life .
And I want to talk to you about
Think about blogs , think about what they are .
Think about how you used to think about
The second largest fish in the ocean is _UNK_ .
with a warm muscle , like a _UNK_ sea ,
That &apos;s a _UNK_ tuna in the aquarium in _UNK_ .
You see the shape and its _UNK_ design
and it flies in the ocean and goes up and down ,
Most of the body is actually naked skin ,
In _UNK_ , we were able to catch fish in sustainable ways ,
And the way that the fish is now caught
But that &apos;s the question . We &apos;re going to have them to die !
Now in the Atlantic , the story is very simple .
The south is Europe , the _UNK_ tuna in North Africa .
in the last 10 years , almost 50,000 tons per year .
to the _UNK_ list of the _UNK_ species .
And all of the people in this room could recognize
But I suspect that no one had seen tuna _UNK_ .
a general problem that we have to do
It &apos;s the 21st century , but we know about the ocean .
It was just the beginning of the year .
We can look at the Earth in space ,
Most of us , including me , I think ,
In the face of the sea , there is a broad sea of water .
The seasonal power of the _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
It is difficult to say that sea work is difficult .
We &apos;re hard to _UNK_ tuna -- the entire Pacific .
It &apos;s really hard to get close to _UNK_
Imagine Bruce _UNK_ at the University of Ohio State ,
and on the top of it can say ,
And the main direction of our team is that
or the components that you have in your computer .
And it &apos;s going to be a way that &apos;s never been used .
to see that tuna are being underwater .
I &apos;ve been working with tuna for 15 years .
to show the tuna and the _UNK_ tuna .
We can see water exchange with the sea ,
We can see the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ and the action ,
We can make two million people a year
In the back of this beautiful picture , it &apos;s working with the Monterey Bay aquarium .
But first we have to learn to feed them .
We went into a tuna tank . We _UNK_ their naked skin .
And so we can actually study the _UNK_
and the rest of the fish are _UNK_ .
and put it into a _UNK_ tube ,
That tuna might think it would swim to Japan , but it actually stayed .
And when I saw tuna , it was my favorite picture .
How do these fish be solved before we solve _UNK_ ?
has taught us how to go out and continue studying the ocean .
It &apos;s like ballet , but it &apos;s hard to be beautiful .
to make it go out to four minutes
We let the water _UNK_ it , give it oxygen .
And then you give it a tag
And make sure that some of the _UNK_ can stay outside the country , make computers feel _UNK_ outside .
to put a satellite tag on a tuna
So , from the tag , you know , you know ,
is going to be able to get involved
The two electronic tags just mentioned are relatively expensive .
to give us a lot of help than other organizations .
And that was the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And here we &apos;re going to measure the fish .
We &apos;re going to do some of the things that we &apos;re starting to do
Look how smooth the skin , you can see my reflection .
From that _UNK_ , we can get the genes .
In my former _UNK_ , my former _UNK_ teacher ,
This is a beautiful picture of a tuna .
And this is a tuna in the digital ocean
The more cold is in the Gulf of _UNK_ .
This is a tuna line , and it _UNK_ in a variety of different ways .
But when it &apos;s warm , tuna are going to eat fish .
And it was cold and went back to North Carolina
And then I was the favorite scene , three tuna came back to the Gulf .
They come together , and maybe to reproduce the next generation .
The data produced by this 15 - year tag .
Now , let &apos;s look at them at the west .
One is the Gulf community that we tagged ,
They go to the Gulf , and we can see
They go to the Gulf , and we can see
and I went back to the Mediterranean ,
in the middle of the city in _UNK_
like the Gulf and the Mediterranean of _UNK_
And this is obviously what should be protected .
In the middle of the Atlantic , the population is mixed up .
In the middle of the Atlantic , the population is mixed up .
And we need to do it for a while .
And so there &apos;s a possibility to protect the tuna
And we made a team of people
we &apos;re going to be able to do our projects
It &apos;s going to start _UNK_ a lot of _UNK_ fish .
In _UNK_ , California marks a head of _UNK_
to put a salmon in front of the shark .
we can get sharks out of the ground
This shark is a cousin of the shark .
and put a tube in it and it doesn &apos;t touch the deck .
Now , the satellite is moving towards it .
The shark jump in the water , and if you look carefully at it , you can see its _UNK_ .
This is a shark that has the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
But this is just showing that it &apos;s exactly the _UNK_ of the meter .
More warm color represents the temperature of the sea .
Now in Monterey , the top of the _UNK_
In a moment , a curious _UNK_ would be _UNK_ .
Soon he was caught on our 16 feet long boat .
So , the result of the _UNK_ can see two markers .
This is the _UNK_ of California in California .
to the _UNK_ and come back and forth .
We can see that _UNK_ and _UNK_ are moving in ten days .
And the _UNK_ of tuna has been done .
We chose some young tuna that we had ,
is going to have the tag on the sensors
The tag will stick on their heads , when they _UNK_ the skin .
They flew to Monterey and went to Monterey ,
And the first thing that we do is that
Now , you see George _UNK_ and a team from _UNK_ .
we can see from the ocean that moves ,
where the predator is going to be .
What you see here is just three years of data
And what we can do is we use these data
And this is the first time that it tells us
And then , like they give us the _UNK_ ,
to collect data in the water in 2000 meters .
in the critical places like the Antarctic , the Arctic .
We can &apos;t figure out how to do the best _UNK_ of these data .
to make the public participation in a very important place .
And what we did for the Big _UNK_
We can put the _UNK_ on a big _UNK_ ,
and sharks are coming from California to Hawaii .
that we can &apos;t see anywhere in the world .
We have technology to understand where it is .
What we need to think about is how to increase
and eventually we can get information at home ,
the links that come from the blue whale
It &apos;s very exciting to see sharks in the _UNK_ Bridge .
and the iPhone will be connected to this activity .
This is a picture of some of the Internet .
when I introduce myself to being an artist ,
They looked at me and said , &quot; Do you draw ? &quot;
or &quot; What are you working in the media ? &quot;
And most of my work is going to work
is a way to work on the way
What I really interested in is to create the problem
I met a little bit of trouble a few years ago .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about this .
This is the airport in Detroit in June of 2002 .
I just went back to the United States
And one of the things that we call
and asked me a lot of questions --
&quot; Where are you going ? What are you going to do ?
Why do you go there ? Who pays for your journey ? &quot;
And the guy asked me , &quot; Where are you going to do ? &quot;
Most of us are asked , &quot; Where are you going to do this ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t remember , let me go to _UNK_ . &quot;
and said , &quot; Let me go to the _UNK_ of September 12 . &quot;
I looked -- _UNK_ to 10 and a half , I _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ to the afternoon , to the door to class .
and at six o &apos;clock in the afternoon , at the top level ,
&quot; Where are you going ? &quot; Where are you going ? &quot;
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s not expecting me to have that detailed detail
&quot; The _UNK_ that you rent is a _UNK_
I said , &quot; In Florida , the winter clothes in Florida
and put the furniture in the room
He _UNK_ me and said , &quot; No _UNK_ ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Of course , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m not going to have a bomb .
If I had it , I would certainly remember it . &quot;
I think any one of these people and I _UNK_
After about a half hours of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I &apos;ll transfer the office to _UNK_ , and they &apos;re _UNK_ them .
They will take over and we will be responsible . &quot;
I was in the middle of the _UNK_
And you know , in the United States ,
I &apos;ve got a lot of time to do this .
&quot; Have you ever seen or participate in anything
Maybe it &apos;s going to hurt America or other countries ? &quot;
And the answer to these questions is that
or the question -- the _UNK_ problem --
They asked me that I was nine _UNK_ --
The first one is , &quot; Are you in _UNK_ ? &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Are we in _UNK_ ? &quot; Yes . &quot; What &apos;s Tuesday ? &quot; Yes ? &quot;
because it &apos;s going to let you answer the question .
&quot; Do you belong to any _UNK_ organization in the United States ? &quot;
I said , &quot; You might have to ask my colleagues . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Well , no matter what we &apos;re talking about ,
Are you in any organization that wants to harm the United States ? &quot;
And in the next six months of this ,
I said , &quot; No , this is what I &apos;ve been telling you about ,
And I thought , &quot; Well , I just want to do that all over the country .
He said , &quot; What are you going to have ?
to give me a call -- we &apos;ll get it done . &quot;
Since then , I would call the phone to the _UNK_ .
I told them , &quot; I &apos;m going to leave , this is my flight ,
A few weeks later , I &apos;ll call them again .
Not that I was forced to do that , but I chose it .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to do anything to do . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want you to think I &apos;m going to get away .
And so I &apos;ve been doing it all the time .
and the email becomes more and longer --
I built a website that allows us to look at this .
to track my particular moment of journey ,
I decided that you &apos;re not going to look at me , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t have to waste the resources
And so I started thinking , what do they know ?
So I decided to put all the flight records
This is a couple of meals I eat on the plane .
_UNK_ , they don &apos;t let you take this knife .
But they gave you this on the plane
This is some of the airports that I &apos;ve gone to .
But if you cross it with other data ,
you can think of as a secret agent .
that every single single second of the activity
you &apos;re in a state of life in a completely different way .
And I thought , &quot; The Art Project , &quot;
not to think , &quot; Ah , I have a new job . &quot;
But through this experience , you know what happened ,
And this is a way to explore self
These are some shops that I &apos;ve been shopping .
And there I bought some of the _UNK_
And there &apos;s a _UNK_ that was bought in _UNK_ --
This is the Hong Kong _UNK_ on the _UNK_ .
I added a _UNK_ of oil from _UNK_ .
so that I can &apos;t do that , but I can give information
And it gave me the evidence that I really did
And the point is that there &apos;s a cross reference .
This is directly extracted from my bank account ,
This is my old apartment in San Francisco
Sometimes it &apos;s just a _UNK_ corridor in the Salt Lake .
I can tell people about the people who are ,
because I had to do that for a second .
And I had to tell them that every detail
I spent a lot of time on the road
And there &apos;s a lot of time in the gas station --
and there are hundreds of photos of people
I &apos;ve got a picture on this website . I &apos;ve got a _UNK_ picture .
_UNK_ had seen all the pictures --
At least I believe that they all seen
And sometimes there is no information about it .
There &apos;s a lot of text , but there &apos;s no picture of it .
This is my favorite little _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
These are the meal I did at home .
How do you know that these are dinner at home ?
because the dish had been repeated a lot of times
You have to do a little bit of a detective job .
It was this afternoon , and it was this evening .
is directly handed to my service _UNK_ ,
They wanted to know what I was doing .
And it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ in the afternoon
In _UNK_ , my apartment was there in _UNK_
is a drop of information from the _UNK_ .
If you go to my website , it &apos;s a lot of this information .
And one of the reasons is that it &apos;s not possible
I &apos;m going to put all the information out there
means that I tell you all the things I &apos;ve done
I still live in a very private life .
What do you do when all the information is exposed ?
is a very different way of doing it .
And there &apos;s an interesting thing to do
is because there is no way to get it .
And the information that _UNK_ had had had was useful .
we &apos;re going to have a completely _UNK_ design .
because if everyone shared the information system , it was paralyzed .
&quot; Why do you want the world to know where you are ? &quot;
And this is when people didn &apos;t start with Twitter .
And in some sense , I &apos;m glad I was completely _UNK_ .
I was doing this project , but it was completely _UNK_ .
And this is what we do every day .
We &apos;re creating the files that we &apos;re creating .
And some of my friends in this room
&quot; Why do you always do these things ?
and looked at the log through the server ,
It &apos;s just these pieces , and you can see something
I &apos;m going to reduce the list and you can see
You can see the land _UNK_ like to visit here .
And there &apos;s also a national security agency ,
I actually moved to a very near place where I lived with them .
I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re asking , but they come .
I think they might love the art of art
I &apos;m glad we have the _UNK_ of that field .
And you say , &quot; Everything &apos;s automatically coming from my iPhone . &quot;
But how do you take a picture and send information ?
How long does it take to spend every day ?
just as we don &apos;t have to do that before .
we don &apos;t think about how much time it takes .
So basically , I &apos;m just going to put a little bit on the machine .
BG : If you can &apos;t track the area , _UNK_ will blow up ?
_UNK_ : Can I find some of the final things
you can see the last airport that I left ,
You should all know what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I think _UNK_ can cause social _UNK_ and _UNK_
We can get the same social , the equality of society ,
and the data is actually going to be connected .
But first of all , let &apos;s see how many of our lives are .
Their wealth is twice the country of Israel , Greek , _UNK_ .
but it doesn &apos;t affect the average life of their country .
These are all the town of England and Wales --
The poorest in the right , the richest ones on the left .
There is a big difference between poor and other people .
the same data as the World Bank --
It &apos;s easy to understand , and you can download it ,
You can see the world on the left --
that 20 percent of their wealth is about 20 percent later .
And I &apos;m going to show you what &apos;s going to happen to our society .
The marks of one country are the average factors .
with what I showed in the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to show you the data over and over again .
So we also published a story about the British Medical _UNK_ .
It includes whether children can talk to their parents ,
How many _UNK_ are , and whether the school is _UNK_ .
This is the index of the same _UNK_ .
If you look at the benefits of the child ,
I &apos;m going to show you all of the data revealed
and the location of the other person &apos;s position .
And I &apos;m going to show you some branch of our index .
And if you look at the social activity ,
I &apos;m going to say that we repeat the job twice .
And the first time for these wealthy countries ,
over 50 states in the United States --
This is the federal government in a general social survey .
that we can compare every single single _UNK_
The ratio of psychology is three times the rest of the society .
And this is the ratio of prisoners .
but more serious trials are going to be ,
the more it tends to retain death penalty .
This is a graph of high school in children .
is that the gap is really serious .
I know there are many American people here --
And what I &apos;ve shown here is _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And I can show you some other problems .
the problems that are more common to us .
but it &apos;s going to be twice as many as 10 times .
I want to go back to this earlier graph
It &apos;s not just a couple of _UNK_ problems ,
And the other thing I want to point out
They all showed that they were very different countries .
First of all , Japan &apos;s salary gap is relatively small .
Some states have better performance through the _UNK_ ,
how to achieve a bigger equality is not important ,
What I say is that in the rich developed world democracy .
It seems to be a little bit more _UNK_
We can compare it by a series of studies
And every one of the people in the society
according to the _UNK_ of the average social economy ,
Some _UNK_ have _UNK_ a lot of baby deaths .
The middle is the _UNK_ of the technology ,
Here you can see that Sweden is better than British ,
The biggest difference appears at the bottom of the society .
We showed that five different kinds of data
and it seems like the _UNK_ --
The more equality society shows the highest difference in society ,
I should explain how to do it .
more focused on the superior _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
and the feeling of the competition of identity
We &apos;re more worried about how people judge and see us ,
And of course , some of you have this _UNK_ ,
when people criticized us to pick up data ,
If our _UNK_ contains the data of the countries ,
And of course , there are more complex ways in literature
It &apos;s true that people are connected to our results .
is because people are not very sensitive to themselves .
I think we have to make our _UNK_
is that we can reduce our income gap
But if you just do what he says ,
But I actually didn &apos;t mean that , in fact ,
I don &apos;t think what it &apos;s going to do with it .
My life is in the exploration of _UNK_ .
My core is to make beautiful and fun .
This is _UNK_ , which is made by _UNK_ .
It &apos;s really fun to have a family in my house .
but I put it on the aisle instead of making orange juice .
I saw a slip of paper as soon as I opened the packing .
and you don &apos;t use that machine to do juice .
So I took a jar of juice in this machine .
And then I came up with this photograph
So , let &apos;s see how beautiful it is .
and it had a sharp blade that was very easy .
You know , I &apos;ve got a theory of emotions
_UNK_ and his colleagues did this in MIT Media Lab .
They found a _UNK_ and put a projector on it .
The projector _UNK_ a surface through the projector .
you play a tennis ball and you play a table
there &apos;s a _UNK_ that goes out and around and around .
And then the ball goes up and down to another place
And again , it &apos;s really sad to see the _UNK_ .
If you search for the _UNK_ design ,
And Google is so ingenious to rip his logo ,
It &apos;s just getting you to see a lot of &quot; _UNK_ , and every one is called _UNK_ .
I think many of you have seen it , but not noticed
And the unconscious noticed that this thing was kind of happy .
My website is the first one in the top search results .
Google will tell me that you don &apos;t need to play &quot; with words . &quot;
There was a comment on the New York Times .
This is a car that &apos;s full of _UNK_ .
If you look at the interior of the car ,
I wanted to rent a car at the time .
This is a picture of my son driving .
And the design of the car is a joy .
And this is my little _UNK_ about fun .
I really think the fun thing is always going together .
I &apos;m going to put a board on the floor .
Imagine I had a sandwich of two feet wide .
I can move on the board and make a panic .
I can jump back and jump back and forth .
And if I &apos;m going to put this board in 300 feet ,
I &apos;m not going to go closer to it .
And _UNK_ said that at the end of his speech ,
He felt very nervous until the last few days before he began to calm down .
But that anxiety that leads him to work .
They can focus on the world instead of _UNK_ .
But some people can do it for instance , such as _UNK_ ,
It was a empty room with a table table .
This is a IQ test that you can test in real life .
The student took the rope and put it out to the other hand .
I want to tell you that there &apos;s a box of sugar here , but I don &apos;t eat sugar .
The students love to be happy in the room .
Maybe it &apos;s fun at least to make them feel better .
your brain &apos;s nerves are going to accelerate so you can focus on
When you feel happy , when you feel happy ,
you can easily be _UNK_ by the outside world and you &apos;re thinking about
And every storm you feel happy you &apos;re going to play games .
But if you look at this time , you don &apos;t do anything .
because you &apos;ll be working in half a minute and say , &quot; Yes , I can do it with a new way ! &quot;
So you need a schedule to do good work .
When you &apos;re happy , you get more creative .
and you &apos;re going to think I &apos;ll find a way to solve it .
a kind of information processing that is _UNK_ .
Look at the evolution of life is the color of our people .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ like fruit in the _UNK_ .
The brain of the human brain is shaped by evolution .
You can express emotions in a different way .
like the choice of choice of color in _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a very old car that &apos;s always bad .
It was collected by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City .
You can see that the jar is rather rather rather than in the water .
They don &apos;t throw the jar out of the tank
And they put it down , and as decoration ,
Or again , it &apos;s not the glamour of water .
The second layer is the level of behavior .
Most of the things we live are making .
I walked on the stage and didn &apos;t follow my feet .
I was talking to most of the time .
I &apos;ve done a lot of preparation before I &apos;ve done it .
The nature of behavior is to make the user feel that everything is in control .
and you feel that everything is going to be _UNK_
you feel that everything is in your own control .
And these holes are also a little _UNK_
you can stand there for a couple of hours
And this is a very intricate _UNK_ .
I was buying a lot of money in Chicago .
but you need to put it in the desktop
tea will be _UNK_ by the right side of the _UNK_ .
is on the right side of this line .
There &apos;s a _UNK_ of tea in this place .
and the water _UNK_ up and down .
When tea is already _UNK_ , you can put the _UNK_ a little bit _UNK_ .
You should remember that tea is in this position .
and the emotions are going to be _UNK_
the cognitive meaning is to understand the world and to explain the world
that we &apos;re going to act on muscle activity .
We can tell the feelings of other people .
And our facial expression was a special _UNK_ .
because it &apos;s going to send a signal to the waiter . You see I &apos;m standing . &quot;
And the waiter will come up and ask , &quot; _UNK_ need more water . &quot;
That &apos;s part of the brain that can &apos;t control your behavior .
that you can &apos;t control your sensory senses .
or &quot; Why do you do that ? I don &apos;t know . &quot;
And that &apos;s what consciousness is going to be .
The owner once said , &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot of cars in my life . &quot;
but never a car made me think of myself .
If you decide to buy this car is the only way you care about it .
Even at first a few cars will be very expensive .
or a very expensive watch you can show up
They would say , &quot; How do I know you have a watch ? &quot;
It &apos;s probably going to be a bit better than that .
And when you use a sense of compassion , it looks more interesting .
you get a hint of &quot; This is safe , although you &apos;re assured . &quot;
If the game is rusty and _UNK_ believe you won &apos;t go there .
And it lost a ball that was missing .
It &apos;s trying to take a look at the _UNK_ back .
And the most amazing thing is that you believe that
because I looked at the files in this room ,
You know that all of you come from a different context .
_UNK_ , and all of us are together
with each other , build the network , and I want to tell you ,
I want to go from a very specific aspect
In the only 20 minutes , I &apos;m going to ask _UNK_ content .
to contribute to power or help me do my work .
in the remote part is not just one .
And of course , it &apos;s often going to be
The more you go , then you get to the more distant areas .
in the big cities around the world ,
are all in the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ ,
The relative cities are more _UNK_ and are rich and _UNK_ .
We did a guess . This is the prediction .
Even if the school is too difficult to keep these teachers ;
I &apos;d like to test whether this is in line with the truth . So last year ,
A route from New Delhi to the northern part of India .
And the road doesn &apos;t go through any _UNK_ ,
or the center of the city . We went 300 kilometers away ,
Every time we find a school , we have a standard test ,
is going to test the results of the test .
This is a very interesting picture , of course , you need a carefully carefully _UNK_ .
I mean , this is just a very small sample ; we can &apos;t afford it .
And on the line that I chose ,
The more remote school , the results of the tests are _UNK_ .
I tried to connect with some factors , like infrastructure ,
or the power supply and so on .
and the test results are the number of people
the infrastructure that are going to work on ,
There is no difference in poverty . There is no relationship .
Later , I made a questionnaire in every school .
The questionnaire only asked the teacher a question :
Would you like to move to the city ?
From this graph , the _UNK_ made a certain answer ,
The teacher said it would be a bit closer to Delhi ,
And for the wealthy suburbs of Delhi , the _UNK_ said ,
Because , you know , the conditions of the _UNK_ are relatively good .
And then , in the area of Delhi , the answer is always _UNK_ .
I can imagine that a teacher walked into the classroom ,
And every day I was looking forward to myself as a better school ,
This is likely to influence the quality of teaching .
_UNK_ , the teachers &apos;s work and the _UNK_ flow
to whether or not it &apos;s going to be ,
is that the number of people in the class
It looks like it &apos;s going to look like this .
When I talk about education and technology , I read it in the data ,
you &apos;re listening to every morning in the morning --
always in the best school , or the best school in town , the test is done .
These data -- some of them are scientific works ,
The teachers often say , well , but the cost of education is too low .
because the fact that students were able to get
So for example , 80 percent of the population
After using this new technology , they can make _UNK_ points .
If you use the same technology in those remote areas ,
to get the score from _UNK_ to _UNK_ , like _UNK_ ,
And so , this is what the education technology is ,
The effect on the bottom of the pyramid is more notable than the top .
But we are not going to be opposite .
So I came up with this : education technology
And the final question is , how do you change the idea of teachers ?
When you show a teacher a new technology ,
You can &apos;t use a machine to replace teachers -- absolutely impossible .
I don &apos;t know why it &apos;s possible , but it &apos;s not ,
Even if you think it &apos;s impossible -- I &apos;d like to quote _UNK_ ,
He was a science fiction writer in Sri Lanka ,
He answered the question with the words of his speech .
He said that if a teacher is better than a machine , it should be replaced .
This gives the teachers a alarm and you have to worry about it .
In short , I think we need a _UNK_ education ,
It &apos;s a way to meet all these needs , to help without school ,
There is no shortage of resources in schools ,
or the quality of teachers is not good enough to deal with all kinds of situations .
If you &apos;re in the area that doesn &apos;t fit the above ,
So far , I &apos;ve only seen a place where I &apos;m not talking about .
Anyway , in this place , someone told me that there &apos;s no question here ,
It &apos;s true , but -- I never mentioned it in other places .
and a series of experiments that are going to happen
I have to go through it . This is a series of experiments .
The first experiment was done in 1999 in New Delhi .
And the work that we have here is very simple .
I was sitting next to a city _UNK_ ,
The office and the _UNK_ _UNK_ across the _UNK_ .
the name of the hole in the wall --
In the cave , a powerful PC is mounted on the wall of the wall .
And the monitor came out of the other side of the wall ,
computer links with high - speed Internet , with web browser ,
connected the popular website at the time -- and then _UNK_ .
That &apos;s my office . That &apos;s the hole in the wall .
The kid on the right is eight years old --
The girl next to him was six years old .
He &apos;s teaching her how to look at the pages .
The situation was not _UNK_ , but it raised more new questions .
How long does this computer store store ? Can they _UNK_ it ?
And the last question is to ask us ,
They must turn their heads on the other side of the wall .
Can you teach me how to work , then someone will teach them .
So , I left Delhi , and I did the same experiment .
This time we came to the central city of India .
I &apos;ve heard that all the local people are _UNK_ .
It was a hot day , &quot; The holes in the wall &quot;
to the old _UNK_ in that _UNK_ . This is the first child .
He _UNK_ at school when he was 13 years old .
He walked over and began to touch the _UNK_ .
Soon , he noticed that when his fingers _UNK_ on the _UNK_ ,
And then he told me that I never had a chance
He figured out the rule . It took two minutes ,
He understood that he was in control of the television .
And when he was there , he hit the hook .
_UNK_ -- you can see it on the screen .
He click the _UNK_ , and the net browser changes the pages .
And after eight minutes , he looked at the screen ,
And he &apos;s looking at the pages : _UNK_ .
And then he began to _UNK_ the kids ,
The kids come up and come up and forth .
In the evening , there were 70 children on the Internet .
And we came up with this conclusion :
to be self - teaching . But what kind of conditions do it need ?
Now , our main problem is in English .
Some people say you should have a _UNK_ version of computer and network ,
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to take the whole Internet
So , you have to figure out another way .
We &apos;re going to see how these kids can &apos;t overcome the problem of English .
Now , I don &apos;t know what to say , no English teacher ,
The children here don &apos;t know any English at all .
different _UNK_ in the city , in this village ,
to see more girls in the wall than boys .
And in the city , the _UNK_ usually hide far too far .
I put some CD on the computer -- there &apos;s no connection network --
I came back and saw these two children .
An eight - year - old , they play games with computers .
And they saw me and they said ,
&quot; We need a faster processor and a better mouse . &quot;
How did they figure out what was going on ?
They said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to learn from CD . &quot;
And I asked , but how do you understand what it means ?
It only shows English that we have to learn English .
And then I count , they &apos;re about two hundred English words , you teach me ,
like _UNK_ , stop , find , save , these _UNK_ ,
They use it not only when they play computers , but also use them in everyday conversation .
In _UNK_ , children seem to be _UNK_ , language is not a barrier .
They actually have the ability to study new languages ,
And finally , I gave enough money to do this experiment ,
Look at the same results in other places .
India is a good place to do this experiment ,
because we &apos;ve gathered the diversity of national diversity ,
So , I can figure out how to represent
I spent the last five years on this experiment ,
and took us all the corners of India .
Here is the _UNK_ mountain , in the north , frozen .
I have to find or develop a rational layout ,
It allows me to adapt all kinds of outdoor conditions ,
I need to do experiments with all kinds of climate , India just _UNK_ me ,
because we have cold weather , and we have very hot climate .
Here is the western desert , close to Pakistan &apos;s border .
Here &apos;s a little clip -- one of the villages --
The first thing that these kids do is to find a website
This is a _UNK_ in the middle of India , where climate is hot ,
It was possible that the electronic equipment had failed .
In the absence of air conditioning , the power supply is poor ,
And finally , we use a fan of fan
as the power of the machine to work .
I want to make a long story . We &apos;ve done the same experiment all over the place .
This is a great experiment . This is a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
It is _UNK_ to teach the children of their ages .
What is it ? We found six to 13 years old ,
Once they put computers in front of them , they can teach themselves , including intelligence information .
I couldn &apos;t find any reason , but I knew it had to happen in the group .
This is a great advantage for this group .
Now you see what a group of kids can do ,
We use the standard data statistics technology , and there &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ here .
It was almost identical to the study of students in school .
because it &apos;s all over here , isn &apos;t it ?
and learn to use computers and all their operations .
In fact , a child is working on computers ,
and tell him what he should do .
If you test them , the four children get the same score , no matter what to answer .
and the other 16 children around the world
and they tested it in the same way .
So , they learned the same thing through _UNK_ .
living in a society where they make decisions ,
He will look carefully at how adults take the whisky .
He could answer every question about the subject .
They seem to have been able to learn quickly .
So , what &apos;s going to tell us about this six years ?
It tells us that primary education can be done through _UNK_ ,
or at some point it &apos;s like this .
It doesn &apos;t have to work on the ground .
that can be achieved by a system of independence ,
And that &apos;s the second thing I want to talk about ,
Children can achieve a goal through self - learning .
And the third point and values , the simple one ,
I &apos;ve done a test for more than 500 children in India .
I asked them -- they were about 68 .
They answer all kinds of things : right , wrong , or I don &apos;t know .
There are some places , _UNK_ &apos;s questions , and the other answer is wrong ,
And I found the answer to the 16 sentence .
Some places have some _UNK_ about values .
A very typical question is that sometimes _UNK_ are necessary .
They can &apos;t answer the question ; they can &apos;t answer it .
But in the moment , as long as science develops ,
There are more examples of _UNK_ , market stocks ,
We should first introduce education in remote areas ,
The values are learned ; the principle of being _UNK_ --
put these four words on a -- I think --
It allows us to create a goal for education , a vision :
And that &apos;s _UNK_ , automation , allows you to make mistakes ,
As a _UNK_ , we never ask education ; we &apos;re just borrowing technology .
The slide is a very good education technology ,
But it was _UNK_ to education , and it was intended to do meetings .
We took it . And we bought the video conference and personal computer .
I think education is a vision that has itself ,
I have some of these _UNK_ . In this simple way ,
that these _UNK_ should be able to make
I gave it a name -- it &apos;s called the _UNK_ system .
Can we use it as the future of educational technology ?
I &apos;d like to leave it to do the decision .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m gray and black clothes ,
And I had to take my wife
I always wanted to be a pilot when I was a kid .
And my dream was to be a pilot .
I went to the Royal Air Force test ,
And it &apos;s easy for me to do that ,
because in my childhood , I had this long passion ,
and the Soviet Union and the United States
So I was very early in the morning ,
I , one day , announced this idea with my parents --
My father &apos;s not now admitted to this story --
I said , &quot; Dad , I want to be a _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; _UNK_ , you have to be special to be _UNK_ . &quot;
And there was 5,000 people in that year ,
It &apos;s a great job that I love to work every minute .
I bought a nice suit for _UNK_ , I wear shoes .
in Afghanistan after the _UNK_ of the Taliban .
about how we _UNK_ the base of Afghanistan ,
They had to have a series of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I was at the top of my career , and the fact that
as a British _UNK_ to the Security Council .
If you &apos;re interested , we can talk about it later --
to force it to _UNK_ these weapons .
My trip -- it &apos;s a very exciting thing .
It was the best time , and the worst time
I &apos;m a _UNK_ British _UNK_ in New York City ;
It was waiting for me to work in London .
In a certain way , I don &apos;t know why .
I decided to spend more time on other things
You can enjoy these special _UNK_ , and they say ,
But still belongs to a diplomatic service , it &apos;s just no specific job .
and took it to the United States in _UNK_ ,
to help me get to the next stage of life .
I &apos;ve been aware of the _UNK_ of Iraq and _UNK_
I _UNK_ the testimony of the survey three things :
It seems to be clear from the past five years .
And of course , our own assessment is clearly clear .
No threat to its neighboring country , no longer to say to us .
Secondly , the government neglected all possible alternatives to war ,
And I was stuck with my wife with torture ,
At last , I decided to resign from the Ministry of _UNK_ .
I felt -- like the _UNK_ movie , you might have seen that film ,
And they decided to make it very disappointing ,
And he said , &quot; You know , I can &apos;t do it again . It &apos;s not appropriate . &quot;
It &apos;s like me . I love that film .
or my Prime Minister , who was going to laugh ,
as I did before , I was glad to make them happy .
That feeling is very uncomfortable , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
But in a way , I &apos;ve been accustomed to this feeling .
than I was standing on the cliff ,
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to drink some water .
And that was , &quot; How do I spend my life ? &quot;
I expect my whole life is a _UNK_ , for example .
the people who get to the top of the business ,
a lot of my friends are still there .
all the provinces -- at the time -- _UNK_ --
The state of the _UNK_ is a terrible thing ,
to know how to do it --
the only way to stop the _UNK_ in the streets
And that &apos;s not a nice feeling , I &apos;ve seen it .
I &apos;ve been through it . I &apos;m personally in the _UNK_ .
With my _UNK_ friends , we tried to stop , we failed .
It &apos;s not obvious that it &apos;s a complex story .
One of the reasons why the _UNK_ is --
And those _UNK_ have been going on for a few days --
And there was a little bit about the future of _UNK_
the _UNK_ government , not to say _UNK_ people ,
The disturbance is part of the _UNK_ of depression .
I &apos;m not going to pretend that it &apos;s easier than the surface .
And that gave me a _UNK_ --
Why don &apos;t you help their governments in foreign countries ? &quot;
The _UNK_ did not allow a diplomatic service .
to help them deal with this incredibly complicated process ,
Later , this became the final status of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And that was the original idea of independence ,
And it started to be in London in _UNK_
I said to him after dinner with the Prime Minister of _UNK_ ,
&quot; Look , I proposed to give you a diplomatic advice .
I know this field . I &apos;m doing this . Why don &apos;t I help you ? &quot;
He raised his wine and said to me ,
_UNK_ eventually helped the three _UNK_ Prime Minister ,
on how you define them -- how do you define them --
We give North _UNK_ advise about how to _UNK_ its islands .
will be a new country in the next few years .
We give the advise of the West _UNK_ ,
We helped a lot of island _UNK_ climate change .
I went to the party of the English _UNK_ ,
I was holding the glass , but I met it .
I &apos;m going to set up a separate _UNK_ in New York City .
I was ready to go to New York City
He said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you come to see my colleagues in New York ? &quot;
He &apos;s called for a company ? If the innovation company works .
I began to realize that there &apos;s a lot of different ways to do diplomatic ,
although there is no innovation in diplomacy ;
and a couple of centuries of _UNK_ institutions
and the way they &apos;ve been dealing with things .
trying to get me ? If you &apos;re learning something about it ,
We were all in a office and the others in the room were noisy .
We all work on small laptops and try to change our thinking .
They may have no knowledge of our country ,
This is actually a good thing . I recommend it to you .
It &apos;s really good for you to do it in your life .
The second thing is that a bigger lesson in the world today .
That means that other things are rising .
They may be _UNK_ , and they may be good _UNK_ ,
We live in a world that is more complex .
And that means , who &apos;s going to face them in the future ,
Who &apos;s going to have a big responsibility to face them ?
If they don &apos;t do it , who will solve it ?
We have no choice ; we can only accept reality .
or anything that happened in _UNK_ had no relation to you ,
You can give them to the government to deal with it .
So what I &apos;m going to do is , but if you &apos;re _UNK_ , it &apos;s fun ,
This is actually proven by a case of another .
And that means that , in addition to your _UNK_ ,
You have to deal with the things you &apos;ve got to do .
_UNK_ is an example of this kind of thing .
There &apos;s no perfect example , but there &apos;s an example :
I &apos;ve been working in the past , and I &apos;ve changed it ,
They are non - governmental and non - governmental countries .
And when I look at the time of security ,
what we &apos;re trying to do in the Security Council
And you can count them all , and we visited them --
You don &apos;t talk to people who are directly related to them .
It makes you tell me -- you can tell them how they think about it .
You can think of these people all over your decision ,
so that your decision becomes the most effective , the most durable . &quot;
And I said , this idea is _UNK_ . Obviously , anybody can do it .
And of course , everybody knows . Everyone says , &quot; Yes , you &apos;re absolutely right .
And of course , nothing happened . No one did anything .
and I &apos;m going to use my _UNK_
And we have these meetings that we have .
at the conference on the Security Council .
We &apos;re going to take all the parties to New York City .
and I &apos;m going to talk about what they want ,
The Security Council is also going to talk about
Anyone who knows about politics knows that it &apos;s pretty difficult ,
I was a _UNK_ to me today ,
I think that the result is important , not the process ,
and all of the _UNK_ members of Iran
Look at the results , you will say to yourself ,
&quot; What do I do with the results of this ? &quot;
We like to watch television at least part of it .
I was just going to eat on TV .
but a lot of people don &apos;t like it .
and the profit of the television is _UNK_ .
Why do I believe that TV has a conscience ,
that the social and emotional needs to be
And today , we &apos;re not talking about television ,
which is the collective unconscious of the society .
and hunger , the rights of sexual rights ,
Why do TV entertainment develop in its way ?
to _UNK_ us at the same time ?
I want to say that this is an American sample .
more popular television programs in the United States
and the conscience is how we affect our everyday lives .
And the other way to publish data
I have to thank the TED community Hans _UNK_ .
to make us more positive in the world ,
But _UNK_ Reagan , the most popular President of _UNK_
What this graph is going to show is a very similar trend .
But in this table , there &apos;s a red dot --
and the social commentary has suddenly been _UNK_ .
In _UNK_ , the second and third television programme
And when you hear the term of this industry ,
I can do it through television on the Vietnam War .
And the last part of the world is
There &apos;s &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; _UNK_ and son , &quot;
40 years ago in the last 40 years
_UNK_ is just the data from the _UNK_ .
followed by the &quot; _UNK_ and &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot;
The _UNK_ of the three _UNK_ systems fell down .
the _UNK_ of humor in the 1990s --
As the advent of the new century , the Internet is popular .
to give me a little comfortable thing , my world _UNK_ .
I came to _UNK_ a American _UNK_ you were chop up .
in the last 50 years of pure entertainment
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s ,
And it was criticized by a Vice President _UNK_
Now I &apos;m not sure that the devil or the angels
But I know that I love this picture
If you think that you have a religious belief
Let me see . It &apos;s about four or four people
I didn &apos;t expect that there was so many _UNK_
Any kind of , any form . Please raise your hands .
And one of the main reasons for that ,
in some form it is beyond the spirit of something .
is that at some point , self - consciousness seems to disappear .
And we can use the _UNK_ and the decline
Now if you think about these abstract things that are possible
Think of it as a house with lots of rooms .
and they quote the words of different people .
He said he &apos;d met Jesus in the _UNK_ .
&#91; Video &#93; _UNK_ : I think I &apos;ve seen _UNK_ , the form of people
I felt so _UNK_ that I would like to die !
But I &apos;m longing for the entire human happiness ,
Many religions in the world have found a lot of different
Here is a mushroom that _UNK_ a man in straw .
At the same time , he was _UNK_ up by God .
But you don &apos;t have to rely on certain religions to help you climb up the stairs .
a lot of books about the war have mentioned the same thing .
And it opens a sense of power together .
_UNK_ was a soldier in World War II .
He interviewed a lot of other soldiers after the war .
and wrote a book about the men &apos;s _UNK_
because I &apos;m going to go forward and forward
JH : All of these examples are common features .
&quot; The concept of self &quot; seems to be _UNK_ or gone .
is completely different from the experience of our ordinary life .
And this kind of spirit is going to be
He compared a lower level of the world
In our normal life , we &apos;re going to live with individuals
The force of this organization is far bigger than those individuals .
And _UNK_ says this is the sacred level .
They would unite together to _UNK_ the world &apos;s forces .
And we all felt that we all _UNK_ together .
And the _UNK_ _UNK_ us from the secular level .
And we think we seem better and more noble .
Or this is a little fault in the entire system .
is that when the brain _UNK_ the blood vessels ,
There was a experience of religious faith in Jill &apos;s stroke .
A lot of scientists who have such ideas
and forced us to do all kinds of crazy religions .
So , for example , why are we going to have
They are always ready to help each other against each other .
And then he said , &quot; _UNK_ and _UNK_ people
But the idea of _UNK_ has been _UNK_ over the years .
But this idea will be &quot; _UNK_ &quot; this year .
particularly after biologists &apos; _UNK_ &apos; books published on April ,
You &apos;re going to compete between groups and groups .
This is a team of college _UNK_ ,
The most slow or _UNK_ _UNK_ will be eliminated .
Only a few people in these people will be elected to sports teams .
Maybe only one of them could march into the Olympic Games .
Once you put these people on a ship to compete with other fleet ,
Now , encourage groups to deal with that is _UNK_ .
But once there was a group of collaborators
is going to be used by a group of _UNK_ vehicles .
These people like to use the work of others
If we have a group of small _UNK_
Maybe it &apos;s bacteria , maybe it &apos;s _UNK_ , it &apos;s not .
Imagine the group of organizations evolved into a _UNK_ pattern
That &apos;s good . They &apos;ll fight each other and protect each other .
And they all get to each other and grow faster .
When they grow two times bigger , you see them split .
This is how they reproduce , how the numbers are added .
And one of these things is going to mutations in selfish direction .
So when you see green and blue communication ,
you find that green becomes bigger , blue blue blue .
But very quickly , these _UNK_ don &apos;t work .
In fact , nature has solved it many times .
Why is the _UNK_ of every cell in the cell
Maybe one _UNK_ another , we never know why .
and put them in a group of _UNK_ groups
But there are some new things in this field
This natural transformation is not a _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
Once a lot of _UNK_ were gathered in the same hive ,
They gathered on the stove or on the side of the stove .
They painted their own body and said their _UNK_
They &apos;re going to be able to work together
Of course , the _UNK_ of the human population
The human community is like the _UNK_ of time
We &apos;re not working with the way the bees are .
And we found in the Arab _UNK_ ,
And I &apos;m going to show you some of these pictures
Now I &apos;m going to conclude the content of my talk today
The most common secret _UNK_ we &apos;re climbing the spirit of spirit .
from the bottom , or at the bottom ,
A _UNK_ is a process of _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s about the _UNK_ struggle between good and evil .
And we all believe that we are in good terms .
Right , we &apos;re bees . We &apos;re _UNK_ out of the hive .
in a very low level , very comfortable and comfortable .
like our _UNK_ : to the entertainment center of my house .
is to find a _UNK_ to a higher level .
I was talking about my students in Virginia
They all want to find a _UNK_ or a call .
But first I want to tell you why I &apos;m here .
My office is about half the room in the bedroom ,
I realized that I had to give myself another place .
because there is no room in the house . So I can only consider my backyard .
It &apos;s important to have enough space , and I &apos;m going to be able to make my own decisions .
for people who build a space for themselves . &quot;
I found that there were _UNK_ in the early days .
It was unique because he lived with his wife and mother .
In the popular culture , _UNK_ had his own headquarters .
So I thought I had to go out and walk
Look at what people are building for themselves now .
This is the first space I found . In Tennessee _UNK_ .
From outside it looks like it &apos;s a very typical garage , very nice garage .
This , in my opinion , is a very classic space .
And I found that space is not just in the interior .
This man built a _UNK_ in his backyard ,
This is another outside space , a little bit more complex .
It &apos;s about 1,000 square feet of the interior space .
I realized that what I was looking for was not what I wanted to find ,
And I found a lot of beer _UNK_ ,
But some of them are for work , some are for entertainment ,
The most important thing is , I was surprised to find what I found .
From outside , this is a typical _UNK_ garage .
The only way to give you a hint of this _UNK_ window .
This is another kind of scene . This is a suburb of _UNK_ Vegas .
It has a good reason to build it .
and the people who build it is _UNK_ .
He &apos;s training in this room . He &apos;s trained other people .
At the right side of the garage , he had a medal room ,
And here he can do his own achievements ,
This is another important part of a artificial space .
It looks inside the interior of a British ship .
It _UNK_ a lot of 18 th century to _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So , when I ended up my trip ,
and left me with a deep impression that they all have a personality ,
I realized that it was because I met people
and they love their collection and their interests .
So if you don &apos;t have a space for yourself ,
I urge you to find one , and go in .
until about a few days ago it was
And that &apos;s what makes me feel more _UNK_
We have no choice -- we have a compromise .
You know , if you take a projector ,
from the back or the side , or the _UNK_ ,
So we &apos;re going to start with the first picture .
This is the first time I came to _UNK_
You get to a big airport , but only one B ,
And my day , I was -- I took a picture of it .
I thought , God , this is the most cool thing I &apos;ve ever seen in the airport
It &apos;s just a _UNK_ of the customs .
I was really interested in the design of _UNK_ ,
how they respond to this design in emotions .
This story , this painting -- whatever it is ,
I think this is a very clear example
This is a garage garage that was _UNK_ by the same thing .
This is the first door . You see what it means .
And I &apos;m going to look at the next door .
OK , do you want to stop in front of the _UNK_ ?
And the master gave the emotions in it --
But it wasn &apos;t written , it didn &apos;t need to be written .
I think I &apos;ll stop at the front of the other family .
And it &apos;s getting more and more simplicity
It becomes so simple that it &apos;s kind of beginning
And there &apos;s a trend that starts to express self .
But when I was Milan , I saw this _UNK_
It &apos;s just a little better brand , it &apos;s going to turn around .
He didn &apos;t want to lead it in the past ,
or they don &apos;t want to rent this brand again .
The _UNK_ was so lazy that he couldn &apos;t want to _UNK_ the brand .
I think it might be more likely to be
the original ad can lead to your attention .
I hope you will not buy the _UNK_ stuff --
The first one is called &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; The end of printing is already on the fifth page .
I just started talking about William _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
He said , &quot; No , he &apos;ll be the end of printing . &quot;
I just want you to influence the film and the book .
And at the end of the film , he said ,
I didn &apos;t get it , but I tried it , but he said ,
And he said , &quot; Of course , this is not the reality . &quot;
I think it &apos;s not the only element in design .
In fact , most of the schools have _UNK_ it
It &apos;s hard to teach people three steps of intuition .
But we can teach you the &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot;
And here &apos;s a quote from Einstein , he said ,
&quot; On the way to explore , intelligence can &apos;t help ,
The answer is automatically around you , you don &apos;t know where it comes from , and why don &apos;t you know why ? &quot;
It &apos;s a little bit like when someone says , who is written ?
the more you try to think about it
_UNK_ can give you the answer , in some sense ,
If you had any design , they would tell you that it wasn &apos;t going to read .
I think you &apos;re going to come out , more important , I think it &apos;s right .
And more importantly , it doesn &apos;t represent the right message .
I was with his wife and his son
and collected about 600 words of _UNK_ ,
And they were _UNK_ to the times .
that this book is called &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; which is another &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
It &apos;s -- many of them have never been published .
But I decided that I liked this page .
I love it -- so I left it .
It &apos;s not a little bit of a relationship with the book .
But I think it &apos;s a nice thing to do
&quot; New media is not connected to nature ; they are natural . &quot;
and to think of wisdom as a personal property .
&quot; When people are _UNK_ to create a new _UNK_ ,
They would always be clear of the world before . &quot;
&quot; There are no other environments in the electronics era ,
&quot; There are no other environments in the electronics era ,
&quot; There are no other environments in the electronics era ,
And I showed it because it was all about all of a sudden
in the back of my house in Los Angeles ,
Surely , some of the _UNK_ _UNK_ in the &apos; 60s ,
I asked people who sold the house , what we just stopped .
I asked people who sold the house , what we just stopped .
I finally went down and saw the old round of _UNK_
There are two bed , a strange , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
And it was amazing that it was made of a very cheap metal .
It &apos;s already eaten completely , it &apos;s water , water , and spiders .
And then I _UNK_ , how do they think about ?
But I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to use it for nine inches .
The _UNK_ has been used to use a strong rubber tape .
This is a experiment that gives a client a client ,
We took a group of six photos of photographs
and try to make it as a media media media
I took this photograph , and I cut it out .
If you want to look at the picture --
Think about the whole thing -- please go to the website ,
I guess a lot of surfing is going to the website .
I didn &apos;t survey data , so I might say it was wrong .
I didn &apos;t have them , but it was just a piece of work .
This is a organization in New York City , called _UNK_ .
You can &apos;t , that one , you &apos;ve never seen it --
But the next line is really a kind of _UNK_ .
It says , &quot; If a cigarette company can liar , we can . &quot; But --
These are all _UNK_ between the night and night .
It was _UNK_ to be done by _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a little bit , you know , _UNK_ things .
a _UNK_ for the Pacific Art Center , a school in Florida ,
This is a particularly amazing thing that I &apos;ve found recently
I was completely unexpected in this period , and this stage ,
but people also have this need -- _UNK_ their skin .
This is either the old product that changed the new packaging .
I went to the world to do _UNK_
to design a new sign for the toilet .
I think this is a more successful solution
and all the bars and restaurants in the evening .
I can &apos;t imagine a picture of the old couple to the bathroom --
I worked for Microsoft a few years ago
I was a social study ; I was not trained .
Sometimes people say , &quot; Well , you don &apos;t have a spectrum
because there &apos;s no product that I &apos;m going to push .
They just want to improve the brand image of Microsoft .
to make Microsoft look like some human nature .
And I added the ad and the _UNK_
Hey , there &apos;s still a normal person to work here .
Our umbrella was printed on the _UNK_ , &quot; Thank God . &quot;
to become a good one , not to avoid ,
I had to go back to the narrow , gray plastic _UNK_
But anyway , this is one of my most _UNK_ ads .
It looks like the girl looks at the computer
_UNK_ is , &quot; _UNK_ . &quot; And the software interface goes out
And that &apos;s what the ad plan was going to be released .
But the German department did a little change , and didn &apos;t tell me
and don &apos;t need to tell me , because things are _UNK_ .
This is the ad in the global world .
If you &apos;re going to put a _UNK_ in advertising , find a _UNK_ ,
I always felt that this _UNK_ had been there for a week , you know ,
He was waiting for the program to start _UNK_ , and you see it .
And the _UNK_ explained to me that this changes
&quot; Look , for example , we have no small green people in our country ;
Why are you going to put small green people into advertising ? &quot;
So I understood their logic . I was totally opposed .
to be able to accept a black girl sitting in front of a computer
And this magazine is going to read the article ,
to listen to music , and try to explain
There is no _UNK_ , no system , no advance _UNK_ .
is totally the personality of our music .
like rock star _UNK_ their _UNK_ teacher at school .
And Ray _UNK_ &apos;s good article in _UNK_
And I was lucky to find a picture of a teacher sitting in the book .
It &apos;s really boring to talk about Brian _UNK_ --
You can pick it up and turn it into _UNK_ or whatever normal _UNK_ .
But it &apos;s not good to write ; it &apos;s not worth doing that .
I &apos;m interested in how the big magazine works .
I &apos;d like to see how the _UNK_ and the News _UNK_
The choice is that we &apos;ve seen all these pictures
the kind of _UNK_ , the texture of it --
If &quot; _UNK_ &quot; -- there &apos;s no use here --
On the left we see people dying or _UNK_
And the right thing is to tell us a new way to stop _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not _UNK_ because the plane was taken off .
And the one on the right says , &quot; He always knows how to get me excited . &quot;
And unfortunately , it seems a little bit right , maybe it &apos;s a _UNK_ .
A lot of children became an orphan that day .
I think even if it &apos;s a blank page ,
This is probably not going to be a bad one :
Two women , in one direction , all wear jeans .
And the other thing is that _UNK_ and milk
And I did a lecture in New York City a few months later .
And then one came up and said to me --
They &apos;ve been email -- they said they love this talk ,
and found a note of the car that they thought
maybe New York City is going to come back in the shadow of _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a very _UNK_ time to find it in the car ,
It seems to be true that we are back again .
There &apos;s a guy who told me something called _UNK_ ,
These are the main points of my lecture -- maybe some of the things I &apos;m talking about .
I saw it in the airplane as a _UNK_ .
I &apos;m not sure whether it &apos;s a progressive or a good idea
because if you &apos;re in front of the computer ,
You can put a plate on a keyboard
It &apos;s like you don &apos;t have a day to take a job on the side .
Now there &apos;s a dish , and it &apos;s very convenient .
to make a piece of paper , play a few words , and then --
If you doubt the power of the plane design ,
This ordinary sign says , &quot; _UNK_ Hitler &apos;s vote . &quot; No other .
And even though it was a little _UNK_ ,
So what &apos;s going to happen next ? And what &apos;s going to happen
the importance of human beings is going to be obvious .
You have to do something in your personality .
No one can do that : no one can use your life background
your parents , the process of growth and life ,
If you do that , it &apos;s really the only way to create unique works
and you would love your work much more .
This -- I love the arts ; it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ .
And this is the combination of the two things
Maybe she &apos;s calling it &quot; _UNK_ or the sea _UNK_ . &quot;
She was willing to find a bull in 20 dollars .
I &apos;m going to search for more than 20 dollars .
I think it &apos;s like people calling up the _UNK_ .
A dog came up with you , and you said ,
Oh , it must be _UNK_ ; it must be a friendly one .
I &apos;m sure she never found a dog because I put a notice
I was invited to speak at a meeting in _UNK_ a few years ago .
The theme is courage , the people told me
What is the courage to do a flat designer ?
I remember seeing a picture of my father .
My dad was a pilot who told me
When you &apos;re _UNK_ to be a pilot ,
those people tell you that there are _UNK_ to 50
But you know , the government built a plane ;
And they said , &quot; Look at it , do they want to ? &quot;
I started thinking about some of the things I had to do
And most of these are not going to _UNK_ life .
Why don &apos;t you put your personality into the work ?
When I was taught , I always asked the students
And as a teacher , you hear the answer ,
I &apos;ve heard the best -- I believe some of you &apos;ve heard about --
If you can afford -- if it &apos;s not a problem ,
If you &apos;re going to , your job is great .
If you don &apos;t , what are you _UNK_ in a blind fight ?
It &apos;s a long time before you die ,
I don &apos;t know how you think , but I haven &apos;t done it yet .
I spent the last year thinking , how should it be ?
Am I going to _UNK_ it ? Am I going to _UNK_ it ?
Are I _UNK_ ? Like you , the latest thing is always _UNK_ to me .
But on the other hand , a few years ago ,
in the power of the world , the power of itself ,
_UNK_ 3,000 miles of America &apos;s path , only by itself ,
trying to get it to dominate my life .
And at the same time , I had a _UNK_ website ,
Every day , a new technology product is introduced .
And so I was really _UNK_ about what technology really meant .
And it &apos;s related to human beings , and it &apos;s related to nature ,
I don &apos;t even know how we really know technology .
There was an early definition of technology .
This is the first case of what I found ,
is the art and science at Cambridge University ,
It was obvious that the word &quot; technology &quot; didn &apos;t exist . But it was obvious .
I like Alan to a definition of technology .
He said , technology is anything you invented after birth .
but it covers a lot of what we &apos;re talking about .
Danny actually has a _UNK_ version of it --
He said , technology is not something that can be used .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking about now .
but I &apos;m interested in another definition of technology .
and it &apos;s going to reach more basic things .
more deep stuff . When I try to understand it ,
I suddenly found an idea of understanding the problem ,
It seems to be more accorded with the needs of my exploration .
I &apos;ll start to talk about it this morning .
So this is a _UNK_ attempt to do .
And the question that I got is that ,
What is the technology going to be ? It &apos;s not that
It &apos;s going to be chocolate or candy . I mean ,
What &apos;s going on in the whole river ? A way of thinking :
Think about biological tissue , we hear a lot of them .
And the skills of the _UNK_ are :
It &apos;s just a gene that is the carrier of genes .
So what does it mean ? _UNK_ genes are selfish .
If we look at the science of technology ,
to see our culture world , what is technology going to be ?
It &apos;s like looking at the organism as a genetic .
But it &apos;s still constructive . So I try to say ,
What if we take the science world , what is it going to be ?
We have to actually go back to life . Because it &apos;s obvious ,
If we go back to the origins of technology ,
I think it &apos;s going to go back to life .
So I &apos;m going to start with my little exploration ,
We don &apos;t really know the current life on the planet .
It &apos;s great for the _UNK_ of the marine DNA .
The work of Brian _UNK_ is also part of the attempts ,
One of the things that we should do is to draw the _UNK_ .
and looked at the intersection of the _UNK_ ,
Look at what life is there . If we use
Mars is _UNK_ , we haven &apos;t been on the planet ,
It &apos;s not another planet , it &apos;s not a _UNK_ .
This is a ant , and it _UNK_ the companion in the stomach .
every one of these organisms -- you talk about people ,
I don &apos;t want to know which kind of biology principle
is that there is no exceptions to any organism .
We want to get anything that we want to --
And if you &apos;ve heard about _UNK_ habits ,
You know , nothing we &apos;re talking about is suitable for all life .
because every part of it is _UNK_ it .
This is the solar sea . It &apos;s a _UNK_ .
It combined with _UNK_ in the body as much energy .
This is another one . This is the _UNK_ .
And that was at the bottom , blue , a _UNK_ ,
The _UNK_ of the _UNK_ will provide energy in the body .
These are all _UNK_ , if we look at life orientation ,
the general form , the consensus of the present ,
that plants , animals and fungi and _UNK_ ,
This is the ordinary orientation of life , a way of looking at life today .
is to look at it in the evolution of evolution .
Here we have a _UNK_ , it &apos;s not a linear time ,
We &apos;re going to get it out of the center .
At the center is the primitive , this is the _UNK_ of all life .
and all the six different worlds have to be seen .
_UNK_ _UNK_ species , you see where we are .
And I love this , because it shows
_UNK_ organisms on the planet are the same evolution .
that fungi and bacteria are all evolving in the world .
And they &apos;re going to be the same thing ,
and through the same test to develop what it looks like today .
But we see that every of these is actually _UNK_ ,
and all kinds of ways to survive .
If we look at the long-term trends of life , if we start saying ,
What &apos;s going to evolve ? We see if we see the administrator .
One of the things that evolved is that
There is no life on the planet to find .
We find life in every single long term ,
There are bacteria in the core of the _UNK_ - rocks .
Life _UNK_ , it never _UNK_ . It _UNK_ and goes up .
more and more _UNK_ material on the planet
Another thing we see is diversity . We see _UNK_ .
And we can see that they become complicated .
In fact , the data we have now showed
It &apos;s actually getting more complicated in the long term .
And I &apos;m going to talk about it again .
One of the things we see in life is that it &apos;s _UNK_
that are growing out of the _UNK_ . And that &apos;s what happens .
More and more life , the entire environment is in other life .
They never reach the inside . There are more common evolution .
complex , and community . I take this idea , say ,
And again , what is the technology going to be ?
The hammer is getting more and more and more _UNK_ .
And this is all the things in Japan .
I want my daughter -- send her a counter ,
I &apos;m going to look around her last summer
How many of the species we have in our house .
And it turns out that there are _UNK_ types .
I &apos;ve done it , and I found the king of England
It was all the wealth of England at the time .
So we see a lot of the stuff diversity .
This is the _UNK_ of the World War , three _UNK_ .
Well , this is what we &apos;re going to do : the world machine
New technology is just developed by other technologies .
Most of the machines are going to deal with other technologies .
Third , the idea of machine life , the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s _UNK_ . And I &apos;m happy to say ,
The machine is _UNK_ , and it &apos;s pretty obvious .
like biological evolution . We see the same trends .
It &apos;s complicated . It might be not surprising .
Because if we look at the evolution of _UNK_ ,
You can actually follow the branches of evolution
I think , in fact , technology is the seventh largest world of life .
And it &apos;s going to work and functions like that .
We can think of it as the seventh World .
And so it looks like it &apos;s over the top ,
the animal kingdom . If you do that ,
We &apos;re going to discover -- we can actually face technology .
This is _UNK_ , and he put forward with _UNK_
But amateur , he also _UNK_ small copper speakers .
He has the biggest collector in the world -- about 500 .
He decided to think of them as a _UNK_ or a snail ,
and try to develop the _UNK_ of their time .
It &apos;s a chart he got , and it &apos;s not quite open .
And if you look at the red line ,
It basically means that a generation of _UNK_
Now no one has made it . It &apos;s not that .
After the extinction , you can &apos;t get it to a generation .
but it &apos;s going to happen in the technology .
It &apos;s very unique , you can see this _UNK_ ,
This is the technology system and the _UNK_ system .
In fact , the notion of _UNK_ is very important ,
So , I started thinking about the old technology .
So , in fact , technology is not going to die .
And I talked to a scientific _UNK_ , and he said ,
? Well , that steam car is still _UNK_ ?
They are not only , but you can buy a new part of the steam car .
And this website has a new set of parts
to supply the car . I loved it .
You can buy steam valve . I mean , someone was selling .
So , I started thinking , maybe this is just an exception .
Maybe I should look at it in a more conservative way .
I took my _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , I took a page -- not completely chosen --
And what I chose is actually not that hard .
because a lot of the things in the pages
and it &apos;s made . But I choose this page .
I said , how many of these things are still making ?
but not _UNK_ . I want to know how many of these things are still making .
They &apos;re making it . So you can buy _UNK_ .
is the _UNK_ -- you get _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
All these things are not _UNK_ . These are --
You can order it . You can go online , you can buy it ,
new manufacturing . So , some point of view , technology _UNK_ .
In fact , you can buy 50 dollars a Stone Age knife
in the same way a thousand years ago .
It has a short _UNK_ , 50 dollars . And in fact ,
The important thing is that this technology never fails to die .
It &apos;s not just _UNK_ . It &apos;s always alive .
And in the new _UNK_ , he was _UNK_ .
until 20 years ago , it seemed like it was a practical thing .
Even when we tried to give up a technology , it was hard to get it .
We all heard the car to give up .
We &apos;ve heard this , and that . But I &apos;m going to go back
in the history of the last year ,
And then I tried to figure out when they came back ,
because they &apos;re always looking back . And it &apos;s time :
that are _UNK_ and limits the length of time .
as the history develops . That &apos;s basically what you can delay technology ,
and can &apos;t abandon it . It &apos;s meaning . It &apos;s a certain sense ,
The purpose is to _UNK_ the idea of _UNK_ .
When we take it , we take the idea of culture
and _UNK_ it into the evolution of life .
We found that every single time -- every single single shift in life --
and they actually changed the way it had .
So , the evolutionary steps are basically in
to create new ideas and new ways of _UNK_ .
How do you go and explore the way it &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s _UNK_ the way we &apos;re looking for ideas .
So , evolution is the way to change the competition rules .
And what technology really does is create a better way of evolution .
is the definition of infinite _UNK_ . _UNK_ is going to win ,
The unlimited _UNK_ is to be a race to stop .
I believe that technology is actually a _UNK_ .
is actually in the beginning of the Big Bang ?
in the universe is _UNK_ by a billion planets .
The entire universe is _UNK_ for a small _UNK_ ,
It was so tight that it could not have any difference .
There is no difference . And in the Big Bang ,
So , when it _UNK_ , when things spread out ,
And those are the things that technology has given us .
Technology brings us to us : choice , possible , free .
It &apos;s the fundamental part of the technology that &apos;s going to happen .
So , when we hold the _UNK_ , we hold it up .
And so we kept on the technology --
because we &apos;re going to do this . These things are good .
Every time we make a new opportunity ,
I think it &apos;s really important . Because if you can imagine
before the _UNK_ _UNK_ invented the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
There are hundreds of millions of children today
Their self - expression has not been invented yet .
to make everyone on the planet have the potential
We need hundreds of people like this .
I &apos;m going to skip over some of the opposition .
because I don &apos;t know why there &apos;s a forest _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t know why , at least it seems to be some
How do this impact our dignity , I just propose
And the seven World , because it &apos;s very close to life ,
Maybe we can take it back , to help us monitor life .
What we &apos;re trying to do is to find a good home for technology .
It &apos;s a horrible thing to spray the cotton tube ,
_UNK_ the _UNK_ of the small village malaria leads to millions of deaths .
All of us think that we prefer the humanitarian _UNK_
are all _UNK_ by technology . This is the _UNK_ .
Look , technology is the way to _UNK_ evolution .
It &apos;s a way to explore possible and opportunity and create more .
It &apos;s actually a way to participate in _UNK_ and play all kinds of _UNK_ .
So , when I think about what technology is going to be ,
I think it &apos;s about everyone here , and I believe ,
Everybody here has a mission . Your task is
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
If you play _UNK_ , you will have somebody else ,
_UNK_ will be extended and sustainable even if you have left .
That &apos;s the _UNK_ . Technology is the technology .
We are involved in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
So I think we should _UNK_ the technology
because it &apos;s the journey that we find ourselves .
The first time I was a _UNK_ in my childhood .
The county is located in the _UNK_ of five rivers ,
This is absolutely a _UNK_ of magic .
If you &apos;re a kid who likes wild animals .
The _UNK_ flow into the Gulf and eventually _UNK_ the Gulf .
I remember when I first met the _UNK_ ,
I was swimming in the Gulf and saw a little _UNK_ .
And I caught it at the bottom of the sea ,
I was _UNK_ by its speed and strength and _UNK_ .
It _UNK_ at my fingertips and climbed on my back hand .
I was totally _UNK_ by this wonderful creature .
And then it _UNK_ a little bit in my palm .
When I look at it , it _UNK_ the _UNK_ down to the body ,
I thought , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; I &apos;ve never seen such a funny thing !
And after all , I decided that it was time
This _UNK_ left my palm and made an amazing thing .
This _UNK_ left my palm and made an amazing thing .
And I went to college , and I got a degree of biology ,
to go to Hawaii and go to the graduate degree ,
As a student , I was sent to the aquarium in Hawaii at the same time .
There &apos;s a lot of big fish in this aquarium ,
I should go out and collect these fantastic creatures
and take them here , through these wonderful fish ,
And although the fish in the pond look beautiful ,
the _UNK_ would come up and look at you .
You know , &quot; Is it really looking at me ? It really looks at me ! &quot;
When you go to the fish , you &apos;ll see
Other people will _UNK_ the _UNK_ and hide in the rock .
When I came to the _UNK_ , he was watching me .
The _UNK_ &apos;s eye structure is very special ,
So when I appeared in front of the fish ,
It seems that I &apos;m only three to four inches away .
This _UNK_ was standing on a small rock ,
It _UNK_ the rock and _UNK_ the glass of the fish .
So I was able to look at this animal at six inches close to seven inches ,
And I was so close to it ,
Until today , when I looked at my hand , I could remember the scene .
It _UNK_ a piece of rock at the end of the pool .
and put them in the _UNK_ of the fish ,
_UNK_ was crushed and bumped into the front of the glass and dropped , and _UNK_ the voice of the paper .
And then it _UNK_ up , _UNK_ the other _UNK_ , _UNK_ them .
And then it raised a _UNK_ , so I raised a arm .
Then it raised another one , and I raised another arm .
I suddenly realized that in this game I was never a _UNK_ ,
because I had two arms , and it had six left .
But what I want to tell you is that
This is a rather complex behavior for no _UNK_ animals .
And one of the interesting things that happened ,
The aquarium came up with a guest .
He asked me to go to _UNK_ with some of my friends ,
When we are ready to leave , he handed us two _UNK_ cameras .
Well , some biologists are going to make a film --
And then we did this , and we took a film ,
although it may be a film on the _UNK_ .
But to me , I think it &apos;s interesting to me .
I remember the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
I never told anybody that I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
And of course , what I learned in school really did me benefit .
You need to go to the wild animals ,
and some of them live in a long way .
You need to spend a lot of time
If it comes to the name of it ,
because I could definitely have three trees on the island
It was a very _UNK_ time in the middle of the day ,
So our first task is to find them ,
And our idea is that we &apos;ve just been here for a month ,
I want to make these animals adapt to our existence .
so we can see their behavior without _UNK_ them .
every little day , a little bit , a little bit ,
so you can see where they feel tense ,
And then you go back , and you get back for hours ,
They may think , &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing , but they don &apos;t hurt me . &quot;
I don &apos;t know if they see a _UNK_ crab , or maybe one of them ,
But anyway , they &apos;re going to come up .
And the water went down and stopped on the reef ,
As soon as the crab meets these _UNK_ , it will die .
I &apos;ve always wanted to know what &apos;s happening in that network .
This is the first time I saw them eating the famous _UNK_ .
If you want to make a series of different animals ,
You may need to first choose a rather common animal .
The _UNK_ is a kind of distribution area ,
If you want to get rid of all the things
Some of the things you &apos;ve never known before , that &apos;s going to dive .
You put on diving suits , put yourself up , open a little bit of oxygen ,
It can clear out your _UNK_ carbon dioxide for you .
_UNK_ , that &apos;s a world that &apos;s not related to the ground .
And as you get deep in the middle ,
After thousands of feet , it has become a _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to be able to explain
And most of the things that live here
But what we know is that it &apos;s not just that far ,
where I think it &apos;s more special to be there .
Some of them are even about thousands of feet
When you dive into that valley , you &apos;re going to come to a very exciting place .
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ will be filled with these cracks .
The top of them is three to three deep feet ,
the water causes the _UNK_ to the center of the Earth ,
and started _UNK_ and _UNK_ the ground ,
It &apos;s like a fountain fountain in the _UNK_ park .
It &apos;s like the whole _UNK_ National Park .
It &apos;s about 600 to 700 _UNK_ temperature out of the water .
And the temperature around the water is only a few degrees .
You &apos;ve been aware of all the black _UNK_ around the sea .
And on the top of these _UNK_ worms
_UNK_ between boiling water and cold water and water .
all the core of life on the planet ,
You would feel like to be on the other planet .
But it &apos;s in the earth , and it &apos;s really amazing .
But if you &apos;re eight years back to this _UNK_ ,
and have formed a whole new _UNK_ community .
And this kind of life cycle of life
And when you go out and shoot a great Gulf ,
And you think , &quot; Well , I see them .
This is a beautiful _UNK_ with lots of _UNK_ and _UNK_ . &quot;
No coral , no algae , sea water becomes _UNK_ .
And there was a hill behind the back , and it was residential ,
The new road is coming back and forth .
from a golf course into the Gulf .
_UNK_ killed all the _UNK_ and small animals ,
I &apos;ve been to a Gulf that has been damaged .
to work on the other side of the island .
It was the beach that she became a great , very beautiful .
all around the world are living reefs and _UNK_ ,
and clear water , you can &apos;t ask , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
They realized everything happened on the _UNK_ and stopped ,
She said that a small part of the thought
One of the problems that people first put forward
And these problems are such a global , and it looks impossible . &quot;
What you really care about is not just limited to where you live .
And maybe it &apos;s going to be able to cycle
In fact , the world &apos;s communications technology is so developed ,
in Alaska , you know what happened in China ,
what _UNK_ is doing and what people are going to do in Britain --
and maybe _UNK_ , and make a career .
stand on your own stand and think , in other words , look at yourself .
So they have no option , but we can do it .
as people who get _UNK_ new homes in the Gulf .
is that we can do what we can do ,
And I want these things to be like , &quot;
If you have a pile of _UNK_ and toxic waste ,
and really care about our deep ocean .
back to _UNK_ and _UNK_ , in my age ,
The little girl should be a kind of kindness ,
Is it really clear that what should we look like ?
There &apos;s a lot of women around us ,
As our mother , our aunt , our sister ,
But I didn &apos;t go out and do what women should do .
Instead , she knew what I needed , she _UNK_ me .
since I knew that my cartoon could be accepted ,
I can draw and do what I want to do ,
And I &apos;m not going to do something that I &apos;m not good at ,
We always _UNK_ -- we know about girls ,
What is the most important color in the world ?
What are we taught to what we should look like ?
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen after a long time ,
It makes us a very vulnerable position .
What better way to change these rules than humor ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
a cartoon of our behavior rules and our _UNK_ ,
So what if you mix women and cartoon together ?
and we can make the sound of the same .
I grew up from Washington , where I grew up ,
And I tried to paint this to bring our family together ,
trying to create a cartoon of the family together .
My parents were divorced and my sister was arrested .
I found that I didn &apos;t wear _UNK_ shoes ,
And when I was 20 years old , I was
I found that few women were engaged in cartoon industry .
And I thought , when I was 40 years old , I started thinking ,
So why do I not create a cartoon of political subjects
to think about these silly rules that we follow .
But I think the rules that I talk about
Every culture has its own behavior rules ,
Every woman has to face the same rule .
Women , because we are in the base , we know traditions ,
Not only that , cartoon can make it feel _UNK_ ,
Not only in intelligence , it is more _UNK_ in the mind .
These women are working hard in some very difficult situations ,
I can work with them , and I feel very lucky .
and it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ in the last 200 years .
to the _UNK_ of the 20th century ,
And we feel that sustainability is going to happen .
The global _UNK_ has been more than _UNK_ years ago .
And this is because the city is _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
And these people are doing these jobs ,
And here &apos;s a question that we want to do .
to _UNK_ , one billion people on the planet
in Edinburgh and New York City and New York
It seems that they might look like the future .
We need a rigorous scientific theory of the city .
The two questions have been spinning around my head .
a company &apos;s DNA , a city of metabolism , etc .
Why is the city always _UNK_ up ?
You can drop a bomb bomb bomb into a city
If you have a _UNK_ principle , you should predict
If you ask a question of common sense ,
how many branch of a big tree you know .
The question is whether it &apos;s suitable for the city ,
It can grow up to 100 million units
And we &apos;re going to talk about this a little bit later .
This is a mouse that can be you .
And this shows that the growth of mice
And it turns out that its powerful _UNK_
the percentage of the income and the company
for the energy you need to eat every day .
It &apos;s a very interesting structure that it &apos;s going to go about 10 times .
And even though it was in the universe ,
is less than one of these _UNK_ .
And when the body is a double _UNK_ ,
And it _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the economy .
And as long as you go through this _UNK_ ,
And if you say a _UNK_ body ,
I can tell you about its physical and life cycle ,
And the reason is that the Internet is ,
This is a little creature in the elephant .
And one of the things I &apos;m talking about is that
in the way that we can do it ,
You tell me that the scale of the city
The bigger the city gas station is not the _UNK_ .
But if you look at Japan or Columbia ,
whether the path or the wires are going to be ,
is the same size as the size of the economy .
It &apos;s not going to be changed any time .
The _UNK_ is used as a scale parameter .
more than one in the _UNK_ and the _UNK_
the more it is than the _UNK_ of biology .
The higher the wages there are more intelligent people .
And you can see that there &apos;s a lot of
If the scale of a city comes from 100,000 to 200,000
from a million to 20 million to 20 million
The reason for the city &apos;s new population every week
They think that the good things are going to be
And I don &apos;t have time to explain the math
whatever the corner you have on the planet
But all of the data shows are the same .
The city is a collection of our activities and these activities .
And those networks and their mathematical structures
is going to increase the size of the scale
And on the left is the heart rate
And over and over again , this is the case of biology .
One of the amazing principles of _UNK_ is that
In fact , if you compare it to the data ,
And the reason that it &apos;s going to collapse
how much of the resources that are _UNK_
How do we avoid this ? We &apos;ve tried to do it .
and it &apos;s going to be closer to the point
We &apos;re not only sitting in a _UNK_ machine
We have to accelerate the update of the machine .
The problem is that there is a social economy
And I &apos;m going to spend a minute
And the one on the right is _UNK_ .
than the number of employees in the company
and look at how the companies are doing
What I &apos;m showing you today is just a tip of an iceberg .
So if you tell me that there &apos;s a scale
I can predict the current situation of _UNK_
I &apos;ve got a lot of knowledge about children and children .
in the book , in the head of the teacher ,
And she needed to go to school to get these knowledge ,
And again , he had to go to school
and then store these knowledge in his only moving memory , which is his head ,
from teacher to students , and then use it in the world .
We have a set of encyclopedia in our house .
because I don &apos;t need to wait for the library to get these knowledge ,
This changed the way I interact with information .
And I was reading from high school
is that the network is starting to start
That &apos;s my first year in teaching , full of enthusiasm , ready to teach American governments . &quot;
At first , I learned something to change my teaching policy .
I would give them a chance to actually experience
I didn &apos;t tell them what to do , or how to do it .
to build a campaign for their own communities .
to give them a better understanding of these candidates .
And there &apos;s a _UNK_ street that &apos;s not perfect ,
&quot; Oh , look at her , _UNK_ , try to do that . &quot;
But I know that kids will be here
I said to them every week how I expected them .
That was their night , that was experience , that was a real experience .
I &apos;ve been reading books in the town for a few years ,
Fortunately , I didn &apos;t have to teach American politics .
This time , it was a more exciting geography .
And I came up with this little _UNK_
where , sometimes , we get some opportunity .
And he was going to go to the next high school ,
We can walk to that school , and we don &apos;t even have a bus .
How do you talk about race _UNK_ and _UNK_ ?
So we decided to see how Paul _UNK_ did .
A ordinary man how to use his life to do positive examples .
in their life , in their own story , or in their own world ,
to find people who think they &apos;ve done something like this .
I want them to make a short film for these people and _UNK_ .
No one really knows how to make a video .
But they &apos;re very _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to use their own sound .
And when you want kids to use their voice ,
And after you ask them to listen to those _UNK_
It was the _UNK_ College of _UNK_
a way that I understand how kids can work ,
to give my grandmother and my father to school .
Even the time I read myself , because of the scarce information ,
to a time that we are in the surplus of information .
So how do you deal with the knowledge around the world ?
What if they don &apos;t need to go to school again ?
So these kids take their laptops every day ,
One thing that you need to be adapted
And you have to adapt to a idea
a culture that is good for choosing the problem ,
to ask them to always have the right answer .
This is a piece of work in this project .
because we have the idea of error and failure .
And the result is that we decided to report the report as our school .
And I asked them to take the money
and look at what the head is interesting ,
because we never had that work , and they didn &apos;t know how to do it .
But when you &apos;re asked to express ideas in a different way ,
but I gave them the space to do the homework .
that the best visual work , and it didn &apos;t let anybody go down .
It took about two or three days to go .
And this is a student from a very _UNK_ .
And when I asked all the students , I asked them , &quot; Who had the best work ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s great . He &apos;s got some color together , &quot;
And they came up with the idea that we talked about
And then they said , &quot; Oh , it looks like it &apos;s not good . &quot;
That work has no good vision design , but it &apos;s very good information --
And we spent about an hour talking about this learning process ,
because it &apos;s not about which works are better ,
or I can make things like this ;
This year , when we try to work like this again ,
I have to be careful -- well , this is my favorite one --
in a environment that we abandoned traditional ideas
The students had to come to school to get the idea of knowledge ,
Instead , ask them , what can they do with these knowledge ?
When I asked the students to vote for the vote .
This is Robbie , this is the first vote ,
And he wanted to share with you the vote .
because we &apos;re going to go out of the real world .
And if we continue to take the education
are not going to happen , if we continue to education ,
because we can &apos;t rely on _UNK_ tests ,
A culture that has only a standard answer is no lead to our goal .
And when we walk into the _UNK_ ,
Some terms are the ones we don &apos;t want to hear .
but we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
And what I &apos;m going to talk about today
A new way to treat the thinking of disease .
Why don &apos;t we get _UNK_ if it doesn &apos;t work ?
What can we do in the clinical world and what we might do in the future ,
I promise , in 18 minutes , I must finish these .
because this graph tells you how the scientific magazine looked at it .
There was a lot of different articles about _UNK_ .
It &apos;s simply saying that the speed of _UNK_ your body
We can see how we know it in many ways .
We know that if the hip is injured , we can install a artificial _UNK_ .
This is the idea of the scientific cover of Science .
When they wrote a story about regeneration medicine before they did it .
And our ideas are , not to try to improve the symptoms .
I &apos;m going to talk about the subject again --
We don &apos;t do that , we can change a way to rebuild the body ,
through the regeneration of the injured organs and tissues .
Your body is exactly the same as you are ill .
Very few ideas -- if you agree to this is a good idea --
He was more famous in the flight of the airplane --
And he was with the Nobel Prize for _UNK_
and start thinking about this : can we grow organs ?
How do we develop a complete organ from the _UNK_ reactor ?
I &apos;m going to share some of the things that are going on right now .
But what I &apos;d like to do before I did this ,
to share with you a little bit about the health care system ,
_UNK_ actually increased the length of life in the world .
One of the challenges is that the more we live longer .
The longer we live , the bigger the costs are ,
It takes more money to deal with all our old diseases .
and it &apos;s more relevant to the population of 65 .
And you basically see , the more rich country
Why is this a particularly urgent test today ?
If the average population is 30 years old ,
that the general disease that needs to be treated
It may be only a _UNK_ in the ankle .
If the average population is 45 to 55 years old ,
Look at the population of the United States .
41 people who don &apos;t have any serious disease ,
to pay care for a medical care care for the lack of labor workers .
In 2010 , every _UNK_ is only about two labor population .
Every country in the world is so rich in the world .
when the aging of the population looked like this ?
You can see , it &apos;s about 45 years old , 40 to 45 years old ,
The cost of medicine will suddenly be _UNK_ .
And it &apos;s really interesting -- if you do appropriate statistics ,
You can see how many people spend on your medical care
and you &apos;ll see a peak about seven years before you die .
There are some things that we can really do ,
These things will change the treatment of such diseases ,
And these four things are not different from the insurance system and the legal system .
But they can &apos;t change the cost of health care at all .
One is not to treat it . You can _UNK_ the health resources .
We don &apos;t have to talk about it . It &apos;s too depressing .
And obviously a lot of money should be put into prevention .
But perhaps more interested in people , at least , more important
to be able to diagnose it before the disease is _UNK_ ,
and you take the disease out of it ,
For example , for example , it &apos;s an example of diabetes .
We will ultimately confirm the disease , but only when its symptoms are clearly marked .
In the next 40 years , we treat it as a symptom that _UNK_ it .
And the effect goes on . The insulin is a good treatment .
diabetes will cause the disease caused by complications is _UNK_ .
Why don &apos;t we get a little bit of a injection in the _UNK_
In the early days of diabetes , _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
Maybe this needle will be expensive when it &apos;s injection .
But if it works , we really can solve problems in a new way .
This video , I think , can be able to understand what I say .
Why don &apos;t we do that if you can do that ?
is to make every organ system that can do this .
And today &apos;s reality is that if we &apos;re sick ,
but you need to adapt to a new way of life .
from the soldiers in Iraq who lost their limb .
Think about it , if they don &apos;t need to deal with that ,
And then I &apos;ll show you what we &apos;ve done for this idea .
And the way we do it is to start talking to the body .
We need to talk about the language we have in our body ,
and _UNK_ the capacity to regenerate when we were a fetus .
A mammals , if the first three months of pregnancy loses a limb ,
So , our DNA has this kind of _UNK_ mechanism .
A child , before about six months ago ,
When they were five years old , they lost their ability .
So , if you talk to the body ,
So let &apos;s just use some of the technologies that are currently using
I &apos;m going to talk about three kinds of technologies
and then put them in the body , and they might start repair .
Yesterday &apos;s speech told us the importance of our new materials .
Maybe you can use these materials to repair the body &apos;s repair function .
In the end , we may use some _UNK_ devices
_UNK_ the body and give him the opportunity to heal himself .
I &apos;m going to show you an example of every technology ,
Steve Jobs of the University of _UNK_ University
And the idea is that the pig &apos;s small intestine ,
And if you can do that with the premise of _UNK_ ,
And this may include all the necessary factors and signals
If I could take this material , this is a natural material .
If I put it in other parts of the body ,
Or do I try to grow a new ear , but it &apos;s going to grow a small intestine ?
If this story doesn &apos;t give me a _UNK_ , I won &apos;t tell it .
But for those who are sensitive to people --
Even if you don &apos;t want to admit in front of friends --
_UNK_ . This is a great opportunity to show you your feet ,
_UNK_ cell phones , what is good , do not look at the screen .
What I &apos;m going to show you is a _UNK_ ulcer .
although -- it &apos;s better to see this before laugh .
I think a lot of times when we hear diabetes , diabetes ulcer ,
We can &apos;t relate to the final treatment of the ulcer ,
I &apos;m going to show this picture now . It &apos;s not going to be a long time .
This is a woman . She &apos;s got liver cancer at the same time ,
And she decided to keep her body integrity when she died .
So this woman decided to cure the ulcer for a year ,
to try to invent this new treatment for Steve .
This is what the wound looks like after 11 weeks .
And the material led the body to _UNK_ its repair program .
I &apos;m going to show you a few terrible pictures --
For those sensitive people , I &apos;ll tell you when you can look at the screen .
It was a horse . The horse had no pain .
If the horse is suffering , I will not show you the picture .
This is a gel made of this material ,
_UNK_ the whole _UNK_ and repeat the treatment for several times --
If you look at this wound _UNK_ , it will look good .
with this new material to heal their wound .
_UNK_ , the Defense Department , has just _UNK_ _UNK_ funding for Steve , who led a group of eight units
I &apos;m going to show you this value of $ _UNK_ .
This is a 78 - year - old man . He lost his fingertips .
Remember I could _UNK_ my lips before I heard that I had lost my fingers .
Now there &apos;s this material . There &apos;s a heart repair _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s got some cells at the same time ,
Here you can see a little _UNK_ in a _UNK_ dish .
This is the work of _UNK_ _UNK_ in Tokyo .
He could develop a _UNK_ tissue in the _UNK_ dish .
Then he can remove the tissue directly from the _UNK_ dish .
is to collect stem cells from a patient .
Like before , if you compare sensitive , don &apos;t look at it .
This is the same thing as Al Gore did ,
In different ways , after the heart is finished ,
we &apos;re going to see the stem cells of the patient ,
And when the operation started collecting the _UNK_ ,
will be directly injected into the heart of the patient .
And I &apos;m standing here , because of the later ,
I &apos;m going to point out that this technology is still at an early stage .
Now the stem cell is in , direct being injected into a beating heart .
We need all kinds of new technologies and devices ,
trying to get cells to the right part of the time .
There &apos;s a little bit of data here , just a little bit of data .
The number of samples were 20 , now accumulated to 100 .
His symptoms will be a little better than the _UNK_ .
If they were in the middle of the _UNK_ ,
The cool thing is that if you can _UNK_ early diagnosis of disease ,
and prevent the possibility of the disease _UNK_ .
It &apos;s just like this , but it &apos;s a low _UNK_ approach ,
Just three holes around the heart are _UNK_ around the heart .
and then _UNK_ the stem cells in the _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t have time to talk about it ,
to get to the point of almost _UNK_ ,
This is another example of the _UNK_ treatment in the clinical trial ,
This is the work of _UNK_ University in _UNK_ ,
She worked with a lot of scientists around the world .
In the United States , we have a lot of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So you can go to a clinic and you get a flat _UNK_ you want .
In this case , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ is isolated .
I think in the future we can see patients accept this treatment .
and the relationship between the people who work .
They need to be treated with _UNK_ from Iraq .
But if we knew what was going on for the burn ,
We know about it that the burn is now unable to cure .
and put it into the place that was burnt ,
and tried to make them go together long .
In this case , we designed a new _UNK_ reactor on the human body --
At the end of the year , the American Army should get it into clinical trial --
This creature reactor can be located on the _UNK_ .
and also transport some of the other things ,
Let me end up with some good news ,
The good news is that these research are now doing .
Almost every scientific engineering and clinical medicine is involved ,
Almost every scientific engineering and clinical medicine is involved ,
a lot of government , and a lot of places ,
have been aware that this is a new way of treating disease .
In the average age of population , Japan is the most old country in the world .
So they need to get the research successfully , or their medical system will be _UNK_ .
So they &apos;ve done a lot of investment in the field .
The first year &apos;s research budget has _UNK_ million dollars .
In the United States , we did a different way . We --
-- oh , if you can Al Gore come to the President of the real world .
This practice is basically a project paper _UNK_ some financial aid ,
to collect the resources and conditions that are necessary and focused on them .
I &apos;m going to end my speech , and maybe it &apos;s a little bit _UNK_ ,
is about the director of the NIH , a glamorous person .
and he visited the _UNK_ of some other health research
We tried to persuade us to give us a little bit ,
He could _UNK_ a small part of the budget next year
and _UNK_ it , to make sure that we can accelerate the pace
And at the end of this talk , you know ,
As _UNK_ , I think no one can change our ideal ,
I &apos;m going to tell you that when I get invited to the conference ,
These are the names that sound so simple .
They &apos;re not simply _UNK_ scientists who can influence the world .
And what I &apos;m going to do is make me look different .
So I thought a very _UNK_ English accent
But I don &apos;t think I should go there to my own .
So I think I should come here and show you my real voice .
Although many of you know I really mean a _UNK_ English _UNK_
But the theme of this section is to create
I know that I don &apos;t have any patents
So you can only see some of the things I &apos;ve done today
I love to find another one or more new self .
We all have the characteristics of the body .
How much do we try to _UNK_ self and discovery ?
How do we define our identity as a variable ?
So , for example , a person can turn into any other person ?
So I &apos;m going to show you all of the characters
so I can talk about these problems in a very easy way .
I brought them a few together today
They &apos;re going to have a little TED talk .
So you can think of it as a college in Sarah ,
So thank you for coming here today to me .
Well , thank you very much for my name .
So I came here today because a young girl called Sarah Jones .
And she &apos;s actually a _UNK_ , if you look carefully ,
She told me to go to her show .
_UNK_ is the work we &apos;re going to do , but we &apos;re all in her .
There are so many experts that come here
This is not the leaders of scientists and _UNK_
I saw _UNK_ _UNK_ I particularly liked her .
She just took _UNK_ in Google coffee shops ,
Oh , _UNK_ , I love her too much , she &apos;s really wonderful .
And when I met her , I felt so good .
So , I should talk about how _UNK_ I feel ,
And the world that we live is so important
It &apos;s almost impossible to imagine when I was a _UNK_ .
And you &apos;ve done all of these progress and development
And I love the diversity of this here .
When you stand here , you can see all kinds of people
I &apos;m always going to respond to what word can be used .
What can I say is that I can &apos;t say
I don &apos;t want to be rude to anybody .
I just think it &apos;s going to work with you .
And some of you are architects to build our better future .
And even though some of you are doing this very awful thing ,
And the problem that the world &apos;s market _UNK_
And of course , we all know that this is because all of these
I don &apos;t know what to do with other ways , so I &apos;ll say it in my own way .
is because of the _UNK_ business in _UNK_
You know these _UNK_ are government banks and Wall Street .
And the key is that I &apos;m really happy to see you come up with a practical way
So I &apos;m going to give you a honor to you .
And I want to _UNK_ you as a TED master .
to get to the point where it &apos;s too _UNK_ .
I &apos;m really glad to come to TED .
In fact , I grew up in the capital of the _UNK_ Republic
or the _UNK_ of Washington in New York City
I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s any other _UNK_ here .
But I know that _UNK_ came here yesterday .
And I &apos;m really sure that this is enough
I just want to be so nervous about it .
And I &apos;m not used to talk to you about
And whenever I &apos;m nervous , I &apos;m going to talk very quickly .
No one can understand what I &apos;m talking about .
I usually want to make my own _UNK_ .
But worse , Sarah Jones told me that we were only 18 minutes .
So I thought maybe I should be nervous .
I don &apos;t want to be confused , so I have to breathe deep .
So I want to say that I really love TED .
I can &apos;t do that . I can &apos;t get this tension .
And people don &apos;t believe that I &apos;m from here .
And I love the name of TED .
I know this is a real name . I just want to say ,
It was a _UNK_ word that was really cool .
And it sounds like a lot of people
In fact , I have a relationship with _UNK_ .
I &apos;m now the second grade student in college
I set up a group of friends in school
like you would like to enjoy this idea .
Our _UNK_ organization is much bigger than what you create .
And the _UNK_ is also a _UNK_ word .
I know this name is a little longer .
The director of the school does not let us use this _UNK_ .
Let &apos;s use full name to avoid _UNK_ .
I mean , _UNK_ American Society for _UNK_ and _UNK_
We tried to fight for students in school .
And these students are also my mother at the same time .
I &apos;m a mom , but I &apos;m going to work at the same time .
It &apos;s important to know how to find a model
I know that the way we live is not the same .
even though I had just gotten a promotion ,
because I was the leading _UNK_ of business ,
and the chief manager of the director
But I think it &apos;s not my own company . It &apos;s not just like we &apos;ve just started .
to help people who want to continue learning to _UNK_ their minds .
If everyone has a way to get this opportunity ,
And the world is going to be the same thing .
But I was particularly focused on people like me
I mean , we &apos;re going to be the majority of the people
So we should get the opportunity to communicate with other people .
So I &apos;m really glad you have this activity
I love all of you who love TED .
If you don &apos;t mind _UNK_ back , I &apos;ll _UNK_ the TED _UNK_ .
like _UNK_ and everyone else you &apos;re going to see today .
The _UNK_ of these friends came from my real life .
There &apos;s a little bit like a aunt in my mom &apos;s house .
My parents also sent me to the U.N. school .
You know , she taught us the primary French ,
And she was very , very , very _UNK_ .
You know , you know , in the classroom ,
She was very elegant , but she was very tired .
And she told us that in the classroom
to talk about the _UNK_ of life .
We were 11 years old , and it was not appropriate .
This experience was particularly because I was the only black girl .
Well , that &apos;s my teachers and my friends .
A lot of them until today I was very good friends .
I just want to say that at night ,
My name is _UNK_ thank you for the opportunity
The TED name has spread all over the world .
Sarah Jones told me that we could have the opportunity
because you know I &apos;m a human _UNK_ .
My work is often going to go to Washington ,
where I had to go to all kinds of meetings to deal with politicians
I always tell them how often they eat _UNK_
But I &apos;m happy to be able to attend your activity
I hope there are more time to be with you , but only next time I can see it .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m not going to let all my friends meet you .
But I really want you to see some other friends that you should recognize them .
First of all , I &apos;m going to tell you
I am the Chinese community in New York City .
But when Sarah Jones had me come to TED ,
At first I said that I didn &apos;t know how to do that ,
If I &apos;m in front of a couple of years ago ,
because I think it &apos;s not good for me to speak English .
But I thought I &apos;d like to be a governor like _UNK_
She told me I was always talking to a joke
My husband and I came here with our son and my daughter .
is that there was no freedom in China at that time .
We &apos;re trying to teach our children to be proud of their tradition , but it &apos;s hard .
You know , as an immigrant , I &apos;m going to talk to kids about Chinese .
but they used to answer me with English .
to the age of marrying the _UNK_ .
we want them to be able to _UNK_ the culture
My son said he was not going to marry .
He has a girlfriend , but she &apos;s not a Chinese .
I &apos;m not talking about the bad times , but I said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with the Chinese girl ? &quot;
And I think he would change his mind
And then I decided to focus on my daughter
The wedding of the daughter is very special for her mother .
She just wanted to be with her friends
She was basically _UNK_ when she was a college .
She didn &apos;t want me to go to school .
I blame my daughter with a secret boyfriend .
But she told me that your mother doesn &apos;t worry about boys .
I mean , men are a difficult problem , but all women have to be used .
And she said , &quot; No , my mom , I don &apos;t like boys . &quot;
I &apos;ve always taught my children to respect Americans .
But I said to my daughter that this problem is an exception .
She wasn &apos;t gay she was just _UNK_ by the American problem .
She said she fell in love with a Chinese girl .
And these are the things that I want to hear
I didn &apos;t know what to do when I started .
But after a while I began to understand that she was really a man
And what I want to share with you is that this is what I know .
It &apos;s getting more and more _UNK_ because there are places like TED .
I think TED has a big impact on our lives .
I &apos;d like to thank Sarah Jones for the first time .
because I was the only Arab one that had to give me a lot of pressure .
And I felt that some of the _UNK_
And I saw some of them come to the conference ,
I promise you will add credit to you .
And although I knew I didn &apos;t look like a native person ,
What I &apos;m saying is that we live in the world
We don &apos;t have a lot of difference between us .
If you allow me to share a poem with you ,
This is a poem when I was 16 .
When I _UNK_ you , I feel so happy
My dear , I couldn &apos;t hide the feelings I couldn &apos;t hide .
Maybe it sounds a little bit familiar because in the same period in my life ,
So what I &apos;d like to say is that I would like to believe
And although some words are deliberately deliberately _UNK_ us to listen to each other ,
But the _UNK_ _UNK_ into the ear until the heart _UNK_ through the continent .
I pray that we will continue to discover self
And that &apos;s why thank you for the opportunity
I want to thank Chris and _UNK_ and everyone of you .
I took a long time to come here and I felt like I had a family .
I know some of the companies I showed you before .
But here &apos;s the most wonderful audience I &apos;ve ever seen
All this is so amazing that you &apos;re going to _UNK_ yourself .
and to introduce the background of our country
There &apos;s a lot of things to say about it .
and what has been done in the world
You know why I and how to encourage this step today .
As my parents finished their school abroad , we returned to our country .
when I was doing a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I could only afford to repair my mother for 13 years .
And that explained why many of our professionals
So , don &apos;t we have to turn this into the fact that we can &apos;t change ,
Are we all trained , and after leaving , we &apos;re not back ?
For better estimate Nigeria , this is a map of Nigeria ,
which is known as the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
Sometimes I feel that oil in Nigeria has _UNK_ us .
But the slide came out of this slide
I &apos;m going to talk about it . _UNK_ introduced why
There is a gap between Africa and other parts of the world .
Do you think there are some people on the taxi ?
It &apos;s a taxi to believe that it &apos;s a taxi in Nigeria .
in the last _UNK_ of Nigeria -- _UNK_ ,
It was a taxi and the police sat on it .
So , tell me , you think there are some policemen on the top ? Now , three .
I believe that in _UNK_ is not just the police .
And we sat there , and I sat there ,
And the picture made me think about what to do , if anybody
In this car it fell , and the accident was in urgent need of hospital .
Whatever you believe , some people are really alive .
It was true that there was malaria , we were _UNK_ to HIV .
And I told my family , my wife warned me every time ,
Do you know , every time you get that country , you &apos;re taking your life risk .
You all know . If you really need emergency care ,
whether any type of type -- if it happens ,
And there &apos;s a lot of accidents , and there &apos;s an accident ,
when they need to help this thing , where do they go ?
It &apos;s not just the accidents that I mentioned , but also ,
AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria , _UNK_ -- and so on .
I mean , when they were in my position , what would they do ?
When I got home -- I &apos;m going to do all kinds of things .
I want to teach , but if I get a disease ,
Or a chronic disease , where are they going to go ?
What &apos;s going to happen when they &apos;re dead or disabled ?
I think it &apos;s amazing . This is where they go .
These are not old photographs , these people are not _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ . In fact , this is a major training hospital in Nigeria .
It &apos;s in a operating room that &apos;s less than a year .
I &apos;m sorry if this makes you feel uncomfortable , but
I think you have to look at this , and this is the ground .
and I &apos;m not in poverty for the sake of health .
I want to say that we need not just vaccines ,
In a proper hospital , if I had an accident or _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , young people , you &apos;re a heart expert in the United States ,
Can you go home with me and do it ? &quot;
I want them to think , &quot; There &apos;s still hope . &quot;
So , look at this , this is the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ and emergency care -- look at the bag .
It was made of tape and the tape was stopped in Britain .
If there &apos;s something like this , in the U.K. ,
That &apos;s where they go . That &apos;s my job care care ward .
This is a slide that I &apos;m talking about .
We &apos;re _UNK_ it as a &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
because the ward was very scary , but we needed it .
to tell us what is not reward , right ?
I think we all know , but some of the speakers that I had before ,
and a couple of times will tell us more about it .
These are some of them . So what do I do ?
And here , we &apos;re going to be doing this .
We &apos;re going to do the breast surgery , and I &apos;m the only British ,
Other nine people are Americans , including heart surgeon ,
We all went out and we &apos;ve done three times now .
And I want you to know , I really believe in _UNK_ ,
I also believe in charity . They have an effect .
But what if they meet the accidents or diseases that we talked about before ?
because it &apos;s not everybody can enjoy it .
Health is wealth , and the words of _UNK_
The first thing to be healthy is to be _UNK_ faster .
just _UNK_ this place for two days , but look at it ,
We are committed to this , but he looks happy ?
Yes , this is the committee &apos;s medical advice ,
&quot; Yes , I &apos;ve told you that you &apos;re not doing it ,
Look , that &apos;s our _UNK_ . So , what do you do ?
I persuaded him to come with me . _UNK_ , and come from Britain .
Look , it &apos;s often the problem we have in Nigeria and in Africa .
or you can &apos;t fix it . It &apos;s not wrong ,
And as long as we can use it , we can continue .
But we have difficulty , we have a serious problem .
He must open the phone , the guy is always talking to the phone .
It looks like all Americans are looking at this .
Yeah , there &apos;s an Englishman , he &apos;s not going to do anything ,
He thought he was an Englishman , in fact he was _UNK_ ,
But it &apos;s just one of them , and even more old than you see ,
And the reason to give this photograph , this is a _UNK_ ,
is to tell you where we are , how to look at _UNK_ .
Can you see where ? It &apos;s on the windows .
You see _UNK_ on the screen , and you look at the diagnosis ,
and then send it out . But we also have _UNK_
I know that it &apos;s not AIDS , it &apos;s not malaria ,
But we still need to do that .
It &apos;s just trying to get kids ready , _UNK_ ready .
Or someone believed that science , they came to check
The oxygen saturation is the oxygen saturation and is normal .
When she was a child she should be treated .
We &apos;ve got to do for adults . We &apos;re really successful , so we &apos;re doing it .
We &apos;ve got to do for adults . We &apos;re really successful , so we &apos;re doing it .
We &apos;ve got to do for adults . We &apos;re really successful , so we &apos;re doing it .
But you can see that all the different things are going to happen
because the people who make the equipment don &apos;t do that .
because the people who make the equipment don &apos;t do that .
This is our first patient , just out of _UNK_ ,
This is our first patient , just out of _UNK_ ,
This is our first patient , just out of _UNK_ ,
We , _UNK_ , have done that simple condition and insisted that long ,
We don &apos;t have any condition to do anything .
Thank you . This is my first company -- _UNK_ .
The only purpose of it is to offer me anything that needs .
So we put our hand in the pocket and said , &quot; You know , let &apos;s do it . &quot;
We founded a company to teach knowledge , education people
to give them the tools that they need .
when you buy a breath in the hospital ,
to buy a transport . It can do anything ,
As long as the price of half , there is no compressed air .
If you don &apos;t know this in the United States , we know ,
because it &apos;s our commitment to finding out
What is suitable for Africans -- is the appropriate price
to work , so we continue to study . _UNK_ ,
This small part , like you don &apos;t have a _UNK_ license ,
Yes , it &apos;s going to take solar panels , it &apos;s got solar power ,
But if you have electricity , you charge the batteries here .
What &apos;s there ? We also designed the pedal pedal to prevent it .
If you can find a car , the battery has electricity
you can plug it in , or you can do it .
Do you want to use _UNK_ , or is the usual surgery ?
Now we &apos;re studying oxygen . In the field oxygen supply .
_UNK_ is a very old technology , a new one
And I want to have a couple of months
is the ability to use renewable energy systems
to make oxygen . _UNK_ -- this is not new --
The _UNK_ can remove the nitrogen in the air , and nitrogen accounted for the air _UNK_ .
_UNK_ the nitrogen , what &apos;s left ? The oxygen , a lot of oxygen .
So this is not new , we &apos;re going to do it .
These are the basic characteristics of my device .
It &apos;s got a _UNK_ , it &apos;s signed by _UNK_ ,
and the _UNK_ logo , probably nobody knows , it &apos;s in Europe .
If you compare the goods in the market , the price is cheaper ,
This is in _UNK_ , Mr. _UNK_ &apos;s home ,
People who are familiar with _UNK_ may know .
We are so many people in the room ,
_UNK_ Hans _UNK_ , who was my _UNK_ --
If the space is represented by the biggest attention ,
That &apos;s the question . But what we really need is Africa &apos;s solution
to be in Africa , to look at their culture .
Look at the people , look at the money they earn .
the people in Africa , because they took passion ,
There are a lot of sacrifice there there .
You have to do that . The people in Africa have to do it ,
I &apos;m going to talk about _UNK_ in 2000 , but I don &apos;t have a telephone .
I was going to have a lecture in 2003 .
about _UNK_ Foundation and Social _UNK_ . There &apos;s no telephone call .
And the first year we did it , or we didn &apos;t call it ,
But I &apos;m going to go back to the top
I first came to Hollywood in the Silicon Valley
But I found a lot of good now in Hollywood
to have their own media companies as well .
And I found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
than I think that there are more _UNK_
Hollywood has its sexy logo , Silicon Valley has its sexy logo .
Hollywood has its own _UNK_ , Silicon Valley ,
So there are a lot of common _UNK_
But I &apos;m going to tell you a story today .
Part of my personal story . When Chris invited me to speak ,
He said people thought I was a little bit _UNK_
They wanted to know what my power was .
My real motivation -- a vision of the future
a world of peace and prosperity and _UNK_
We &apos;ve heard so many of these things
And you see that there &apos;s a lot of
This is the wish of every one of us .
The two biggest mistakes in the world today
And this is why poverty , _UNK_ disease ,
and all the sin that we have around us
But the larger gap is probably what we call &quot; hope gap &quot;
I don &apos;t know where this bad thought came out .
that ordinary people can &apos;t make any impact on the world .
So the first chapter begins today , from us
because every one of us has the ability
and the opportunity of &quot; _UNK_ &quot; and &quot; hope &quot;
can &apos;t change the world , not know who &apos;s going to be .
And for me , it starts in the early days ,
And the family often goes to New York City
There was a summer that was really _UNK_ ,
except for my sister &apos;s _UNK_ , or reading ,
And I was reading the writers who read
And the world in their story is a _UNK_ .
And I thought that if I could write something ,
to describe the _UNK_ of the world .
may lead people to something that affects us .
and we &apos;re going to be able to change change .
I know that it &apos;s not the best way to make a living .
So I decided to go ahead and seek the freedom of financial freedom .
to write these stories as soon as possible .
And one of the things that happened to me at 14
and he said that he had cancer , and the _UNK_
He said that he was afraid of death .
but he didn &apos;t finish what he wanted to do .
God &apos;s good luck , he &apos;s still alive today .
But it was a _UNK_ experience for a young man .
One can never know how much time you have .
So I had a strong _UNK_ , and I was a professional
I think that will give me the freedom of financial freedom
One of these companies is a computer rental business .
I think I &apos;m going to do a lot of business .
I was going to go to Stanford Business School .
And there I met a friend of mine
named _UNK_ , who &apos;s here today . _UNK_ , I apologize to you .
This is a picture of a long time ago
And when I just graduated , _UNK_ came to me
But then , in 1996 , _UNK_ and I quit my full-time job .
_UNK_ eBay , the rest of the story , you all know .
It &apos;s one of the most famous enterprises in the world today .
hundreds of millions of people in the world --
But for me , this is a real change .
I set up a house with five men in _UNK_
And then , suddenly , I had all the resources
And so , how do you think about it ?
the _UNK_ of these wealth is shared with the world .
He was the architect of the great social plan
And I asked him what I could do .
John said , &quot; To help good people do good things .
to help people do what they do .
with their own wisdom and all kinds of powerful ways
For some examples , like _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
to get people out of poverty in the world .
And there &apos;s a lot of people like him ,
For example , _UNK_ was founded in Africa ,
By today , she has provided education for more than _UNK_ women .
He produced the first _UNK_ to cure the _UNK_ .
And she wanted to be able to _UNK_ this thing
in the developing world , in the developing world ,
And these things are the philosophy of change .
and it means that when you find people who are good at things ,
as much as TED is going to be connected .
It &apos;s not just to celebrate the good things they do .
but what they do is they can help _UNK_ .
And this is the final part of the task .
It reminds me of what I was a kid ,
I &apos;d like to take this thing to everybody ,
In fact , I don &apos;t need myself , I just look for a _UNK_ .
The next light is something better than writing .
For example , film , television can be greater impact on people
I can think of the movies that I &apos;m going to power .
I started thinking about who was doing this .
So in 2003 , I was in Los Angeles
to create a media company that focus on social interests .
and you get a lot of &quot; encourage &quot;
is , &quot; The streets of Hollywood are all around you .
Think it would be a loser in the movie . &quot;
And of course , there are other words ,
is to get a _UNK_ to do a movie industry . &quot;
And although _UNK_ , in January 2004 , I started _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I hope he can be a global media company
We don &apos;t want people to see our movies .
And then a laugh at the end of the day ,
We &apos;re trying to get you to participate in these social problems .
In 2005 , we issued a number of records ,
We finally got 11 Oscar nomination for the film .
And that year is really important for us .
tens of thousands of people are joining our initiative
We have partner in our society , for example , _UNK_ ,
in Sierra _UNK_ , once people saw movies ,
you know they can do something , change the world .
And one of these is called &quot; No _UNK_ . &quot;
But this is a film from _UNK_ _UNK_
And at the same time we issued this film ,
Congress is talking about preventing the _UNK_ Act for women .
And this is a big thing to me because it &apos;s
about a _UNK_ woman who _UNK_ her boss ,
and became a case of _UNK_ , _UNK_ the opportunity of _UNK_ .
because this film tells the story about it .
to help the _UNK_ of the good theme .
I first saw Al Gore doing a talk
And then I wanted to know something about global warming .
It &apos;s just about 50 years or so ,
And I knew that there was an emergency situation
And I went to _UNK_ and found Mr. Gore ,
And there was _UNK_ and _UNK_ in this room ,
Davis was at the time of _UNK_ _UNK_
And in Al Gore we decided to make his speech
And we thought that this could convey the information to the world
And he went to talk all over the world
A lot of people who face 100 or 200 audience
And I think that &apos;s really what I think is
And it also gave us a shock .
Now it &apos;s England , and the students in Scotland have to look at it .
We gave the American high school teacher to _UNK_ 50,000 DVD .
It changed people &apos;s discussion about global warming .
And this year , it &apos;s very important to Al Gore .
Al Gore is now known as the global warming ,
We are focused on the big problems in the world .
Now there &apos;s a 10 movies that are _UNK_
a war called _UNK_ Wilson , Tom and Julia _UNK_ ,
What I &apos;m talking about is that _UNK_ Wilson
how the Taliban _UNK_ the real story in Afghanistan .
The other film is &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
It &apos;s based on the novel _UNK_ , another story about Afghanistan .
is going to be more profound about some parts of the world .
The Chicago _UNK_ will first be at _UNK_ this year .
It _UNK_ the _UNK_ of democracy in 1968 .
This story again shows that these are made of personal _UNK_
Another film about the _UNK_ of _UNK_
In _UNK_ , we &apos;ve been following his latest _UNK_ activity
You know , this book is not controversial .
This is not a good _UNK_ for our film .
And finally , I want to say that every person has the opportunity ,
and it &apos;s going to be a lot of different ways
whether you &apos;re a technical _UNK_ or a _UNK_ ,
People in the _UNK_ , or the _UNK_ can be used .
and we can do more and more of it .
We can get the opportunity , the hope of _UNK_
The headlines of the newspaper ought to be this :
I like this one of the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And finally , a big slide on eBay &apos;s list ,
So thank you for my talk today ,
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do , _UNK_ movement .
in the _UNK_ of the prison in _UNK_ .
You can also see the fence on the _UNK_ .
In _UNK_ , it was a big time for us .
over the course of the thousand people ,
because I was a woman and a mother ,
When I left Cape Town , I left South Africa ,
and said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to do this
and Nelson Mandela &apos;s hometown of South Africa
And the virus in South Africa is _UNK_ .
If I &apos;m out of this lobby now ,
And a few years later , I was very _UNK_ ,
He was wearing the _UNK_ that I was wearing now .
Because of the AIDS _UNK_ , we can put it in the _UNK_ .
and said , &quot; Of course we can talk about this topic .
We &apos;re going to be able to _UNK_ AIDS .
Most of the money we raise is _UNK_
and they &apos;re going to start this movement in South Africa .
and I &apos;m going to go around the world .
This is a concert in Hong Kong to raise money .
and they don &apos;t know how to do it .
So I had the opportunity to take a moment
with the African choir that I love .
And one of the members of the _UNK_
This is in New York , and I &apos;m going to go together .
And through these ways , I &apos;ve raised my influence ,
And they want to be able to do it
But we believe that through government participation , we can achieve goal .
But we all have a lot of smiles because we are certain
and it &apos;s going to be taken care of .
We saw her in a hospital in _UNK_ ,
We spent a afternoon with her , she was a lovely girl .
And when we go out of this hospital ,
We could not expect her to work , even though we did a film for her .
And it was obvious that this meeting had
I don &apos;t know if you look at it ,
But it &apos;s all _UNK_ because they know what I &apos;m going to blow you .
and the sound of the _UNK_ comes up .
I think you &apos;re all _UNK_ to this transition .
We &apos;re going to put them in a mess .
_UNK_ : The potential message in this video
The program may be _UNK_ to some groups .
It &apos;s a little _UNK_ for the users ,
It may be used in tissue violence attack .
and ignore many , or most of them ,
in our digital life _UNK_ what we can &apos;t do .
After all , even the leaders of the free world
If you want to go to the office in the next year ,
The picture on the left is a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
as much as possible to _UNK_ the documents
But some of the files were kept in the _UNK_ ,
In _UNK_ this year , the _UNK_ system began to recover --
But in _UNK_ , how do you deal with
There &apos;s a lot of people who support the revolution
But there are some words that need to limit ,
because it &apos;s too violent and probably _UNK_ our democracy . &quot;
How do you decide who has the power to make these decisions
The good man was _UNK_ on the other side .
And even though it was not his _UNK_ ,
The U.S. government and some companies are dealing with _UNK_ .
Amazon website stop _UNK_ for _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Of course , Facebook has occupied most of the world &apos;s _UNK_ --
And this is a good thing to do ,
Some of them are helpful to the Western technology .
This is a ceremony I took in 2009 ,
In Russia , it is generally not _UNK_ the Internet .
So there &apos;s a situation in the world today ,
It &apos;s not a bad thing to help good people .
The most pressing problem we need to ask today
But what do we feel about this pattern ,
This law has been in the freedom of speech .
The interest in protecting the citizens &apos;s rights is higher .
and decided that it was going to be done .
This is the result of dozens of years of movement ,
and to abide by some basic rules .
And this leads to the idea of &quot; The _UNK_ &quot; --
that every one of us is really important .
is not the opposite of the people in the world .
So , I want you to wake up
Now , it &apos;s calm to deal with the current
There &apos;s an organization that has been around us .
I would like to call the &quot; _UNK_ economy &quot;
But first of all , I want to take you back
It &apos;s important to me that this is important to me .
I used to _UNK_ the books across Iron _UNK_
and finally became the _UNK_ of the BBC
the ones that were in front of the Eastern Europe
is influenced by the change of Eastern Europe .
They used to meet the Olympic Games in _UNK_
in the middle of the city , with a high grade apartment
They can travel free to the west countries .
It may be _UNK_ , but they play an important role
or I &apos;d like to call them a little bit
And in this case , a businessman should have
to make sure that the effectiveness of your contract ?
In fact , he might go to the _UNK_
are all together in _UNK_ to 1991 .
And the economy is going to fall down
The workers &apos; markets are never going to be the _UNK_ .
the people who were committed to the _UNK_
So I started thinking about the hidden hidden _UNK_
And I decided to go around the world
In addition , it &apos;s going to talk directly to _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ region is a place for the beginning of the survey .
where the laws and order have been _UNK_ .
In addition , like what the retail sector says ,
And what I found in the beginning was that
_UNK_ has become a big _UNK_ area .
the illegal goods that come from all over the world
They would like to spend some time and _UNK_
using the same model as the other big business .
And then , of course , the consumer sector
In the last 18 months , there were 6,000 people
It &apos;s not a conflict you can read in the newspaper .
Why is this ? Because the _UNK_ of the world
In 2000 , the _UNK_ of the world
You can see the _UNK_ on the cell phone
The _UNK_ of the Congo sold these things to _UNK_ .
and then _UNK_ these things into the Western market .
Now , let me show you some of my friends that are working on ,
Now , the cigarettes produced by the factory are very cheap
But the EU asked them to pay the highest tax in the world .
So if you could get a cigarette into the European Union ,
And I want to show you a little bit
The cost of this ship is a million _UNK_ .
And the money was used in the _UNK_ war ,
There are only two _UNK_ that can run faster
It &apos;s important because the only way to grab them
So the police have to go to rescue these people ,
What is the criminal &apos;s worth doing with the money ?
because it &apos;s not just the rule of _UNK_ the world .
The last 20 years is a time to celebrate with champagne .
Since 1990 , we &apos;ve seen financial centers around the world
And there &apos;s a lot of legal banks that are happy
The source of these problems is that the _UNK_ bank
has become the core of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
If you want to stop the illegal tax ,
The good news is that there are some people in the White House
And if anybody has a problem like me ,
and he would spend his life in jail
It made him a _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ group .
So how many of the Wall Street have been on Wall Street ?
I can tell you that a lot of things
Let &apos;s come up with an organization of crime .
drugs . This is the second picture of the _UNK_ factory .
are all the things that are available in this business .
to see some of the things that are _UNK_ .
So the market in California is very good .
And this is for the main exporters ,
It was exactly what happened in the last month .
Canada has become an important production and distribution area
because the pills are improving their effects .
because it &apos;s going to move from developing countries
it will be beyond the ability of our Western police officers .
We &apos;ve been _UNK_ by the _UNK_ police
And it has no rules and control systems .
It &apos;s like a gun in the forehead .
people don &apos;t have a lot of drugs , they don &apos;t often find _UNK_ .
I &apos;d like to introduce you to Mr. _UNK_ .
Or more accurately , Mr. _UNK_ , the Spanish Spanish ,
I was _UNK_ by a Brazilian network criminal .
We sat in the car and we stopped in _UNK_ .
The network crime is actually something that we call social engineering .
that people are going to use their computers
When the network _UNK_ found the fastest channel
And of course , it &apos;s directly _UNK_ the wallet
I think you should remember &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
He was one of the most successful viruses in the world .
And when this virus came up , I was lucky
And she had a lot of emotion and feelings
And when I saw these letters in my house ,
We know that the network is about criminal _UNK_
And when they get free lunch they can _UNK_ our blood ,
The researchers are worried about the production of resistance
is because of the drugs that _UNK_ can &apos;t afford
is going to have a relationship between the _UNK_ .
And we need to be very serious about this .
When Chris asked me to do my first talk at TED , I refused to let him .
because I don &apos;t think I can &apos;t do that .
with the audience , but that &apos;s what I want to do .
But he explained to me that he was in trouble
And he couldn &apos;t find any particular attraction
and the people who are famous at TED are _UNK_ .
I said , well , _UNK_ -- I mean to Chris . But I &apos;m going to have two conditions .
First : I &apos;d like to be as early as possible , best to start my talk in the morning .
So the second thing I want to choose is to be a TED Talk
Fortunately , he agreed ! You &apos;ll see my talk after two years .
In fact , it wasn &apos;t a photograph , but the guy was rather cheap ,
_UNK_ , a wonderful day , full of praise . Let me wish .
You and your family ! I know the arrival of this letter will be _UNK_ .
But it &apos;s not surprising to you that it &apos;s not for you .
As the old _UNK_ said , _UNK_ was hard to find ,
But their echo is big . So I &apos;m going to find you directly .
This is for you to ensure my life safety and _UNK_ my honesty .
If I were to prison , I would accept any _UNK_ .
_UNK_ used to be a financial minister in western _UNK_ countries .
You know , your country is a very suitable country for economic investment .
Your people are very _UNK_ in business .
And he had about two million dollars .
to repair the dam in the national scale .
before the war had happened . When the war had happened ,
The chief asked my father to give him money ,
But my father insisted that this was not his property .
He was murdered because he refused to _UNK_ the money .
At the same time , only my mother knew the money .
I soon reached a agreement with the _UNK_ _UNK_
He would take the money to the _UNK_ airport in the free town .
They didn &apos;t know what was going on in the case .
There was a pretty safe security company in the capital of _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t want to invest these money in _UNK_ .
It was because there was no good economic situation , and my country was almost different .
I want you to give me a hand , and I know you can help me .
to accept this money and trust in your account ;
Third , accept this money and trust under your account .
Take out the commission you need , and leave the surplus money .
I was told when I was in the _UNK_ , I would have 18 minutes
So , to make this cool , I &apos;m here for three minutes !
I mean , no , I mean , I mean , isn &apos;t that ?
Like 1,000 , 2,000 people in some ways ? Oh , oh ?
Yes , yesterday night I went out with some Google guys .
They told me that Google software is very advanced .
It &apos;s going to serve you for life and Google ,
So it can predict what you &apos;re going to do .
like me , &quot; _UNK_ me , this is crazy . &quot;
But they say , &quot; No , but don &apos;t tell it out . &quot; But they &apos;re going to go out .
They said I could have the words I had to say .
For example , it will tell me . And I have to tell you
This is a real network browser , which is actually the Google website .
We &apos;re going to test the scene here today .
So what am I going to say ? Frank is me .
I &apos;m making my dance for _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
In Thursday , I &apos;m going to put it on the website ,
This is going to include some of my closest friends .
And as a invitation , I invite you to join
In a week , I got a phone call from the network ,
I &apos;m going to flow over 10 percent of the cost of _UNK_
I &apos;m going to leave my job without saying that .
But some people think I &apos;m not just a network expert ,
And complex philosophy , I &apos;m not going to know it ,
because it was a _UNK_ point to me , but --
And it makes the Internet become popular ,
Maybe I &apos;ll come back next year and talk about it .
I &apos;m obsessed with email . And I know a lot about
After four years , I could receive 200 to 300 letters a day .
They come from people I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a great opportunity for me .
to understand different cultures . Is it not that ?
It &apos;s like a microscope looking at the entire world .
You can even live in other people &apos;s lives .
And I &apos;ve got a lot of inspiration
They said , &quot; Hey , _UNK_ , are you _UNK_ , don &apos;t you ?
You can mix with us , &quot; I said , &quot; Why are you waiting ? &quot;
They said , &quot; Hey , _UNK_ , thank you for _UNK_ ,
but I mean we &apos;re going to get out of it .
I work with my fan , so I have to say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I know what you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re saying , &quot; _UNK_ ,
I had to say that this year was not me .
I guess Chris must believe this , because in the last few years ,
I guess there &apos;s some _UNK_ on the TED stage . I don &apos;t know .
So , this year , Chris _UNK_ the simulator to bring us a break .
It will make us feel the feelings of people on the stage
Let &apos;s take many times of our home practice , and we have plenty of experience for this talk .
I have to say that it &apos;s a great job here !
I want to tell you a little joke . But there &apos;s no big deal .
I want to say the last thing , I really want to say --
Thank you for the coming of you !
I fell in love with a _UNK_ shrimp .
They said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re doing this pile of stuff , these networks ,
I said , &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know if you realize this ,
I mean , like 100,000 dollars , I spent a year
These are _UNK_ . So I decided to try my skill ,
I think _UNK_ must enjoy the game of this game .
I &apos;ve tried to change the pattern before you &apos;ve done it .
&quot; Of course , it looks like &quot; atheist &quot; .
It &apos;s a very good game because you know it &apos;s 25 cents .
Chris used to say that in an email ,
I want it to be a little better this year .
And we &apos;re waiting for the second one --
What are we saying here ? Oh , just a technical joke .
because I got a lot of joy from the technology .
And I &apos;m here to say , despite the _UNK_ of my _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m not going to -- stick on . I &apos;m making things .
It really gives me a lot of fun .
This is a process of creating , and it keeps me in .
a kind of anxiety in my life .
This is what I did with 80 percent of the project ,
But I &apos;ve got a lot of things to do .
because you don &apos;t finish a thing , you can &apos;t start another thing .
And what I &apos;ve done is I &apos;m starting to do
to create a network of interest . In a network space to share with you .
We &apos;re _UNK_ culture . We can &apos;t use some software .
People would say they had to go to read the manual .
I tried to create some tiny activity .
I hope that these activities will allow people to express themselves .
Oh , I &apos;m on this page , but it &apos;s not there .
I create a competition called the Office _UNK_ .
The toilet is more than 500 in three weeks .
And people in the country are going to be
online _UNK_ -- you might have seen a lot of these things .
I think it &apos;s a great opportunity for people to draw a book
or with other things . I &apos;m very interested in this process ,
And the process of creating is that it &apos;s really interesting to me .
The problem is that a lot of people fall into the book .
They use such a way to relieve . Like , draw some characters .
In the end , they stopped to do this kind of thing .
They painted something like a little _UNK_ .
So , such a poor writer tried to create tools of reproductive capability .
You can also draw some _UNK_ . This is a painting .
Add up your creation , like a German _UNK_ technology .
And that &apos;s what you can do -- in fact , your drawing technology will become better .
even though it was bad . We went on , we started drawing ,
Here &apos;s some of my favorites . This is a tiny _UNK_ .
It &apos;s _UNK_ to me . It &apos;s very _UNK_ !
I mean , this is incredible . This is a _UNK_ girl .
I &apos;m actually dead . In fact , it &apos;s not a joke .
But I think this is a very interesting , wonderful thing .
So this is called _UNK_ . This is a network space .
This is -- in general , this is a _UNK_ block of information .
There &apos;s no Japanese poetry that &apos;s the same person ,
Every line is written out of different people .
And I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to put this up , _UNK_ up , &quot;
Miss _UNK_ came to me , now _UNK_ , and she started to act . &quot;
I &apos;ll tell you that this is an amazing way .
If you , or your couple , you can come to _UNK_ ,
and say , &quot; Let me talk about &quot; -- this is not the end of your heart .
but to get people together and do some happy things .
This is just the _UNK_ activity , but I think it &apos;s important .
to develop more social capital for more people .
I want to show you the last thing .
They &apos;re going to inspire us and teach us
And they can &apos;t wait to get this particular object out of the boat ,
And this particular thing is , &quot; Why are we going to be different from chimpanzees ? &quot;
How close humans and chimpanzees , there is almost no difference in genes .
If I &apos;m a good _UNK_ , I have to believe
If we change that , it must be affected by certain factors .
In 50 years , there was a simple question called _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ of the apes left the tree
We have to stand upright to see the _UNK_
So we have to throw away the _UNK_ coat
But in the &apos; 90s , some of the things are starting to be _UNK_
and the _UNK_ are at the same time .
_UNK_ also looked at animals , and they were not _UNK_ animals .
And then they found a smart way to analyze
These _UNK_ plants are suspended in the rainforests .
and it &apos;s starting to work around with two legs .
He said , &quot; Well , what I said to you in the last 20 years . &quot;
We have to go back to the beginning , and everything started
It makes him very popular . They don &apos;t want to go back to the beginning .
And what you &apos;re going to do here is ,
The _UNK_ of the trust in this respect is _UNK_ .
What do you do ? How do you deal with scientists like this ?
What do you think he says ? &quot; They continue to happen when they continue . &quot;
If they don &apos;t even have a paradigm , they don &apos;t ask questions .
And that &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear them talk . It &apos;s a _UNK_ .
Some of them will increase the height of the principle .
&quot; Is it time to stop the _UNK_ pressure ?
I mean , why don &apos;t we talk about chromosomes , genes ?
He couldn &apos;t see it from his heart ,
You &apos;re going to _UNK_ the species directly out of the window .
is that this _UNK_ the paradigm system .
And we don &apos;t have to wait for the new paradigm .
When the media knew his theory , the response was almost _UNK_ .
And at that time , this was the last thing .
And I think _UNK_ is a reason for him
and that &apos;s what we do with other species .
And obviously , every time we think about it ,
when you lose the animal of the body ,
I said , &quot; No , I &apos;m going to talk about it . &quot;
That crazy woman , she said , what &apos;s going to tell her ?
But now everybody agreed that the elephant was a _UNK_ .
It became consensus that all the naked animals
In the meantime , _UNK_ are considered to be the final case .
And last year , in Florida found the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
It is said that most of the time in water
So , exposed skin and water are closely connected
And as a fully sufficient condition , it &apos;s only _UNK_ .
in its lifetime , through the test of water ,
or the _UNK_ of the water . I think it &apos;s important .
It has never been able to touch the surface .
This is a unique one of these things .
because we are the only human being walking upright
But we can say that all the apes and the apes
And that was when they went through the _UNK_ ,
In our skin , there is a layer of fat
It &apos;s not like the other _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
If you look at the _UNK_ , you know ,
The parcel was wrapped in the kidney , _UNK_ , etc .
And the _UNK_ is located under the skin .
There is no fat inside the body , all in the _UNK_ .
It can be said to other _UNK_ , so it &apos;s absolutely impossible to _UNK_ .
And this is the teeth , the lungs don &apos;t have any relationships .
It &apos;s just about the breathing control of the _UNK_ .
You &apos;re trained to have a sense of &quot; Ah , &quot;
The only kind of animal has a consciousness control .
And this is the necessary condition of speech .
And also , the _UNK_ form of our body
My body is very close to fish .
For _UNK_ years , I &apos;ve been working on this idea
The _UNK_ said that the false _UNK_ were false .
And every time I say , how do they respond ?
And one of the things that I &apos;m talking about is that
And at first they did a serious study
For _UNK_ years , I &apos;ve been looking for evidence
Now I &apos;m going to conclude that this is a rumor
And of course they don &apos;t believe it , but they love it .
And I would ask , &quot; Why do you think this is _UNK_ ? &quot;
The answer is , &quot; Yeah , they can all be wrong ! &quot;
There are many examples in history that most people are wrong .
If you have a scientific problem like this ,
is that it &apos;s not a vote on a _UNK_ .
And they said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s better than those who say , &quot;
In addition , there are more _UNK_ than other ones .
Now we &apos;re going to look forward to the future .
At least one of the things that will happen
In the next 40 years , 50 years , or 60 years , they might say ,
We don &apos;t want to say it , we &apos;re going to do something else .
It &apos;s not a _UNK_ , it &apos;s not in water , it &apos;s this !
If you look back at the early century ,
There was a lot of differences , argument and _UNK_
And I thought , &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to happen . &quot;
And for me , the _UNK_ of _UNK_
because I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m more than George _UNK_ ,
&quot; At my age , I &apos;m not going to have a big age when I &apos;m young ,
And all of this is going to happen .
The teaching _UNK_ doesn &apos;t even mention our naked skin .
And we never had the opportunity to contact it .
I don &apos;t know where the order is coming from .
And if you want to make a difference in this field ,
If you believe in _UNK_ , you &apos;d better keep your mouth .
He said , &quot; First of all , you have to refuse him
&quot; You &apos;re not afraid to _UNK_ the boat ( break ) . &quot;
You really pay a lot of attention to your problem .
I can tell you a little bit about
I &apos;ve been exploring the channel for a while
but not just because they don &apos;t have any sense .
There are two basic _UNK_ in the mind of politicians
Now , it &apos;s time to push this problem forward .
These animals are being reported all day ,
What is useless , and what method can make you think about
All right , it &apos;s often to face a robot talking .
Yes , they said , but they don &apos;t like that .
It &apos;s often difficult to get the effective response and communication
and it &apos;s a good conversation about it ,
I can tell you that every executive I &apos;ve worked on
So why don &apos;t you write a letter ?
First of all , you have to find a traditional device pen --
I know you &apos;re going to have a difficult time
And at least one month , you write a letter
not three months of related units will begin to call you .
Once you &apos;re going to ask you , &quot; How do you look at this ? &quot;
You need to know that near their risk
with some respect and a little bit of _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to give you a very simple idea
You may not appreciate each other &apos;s personal , you don &apos;t like anything else .
But you can _UNK_ them with a hard task .
When animals want to get what they want , they get it .
They don &apos;t take the time back and forth .
And in fact , you can go straight
Most of the time , if they found a retreat , they would choose all their body
&quot; If no one gives you these information , I &apos;ll help you . &quot;
to warn you or try to attack you
You will tell them when you sign this letter .
some of the projects you &apos;ve done , you &apos;re a _UNK_ .
First of all , you copied the local post office .
And then you send a post to the post office ,
If you do that , they call the phone , &quot; Do you have a copy ? &quot;
So some of these guys will tag on the _UNK_ ,
I have to tell you that we &apos;re all in a _UNK_
But the letters are a few times ,
The first time I was chosen by the National _UNK_ , I received this letter .
So once you do that , I promise you
you &apos;re going to be a _UNK_ in the jungle .
And it leads to a negative result :
This is a _UNK_ of energy change ,
I think that the sustainable home and the city
Now , to do that , we need a right language and natural dialogue .
And this is something that &apos;s transformed into another .
This is a way to convert local resources to sustainable data .
But this material doesn &apos;t exist , I &apos;m going to create them .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do
_UNK_ worked with a system called the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And it &apos;s like magic , and it looks like this .
is a _UNK_ . There &apos;s a chemical battery in it ,
that we have to do with our own life ,
Look , this is a _UNK_ cell , it &apos;s working out of the skin ,
It &apos;s kind of like the delivery of chemicals ,
This is a _UNK_ cell that can separate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
And they &apos;re _UNK_ , we can only get a part of it .
So what we do is we try to get these technologies
Our ancestors used them to be used in the building .
If you walk through the _UNK_ of today ,
And these days I love that --
You can see a lot of things done with _UNK_ .
You can see some little shells in the rock
and the bones are packed together with each other .
They &apos;re being _UNK_ for millions of years ,
But imagine what this rock would be like
Is it going to give this new property of brick ?
The most likely thing is that it can grow .
that may be able to repair itself ,
So when we want to think about more metabolism ,
are all the same as the town of Venice .
You know , Venice and the oceans are close to ,
So , we &apos;ve invented a kind of thing
and came up with a series of designs
that will allow the city to grow up .
Now , we &apos;re studying the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
We don &apos;t want these _UNK_ to _UNK_ in these beautiful _UNK_ .
We need them to grow in places where they are specified .
You know , the _UNK_ cells in your _UNK_
They can be far away from the light
They can move light , and you just choose the type of things
So , they &apos;re not in a single entity ,
Now , these cells are _UNK_ the _UNK_
But these are not the _UNK_ , they need some time .
It takes years to improve and monitoring technology
The biggest _UNK_ of the city in Venice
We &apos;re going to see the _UNK_ of a city at the bottom .
_UNK_ is a very large carbon _UNK_ process .
It will find itself in the _UNK_ system .
It &apos;s really fun , and now we have a kind of
This technology is all useful in any place .
And that means that this is a technology
And as the progress of the building ,
My best friend was killed in a car accident .
So I haven &apos;t succeeded , so this is just a report ,
And the main thing is , I &apos;ll introduce some of the non - driving vehicles .
will be awarded by the United States government .
So we decided to build a different car at Stanford ,
We also went to Los Angeles on a _UNK_ highway .
There &apos;s no artificial intervention in these processes ,
_UNK_ : Now I can &apos;t get my friend _UNK_ ,
But what I can do for other people .
is the first reason that young people die ?
Do you notice that almost all of these accidents
And then you can get rid of the highway ?
Now I &apos;m going to _UNK_ a new technology ,
it would be ridiculous to drive a car by people .
And the same problem is that in the east .
The people who first settled in this is kind of worried ,
In _UNK_ , _UNK_ passed the first _UNK_ method .
_UNK_ , a lot of people are willing to share water ,
The problem is that the whole West is now
that are more than the actual capacity of it .
and the risk of the economy that comes with .
This is not only a group of people ;
because if you believe that water resources will lose it .
I &apos;m sure everybody knows that this is in agriculture communities
and know that some of them are also happy .
And that was the beginning of the _UNK_
They care about the safety and the safety of the water ,
They &apos;re trying to really work on the water ,
But I want to tell you another story in _UNK_ ,
I bet you don &apos;t know , make a _UNK_ beer .
The production of a _UNK_ will consume more than 100 _UNK_ water .
but they still have to use millions of _UNK_ water .
So _UNK_ and their clients started to worry about ,
They &apos;re looking for some solutions that can solve problems .
So how can they solve this _UNK_ of water ?
Because you do not argue that your water resources will risk losing its risk .
Well , we decided to connect these two worlds --
And if they want to think about this right ,
He can protect water from other users in the stream .
He &apos;s hired to keep the water in the stream .
Each _UNK_ has a serial and a certificate ,
This provides economic support for the rural community .
We &apos;ve done more of the _UNK_ ecosystem
Many of the high - tech companies in the southwest are connected .
What is the happiest person in the world ?
How can you be the happiest person in the world ?
There are ways to detect the happiness of the people .
You can test the relative activity of the _UNK_ .
What did he think when he was tested ?
and it &apos;s important to me in my life .
to look at my work in a new way .
In the background of the economy , compassion is how it works .
because I had the right hand of my head
I know that there are other _UNK_ in the world .
Other employees are involved in this group , and the group
The first example is the biggest annual community activity --
They three know where India is in place .
_UNK_ had enough money to build this hospital ,
to help the _UNK_ find their relatives .
Two Google employees wrote in their work rules .
not as part of a big enterprise planning project ,
The first benefit from love is that it leads to high efficiency .
So what is the relationship between the leadership ?
They felt that there was no need to _UNK_ themselves .
the cognitive and emotional ingredients of compassion --
What I say is that in our minds --
_UNK_ can lead five stars to lead
I mean , you go to work in the morning
They just decided to go to the _UNK_ hospital in India
How can you get the people who are _UNK_ ?
One of our most famous managers joke about it .
And it &apos;s a lot of attention in the inner world .
But I &apos;m one of the _UNK_ and _UNK_ of this course
because Google believed that one of the engineers
So , what is the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ?
It means that we can look at the stream
that trust has a lot of good work .
at least it can be a reference
I want to end up with what I &apos;m going to do
I &apos;d like to quote his word -- this guy in _UNK_ , not others .
He said , &quot; If you want to make somebody happy ,
not only does it mean , but it has benefit .
I walked into a prison in _UNK_ in 1994
When I look at his eyes , I realized
And even though I &apos;ve written a couple of _UNK_
And I realized that at the time that
that the citizens have the right to hire lawyers
And there is the right to be _UNK_ .
I think we &apos;re going to be able to
And I believe that today is going to be
If we united the entire international society , we make a decision .
My husband was _UNK_ , and the police _UNK_ him . &quot;
And so _UNK_ didn &apos;t have any legal law .
I remember being trained for them , and I said ,
all of the students are quiet , and eventually ,
for a hundred people , but I never have to do it .
And then we talked about some of the facts :
And these _UNK_ need a lot of courage
and stood up , and everyone was behind her
and kept saying , &quot; _UNK_ , we &apos;re going to need
But one day there was a perfect case .
And she came to her , and she had nothing to do with her .
The judge stood up as soon as the judge was sent to the judge .
And they &apos;ve been starting to do it ,
I went into a prison in _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
And I was really cute , I said , &quot; You know , your children are really happy . &quot;
Mother told me , &quot; Yeah , because she came in . &quot;
who stole two pieces of _UNK_ and a tin .
And I found the _UNK_ of the prison
He said , &quot; Well , we can talk about it ,
But we found that the quality of the _UNK_
to help him in the same way .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , I said , &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to hear somebody else saying ,
And he said , &quot; But I want you to understand
And they told me that I was going to
And I said , &quot; But the _UNK_ has been
I said to them , &quot; I only have a problem .
is that the suspect came to the table
And I &apos;m talking to you about this , I know ,
And it sounds like , &quot; Oh , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
It sounds like we can solve the problem ? But is it true ? &quot;
But I have a lot of reasons to believe that it &apos;s completely possible .
The first reason is that people work in the grass
not just the _UNK_ that I told you about .
And I was sitting in one of these days
&quot; How are we going to do ? How can we talents ?
to the police station , and he started to claim
So I &apos;m going to talk about what we need
And the third is the most important thing .
I believe that if we can unite together ,
And I know that people are still _UNK_
At any time -- I know people would ask , &quot; What can I do ? &quot;
You know what you &apos;re going to be able to do .
I &apos;d like to tell you a story about the kid named _UNK_ .
And I saw him four years old ,
including the prison guard , so he &apos;s the only one .
And you know , there &apos;s a lot of _UNK_
and he had a big brain in his head .
And every day in jail , you know , you know ,
to visit everybody , but he really wanted to see
And sometimes the cell is a _UNK_ ,
Most of the prisoners were _UNK_ by the _UNK_
There was nothing to do in the prison .
There was no material to enjoy , but he had a kind of
I &apos;m going to do what I can do . &quot;
There is a belief that all the _UNK_ look like heaven .
I think of heaven as a very comfortable cloud ,
I can use my stomach on the top ,
As I was a child I looked at television , I gave my elbow a head .
And sometimes you have such a _UNK_ sense ,
like when you read in the subway in New York City ,
And the interesting thing is , from a certain degree , I have this _UNK_ life .
When I was 24 years old , I found that I was working with art
I decided to use this passion more than people .
In life , I &apos;m basically in the state of all things .
And when I looked around , I saw everything was just a long story start .
In 2004 , a _UNK_ exhibition was held as &quot; modest design . &quot;
We built a big building in the middle of the city , a big building ,
So we were in a very small country , very small .
It was one of the most interesting moments in my career .
So I started thinking , Max _UNK_ and all the Swiss designers
To _UNK_ _UNK_ , a new non - _UNK_ _UNK_ is designed .
The film is already beginning to play in my brain .
And of course , you can imagine the _UNK_ design ,
This is the same one that has been copied for hundreds of times .
And at the same time , I really hope that this exhibition
is really going to have the same effect on you .
The exhibition aims to make children think about what they do .
I hope they can walk into the kitchen and look at the closet , or their mother &apos;s _UNK_ ,
instead of having two _UNK_ on the plate .
just to give people the _UNK_ design of their eye .
And when you do that , usually , 80 percent advice you get are _UNK_ and only 20 percent .
But almost all of the suggestions are good advice .
For example , I didn &apos;t know that Spanish invented _UNK_ ,
So every _UNK_ says &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; and the Italian invented pizza .
But what I &apos;d like to show you is that same from _UNK_
And I &apos;ve just been able to do that .
This is the traffic _UNK_ , we call _UNK_ , it &apos;s _UNK_ .
Do you know that all Milan are using these beautiful concrete objects
You can send them to us as long as you are willing to welcome us .
But this exhibition let me know more about a problem ,
Since I entered the modern art museum I began to think about this problem , I &apos;ve been 13 years old .
To know that different places are different to the _UNK_ of things .
I was in Argentina and _UNK_ for a long time ,
In these countries the common way of building houses is very beautiful .
This is the other place , but the contemporary art is very poor .
The contemporary art does not take a lot of seats .
You don &apos;t have to go to the mall , and you get into a _UNK_ store ,
will find that there &apos;s a delicate design that makes everyone feel
And New York has another preference for modern art .
I &apos;ve been surprised . My three year-old kid knows who Richard is .
But design , for some reason , is still being _UNK_ .
And when I mentioned the word &quot; design , &quot;
A lot of people think about it -- in this case , really _UNK_ design ,
These are part of the design , but design can do more .
but it might be a design school in Jerusalem
Because , you know , Israel has given everyone of the baby &apos;s _UNK_ mask .
So what these _UNK_ do is find a way to lower the collar ,
Such as teenagers can be _UNK_ at the same time , rather than being _UNK_ .
The local people designed the baby &apos;s defense mask because of the baby .
can be _UNK_ by their parents because it &apos;s important to be close to the body ,
and then they can make a little tent for kids .
No matter how shallow it is , it &apos;s really a very good design .
And although this and design _UNK_ furniture is far away ,
but it was my passion that I had .
I did it from the beginning of the _UNK_
because it was really great to work there .
You &apos;re really _UNK_ , this ability can allow people to know your exhibition or show .
And this strength , because in a museum , I can &apos;t have too many visitors .
I know that 80 percent of the tourist are going to see _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
I &apos;ll try to stay there if they come to our house .
But what I &apos;ve been trying to do is the _UNK_ of my department
what has been done since the museum was built ,
is trying to figure out what &apos;s happening in the world ,
and use the power of design makes things better .
In fact , _UNK_ may be sitting in the _UNK_ right now .
Oh , I &apos;m always going to do it too well .
One is in _UNK_ , this is about organic furniture . The second game is _UNK_ ,
is the _UNK_ furniture that came back to the United States ,
There was a very good design at that time .
There &apos;s a lot of about architecture and design
&quot; design allows life to live better than that .
So , I started doing this from _UNK_ .
This is a new stage , in my opinion ,
In _UNK_ , the material can be designed to be applied .
And this allows me to get a lot of different design examples ,
At that time , these products were _UNK_ into the market .
At the same time , the work of _UNK_ had come up ,
He made these beautiful Salt _UNK_ and pepper _UNK_ with rice .
So , you see , the scope of these design is pretty wide .
And I &apos;m going to ask you a different design
when the new style of work in the world came up with ideas .
It &apos;s beautiful that it &apos;s called &quot; The _UNK_ . &quot;
And this idea is that if you have a _UNK_ ,
You can play a sky on your head , then you have your own _UNK_ .
Other examples are not _UNK_ . _UNK_ &apos;s attention is how to work on the way to work .
_UNK_ , my favorite _UNK_ , focused on how to work at home .
And it makes me want to introduce a very important idea about design .
And what they do is they &apos;re going to need human needs ,
and now in the economy , materials and sustainable problems .
And what they end up doing , if it &apos;s good ,
will be far superior to the set of parts .
You know , when everyone says , &quot; You really need to take a job apart ,
Instead , she said , &quot; _UNK_ , work and _UNK_ can live . &quot;
Well , it &apos;s like the pop TV meal in 2001 .
And although there &apos;s a lot of other exhibition ,
but I don &apos;t want to focus on my show .
_UNK_ , I want to talk about some great _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been very _UNK_ about this word ,
You know , 13 years ago I went to America until today ,
So this morning , I open the dictionary , and I talked about it .
There was a gentleman who had not been _UNK_ on his cattle ,
because it was designed to design a product ,
and for something that we &apos;ve lost before ,
or believe people will have a new behavior after they use it .
So , &quot; Safety &quot; is the final exhibition I did in _UNK_ .
It ended up in the beginning of the year ,
This exhibition is the design of safety and protection .
_UNK_ , so it began in 2001 , and it was called _UNK_ .
And then it happened , I didn &apos;t _UNK_ , and then I _UNK_ the exhibition .
The range of the exhibition comes from a complete set of _UNK_ equipment .
It &apos;s also , you know , I &apos;m working with _UNK_ .
Some of the things you see on his website are actually in the exhibition .
What &apos;s interesting is that we don &apos;t need to talk about design and art .
But design is all the tools that it can use .
This is an economic consciousness , and it &apos;s a sense of humor .
This is a very beautiful design from the South Africa .
The idea is that when you &apos;re in _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
The police are close to you , and you &apos;re wearing this coat .
It looks like a big heart , and it &apos;s got a _UNK_ in your heart ,
like a flowers in front of a _UNK_ gun .
And you can imagine that when a group of people dressed in the same coat ,
The collective _UNK_ will be _UNK_ by the police .
You know , _UNK_ sometimes does not make certain _UNK_ things ,
but they are very useful for our ideas .
A series of things that can reflect our _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
like this kind of furniture , it &apos;s made of wood on your floor ,
So it can never be seen , and you can _UNK_ it .
And the better one is a mushroom cloud ,
The discovery also gave me the best published in the American _UNK_ .
It was impossible to occur before the work of _UNK_ .
And this Michael _UNK_ can protect you from radiation .
But what &apos;s interesting in the exhibition is that
Some of the _UNK_ have started working on this special field .
that allowed them to ski , play tennis ,
to do anything they want to do , not worry about yourself .
_UNK_ is very young , I guess he may be 27 years old .
He made a series of toys for a _UNK_ child .
This is a toy , it looks like you &apos;re going to be ,
And the lonely child likes to be _UNK_ ,
So this toy has a spring and a mirror , so kids can
You see yourself in the mirror to _UNK_ it .
to look at the world in a different way .
Soon I attended a meeting in Turkey for the luxury of luxury .
And what &apos;s interesting is that I &apos;m the last _UNK_ ,
And a lot of people were really talking about luxury .
I don &apos;t want to be a _UNK_ in the party ,
But I felt that I had to make a speech _UNK_ .
And the fact that luxury is actually a luxury ,
For those who don &apos;t have too much luxury , luxury is relatively different .
And I &apos;ll give you two examples of this ,
And they all inspired the economics of economics .
This is in Cuba , this is a toy of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And this is a pair of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Now , the two brothers from Paul _UNK_
the _UNK_ of poverty and wisdom , and made a furniture ,
And this is the incredible thing in the market itself .
And the interesting thing is that as the progress of technology ,
And when we get more and more and more _UNK_ ,
You see , this furniture needs you to start using it .
Even though this chair , you need to open it up ,
And it &apos;s left you . This series of items are all _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ of the _UNK_ design of the _UNK_ .
His work _UNK_ from the _UNK_ hair to chocolate ,
to _UNK_ your love to _UNK_ your toes .
These designs are beautiful because they don &apos;t know why , it &apos;s a _UNK_ moment .
A lot of years ago , I heard a mathematician called _UNK_ ,
He explained the innovation of the military sector
is the secret innovation . And this is a _UNK_
_UNK_ innovation is like two opposite _UNK_ curve .
But in the _UNK_ society , like in the World War ,
You have to deal with the _UNK_ of steel
And when peace came , all of these techniques suddenly came
Many of you may have heard of Charles and Ray designed _UNK_ ,
And it &apos;s just one of these examples .
The glass fiber has suddenly been acquired by the civilian .
like our life has changed over the last 25 years .
So I &apos;m not sure how much the wavelength is .
but it &apos;s really a very important moment to design .
The computer technology is not only _UNK_ resources .
and it &apos;s possible to be in the _UNK_ ,
is not just sustainable about carbon emissions and development ,
It has become part of a lot of work now .
And that &apos;s why _UNK_ are more and more focused on the design of behavior ,
I want you to look at the work of _UNK_ ,
He was another young _UNK_ from France ,
He &apos;s now working with the pharmaceutical company ,
especially the _UNK_ can be determined to take medicine .
For example , this is a beautiful bottle of asthma ,
When you take the medicine , it will automatically _UNK_ .
so that the child will open the medicine bottle .
And the other drug is to make you work on it .
The transmission of the _UNK_ allows you to participate in
_UNK_ , like the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
There are many designs trying to make you participate , and make everything from your mouth .
So you can take the taste of something wrong .
The next one I &apos;m going to do is to show
about the relationship between design and science ,
I tried to find and not _UNK_ but agree .
_UNK_ : At present the common problem , the priority is urgent .
And I think this can make us more _UNK_ in design .
It makes design a _UNK_ , a direction rather than an instructions .
And I want you to respond to that .
I &apos;ve sent a mail to some of you .
We can show the glamour of two different ways .
It needs to start with a very small job ,
I have to point out that I think _UNK_ is trying
because I &apos;m going to go over and over and over again .
but I want to try to do something different .
and try to figure out my personal story ,
to get out of the subject that we &apos;ve talked about ,
Well , Africa is a very complex continent .
to tell a good story about the continent .
And this is what we normally say :
Some of you might think about it .
Let &apos;s focus on business and market , or something else .
And these are all the people who have _UNK_
And what I want to talk about is my story .
and a lot of Africans in this room
I &apos;m not going to grow in the _UNK_ or something tragic .
But I know that there &apos;s no money going to grow up
Look at the house without bankruptcy , and look at their breakfast .
We have eggs in good times when we are good .
because they &apos;re going to help their brothers , cousins and their parents
When I was born , they realized that they had a nice little kid
They don &apos;t want me to go to a nearby school ,
They &apos;re going to let me read a school that they can pay back
So they went to a private Catholic school
And that was the foundation of my career ,
You know , someone will come in with a form
You can only drop in school until you go to school ,
Why do they take me to read a cheap school
until now I understand why they did it .
In Kenya , we had a _UNK_ test in high school .
The National School is the best school ever .
I dreamed of school in Kenya in high school .
And I was so disappointed that I had
as if you don &apos;t know what to do ,
_UNK_ and _UNK_ are going to talk about it .
If you have empty room , maybe she &apos;ll let you go
because we &apos;re just poor because we don &apos;t have a privilege
because my father &apos;s name suggests that our identity is _UNK_ .
And I sat down and heard the _UNK_ telling my father
If you think you can get that empty room ,
If I had to work with those high _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s a very bad job to do it .
And I &apos;m never going to be able to
And they said , &quot; You can come . I &apos;m _UNK_ .
And the last thing is that the story
My father was suffering from AIDS in 1999 .
so that I was trying to figure out
And then I was in the United States
They called me to be sick , and this was the first time he got sick .
So I was looking for Google _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The doctor can &apos;t tell us what &apos;s going on .
They &apos;re like , you know , this is a long time ago .
And when I went to the Internet ,
But he needed to continue the treatment of drugs
At the time in the United States , _UNK_ ,
is used to treat fungi , to sell 30 dollars .
He can &apos;t rely on that pill to continue
At that time , he had a friend in India
His disease was _UNK_ again , on Friday ,
And there was only a bank in Kenya ,
But we don &apos;t have cash , and we don &apos;t have cash until Monday .
The hospital _UNK_ my father to the bottom .
We &apos;re still trying to send him to the state hospital .
And when we try to raise the money ,
Well , let &apos;s just imagine what &apos;s going on ,
This is what you know about all my things .
in a village that grew up in _UNK_
And you don &apos;t know the _UNK_ of _UNK_
I think Nike should hire him , &quot; _UNK_ to do it ! &quot;
And this is what I want to say .
In Africa , we should have more of our own stories .
If nobody tells us our story , then we can tell ourselves
And I want to go back and say ,
_UNK_ is a country in East Africa , a _UNK_ .
Four of them are white men , and _UNK_ are not _UNK_ .
And one is _UNK_ , if you &apos;re standing here ,
It &apos;s just not enough , we need to act .
It &apos;s just not enough to criticize it . It &apos;s not enough .
I resign from a top company in DC
And so high income can solve a lot of my home problems .
But I &apos;ve resigned , because my passion is here ,
because I wanted to achieve the personal ambition
and using the title of Harvard _UNK_ ,
And what we did is we recorded the records
My partner M , hi - tech expert , creates _UNK_ platform .
I &apos;m going to spend 20 dollars a month
and other labor workers are given for love .
We &apos;re building this project because we &apos;re getting bored .
I believe that the responsibility of the needs
We Africans need to challenge our leaders .
What if the leadership is that we don &apos;t like ?
So _UNK_ is a way that we think we can try
I &apos;d like to ask you to share everything here .
and keep these new ideas of thinking about it .
And one of the things I want to encourage you to do
I &apos;ve been talking about a lot about
People are like , if you don &apos;t have any help ,
I &apos;m a _UNK_ . How can I do that ?
And when I talk about my own ideas ,
and sometimes it &apos;s going to be a little bit
and you get a job or a businessman
It &apos;s sometimes important , especially in Africa ,
In fact , when I read the first year in the legal school ,
My mom &apos;s business was bankrupt , so I went to her .
I couldn &apos;t pay my cousin , and she was really smart .
My cousin died of AIDS , and his children became orphan .
So how do we deal with this ?
because the opportunity to give me the opportunity
because I could get to Harvard law ,
And I &apos;ve been in the last three years
It &apos;s not common in the United States ,
What do you want to do when you grow up
The United States doesn &apos;t have any _UNK_ of lawyers .
And he tried to give me the idea
But it &apos;s like , OK , although I don &apos;t know how to apply the law
Let &apos;s make it happen to me what you need to do .
What I need to do is to help you
Why are you going to go there ?
to some of the universities in Kenya ,
So I applied the law of _UNK_
And I &apos;m here because it &apos;s cheap to be here .
And he helped me , and encouraged me
He said I could go to Harvard
If Harvard doesn &apos;t allow me , they &apos;ll be wrong .
And what I need to get into the next stage is a power .
I &apos;m going to end up with the vision of Africa ,
This is what Americans think for granted .
is that life is not a very good environment ,
just because of the country in your village in Arkansas
For most African people , where you live , or where you &apos;re born .
as Africans , we need to be responsible for our Africa .
This is a company that I and my doctors and engineers --
This is listening to cows , but I don &apos;t know what it means .
In fact , in 2009 , it &apos;s better than it &apos;s now ,
I was trying to get a Ph.D. degree
how a system is going to _UNK_ high quality products .
I was at MIT a lab called _UNK_ City ,
and built this beautiful electric bicycle that was built .
I &apos;m glad I was a holiday at the time .
My friend _UNK_ , who was here at the time ,
because he was in a place in _UNK_
He told me I had just two human beings
And the situation that he mentioned was completely _UNK_
_UNK_ now -- is a engineer I know --
It &apos;s not going to be a fatal disease .
And it &apos;s known as the _UNK_ of _UNK_
And this was a completely _UNK_ me from the end .
I think there is a way to stop the _UNK_ .
My mom was a _UNK_ doctor --
And she told me that we usually test _UNK_ :
and then put it in a device called _UNK_ ,
This is a machine that &apos;s worth 10,000 dollars .
I guess most of the places in Europe
And the older sister of this thing , I mean , _UNK_ .
I like to fix all kinds of problems . I &apos;d like to make it happen .
I was a engineer , and I had three doctors
and there are 10 people because it &apos;s completely _UNK_ .
She &apos;s the center of the health care system .
We know that this thing must have these three functions .
then it &apos;s going to be used , it doesn &apos;t produce medical waste .
It &apos;s very simple enough to make _UNK_ work
The third is a portable , this nurse can put it in a tool ,
_UNK_ the oxygen content and pulse in my blood .
I put it on my finger , and I _UNK_ it .
Let me just explain it to you again .
You might have seen this little light in it .
There are three light here , three different wavelength light .
and then based on these light _UNK_ ,
the amount of scattering and the amount of _UNK_
And this is based on a project called
One of these things is made by a _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s going to be able to transmit these data .
We also do a lot of fun things .
I &apos;d like to talk to you about this .
And the map that I had behind me
I &apos;m going to sell these devices to every clinic in the world .
This map will be a new _UNK_ distribution map .
And the morning after the talk came to me ,
The first time I went out to see a friend
When I was in , she was on the table
What do I think this is a good idea ? &quot;
and you &apos;re going to be different from you .
That &apos;s what 600 people , 700 people are doing .
And she said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t seem to look like that . &quot;
And I said , &quot; You remember the age of college
And I said , &quot; Well , we remember that sometimes
And then we had to open up his room ,
So , of course , I can only say ,
&quot; _UNK_ , what are you doing ? What are you doing ?
How would you say this ? Do you get a head ?
&quot; You don &apos;t really want to break into the door .
And I said , &quot; I think the next little one . &quot;
And she said , &quot; You &apos;re the most _UNK_ example of the history . &quot;
And I looked at her and I said ,
And maybe the most difficult thing to do
I can &apos;t get my work to the public ,
And on the other hand , I was very hard .
But I want to talk about what I learned .
I &apos;ve learned two things in the last year ,
So if you put your hands in a very good way --
How many people think that fragile and weak is one thing ?
How many people , when you see this ? I &apos;m talking about fragile ,
I &apos;ve been studying this topic for 12 years --
I got a lot of invited from all over the country --
And a lot of the phones are like this :
And what do you want me to talk about ?
And these are the things that are coming from business ,
I &apos;m going to be very frank about you .
And because the TED talk became the focus --
About three months ago , when I was in a sports store ,
when parents buy something to their children ,
From about 100 feet , I heard a voice :
And I was so _UNK_ at this moment ,
I was at the teacher &apos;s meeting what was going on .
I thought , I should put a research on the _UNK_
I spent six years working on _UNK_
And I thought , &quot; Thank God , because it was a horrible topic .
It &apos;s the best way to get a _UNK_ on the plane .
You can only have the cards in your hand .
because it &apos;s not going to talk about race
because when they teach people how to sew them ,
They also taught people how to _UNK_ their own self ,
And here I have to write the name of this TED company .
And the first day I met the TED _UNK_ .
What do you think ? I did a _UNK_ . &quot;
So there was a round of applause , &quot; _UNK_ ! &quot;
Do you know what the biggest secret of TED is ?
And nobody on this stage , I know , is not failing .
There was a lot of help me last year .
Many people quote it for men in the _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s not the ones that sit down
to the people who are really _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ to the men in the game
And this is what it means to me .
And when you walk around the _UNK_ and put it on the door ,
You think , &quot; I &apos;m going to go in and I &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
You never get an MBA degree . Your wife left you .
I know you &apos;ve got an accident in your house .
I know you &apos;re not sure that you &apos;re not beautiful .
or not smart enough or not enough to be strong .
I know that even if you &apos;re a _UNK_ you never care about it . &quot;
And if we can calm down , we go into
We raised our head up and down
And then if you could cross this layer ,
What you need to understand is that shame is not guilty .
_UNK_ is focused on himself and focused on behavior .
And if you do some harm to me ,
would like to say , &quot; Sorry , I made a mistake ? &quot;
How many people would like to say that ?
And what we need to know is that
to do something that we &apos;ve done or something wrong .
And one of the things that _UNK_ need to know
And when I was in my mind and Chris ,
Everybody here knows what it &apos;s like to be .
We can be sure that the only person who is _UNK_
So I would argue that you have a little bit of _UNK_ .
I can take home _UNK_ and put it on the fire pan .
I don &apos;t know how much this ad sold ,
It has saved a lot of _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is not the expectations of a series of _UNK_ .
I did not interview men in the beginning of four years .
until one day in the book , a man looked at me and said ,
&quot; I appreciate your opinion about the _UNK_ ,
He said , &quot; Because you &apos;re going to go out ,
&quot; They prefer to see the death of my _UNK_
This is the coaches , who do this guy ,
because the women in my life were the worst of me . &quot;
And if you could find a woman like this , she could actually be with a woman
So I can give you an incredible woman .
And if you could find me a guy , he could be with a guy
and I can give you a real efficient man .
the way to work , to look at each other .
and very quickly share some of the _UNK_ from Boston .
He proposed a question : How did it be a standard woman ?
how many people in this country need to do
If we want to find a way to each other ,
And if you put the _UNK_ into the _UNK_ dish ,
the most powerful _UNK_ in the conflict :
I know that there &apos;s a _UNK_ outside the _UNK_ ,
because I thought I was doing it all my life ,
I &apos;m going to go in and play somebody &apos;s ass
And even though you &apos;ve been as perfect as possible ,
We want to be with you and to face with you .
Thank you very much . It &apos;s really very grateful .
We are a company that _UNK_ the automation ,
There are three _UNK_ sensors on the motor ,
If you let the wings go up and down ,
When you dive , it &apos;s pushing up enough area .
We have to make it _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
The lower side of the wing is _UNK_ .
from a passive _UNK_ force into active force , it &apos;s _UNK_ from efficiency .
_UNK_ : Well , it &apos;s better than we can fly again .
So let me share a lot of you .
to get people out of the _UNK_ experiment .
His goal and _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) signal of the health care system .
I think it &apos;s important that we should first be blind .
Woman : When I go to work , everyone said ,
What are we going to do with a blind woman ?
I can &apos;t see it , and I can &apos;t see my hair _UNK_ .
If a ant _UNK_ me in rice , I can &apos;t see it .
And the diagram is _UNK_ : it &apos;s invisible to it ,
But I think this is a life , and their dignity ,
She was just one of the thousands of blind men .
And the irony is that they can avoid blind .
A simple operation can make the _UNK_ light ,
Or simply , a pair of glasses can make more people see .
If you look at who of you in this room
because she put his glasses and made it more efficient ,
So one fifth of Indians will need vision ,
Now , we don &apos;t take care of their _UNK_ .
So this is what we did in the last 30 years
Now , we &apos;ve developed the _UNK_ of five hospitals ,
It &apos;s mainly based on _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
And then we added some , and we call the eye center ,
At the same time the rest of the world began to _UNK_ .
Most of them are poor and poor .
This is a day in _UNK_ , we &apos;re going to do about a thousand _UNK_ ,
and sent _UNK_ to the hospital and took the patient back ,
The most important thing is to do a lot of training ,
Many of them became a _UNK_ of the future staff including doctors .
that will continue to work like this every year .
It needs a lot of energy and _UNK_ work .
And I think that &apos;s going to happen , and thank you for this .
Dr. _UNK_ : I usually sit together with a ordinary country because I &apos;m from the country .
And all of a sudden you can interact with his heart ,
There seems to be a soul that has all confidence .
There &apos;s a old woman who has a great confidence to me that I must do her best .
we &apos;re going to define our world in this way ,
This helps us create a very moral and very _UNK_ institution
But in practice , you have to be able to do that ,
But it was amazing that inspired the McDonald &apos;s .
They think they can train people all over the world ,
Larry _UNK_ : He &apos;s been talking about McDonald &apos;s and _UNK_ ,
And then the _UNK_ let us know it .
Dr. _UNK_ : If I can provide vision ,
to make it work anywhere in the world ,
_UNK_ : If you think about it . I think the eye is the same ,
The problem is the same , the _UNK_ is also the same .
_UNK_ , the quality and service is a change of change ,
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on in the design system .
And of course , our challenge is that
a early innovation , and it &apos;s a _UNK_ to today .
is to create a ownership in a community ,
And then we did what we should do is to check their vision ,
and the doctor will find out where the problem is ,
and decided that there was a need to be further test ,
And then , all the results , doctors will make the final diagnosis ,
If they need a pair of glasses , they can get it in the camp ,
but they can choose the frame for themselves ,
But at the same time , they would like to pay for the payment .
If you don &apos;t have such transportation and support ,
a lot of people like this don &apos;t get that kind of service ,
And then they would have two days in the house ,
And then they &apos;re going to go to the bus
and then they came back to the place ,
there would be their family waiting for them .
Maybe we could play a lot of patients to be amazing ,
But what we &apos;re looking at is , are we dealing with this ?
We found that we had about 7 percent of the need
So we &apos;re building it as a primary visual health centre and eye centre .
We made a simple digital camera into a retina camera ,
and every patient would do a remote advisory with a doctor .
The efficiency of the first year is that
We have 40 percent of our service population
And then the next year is 75 percent .
I think we &apos;ve got one of these things
and then use technology in this process to guarantee
Most people don &apos;t have to go to the hospital .
The patient also _UNK_ the cost of bus to the city ,
They only pay 20 Indian _UNK_ , which can pay three _UNK_ .
And the other challenge is , how do we get high-tech
that can send the patient to the hospital
And in the patient , the report will be sent to patients in time ,
and then get what they &apos;re going to do ,
In the past , the patient went to see a doctor who had to spend half a year
So one of the fundamental factors of the market growth ,
On the other hand , the eye specialist in the hospital
So what this video shows is a surgical operation ,
The table is good for the distance from the table ,
And we have to do that , because of that ,
we have the ability to do the work .
And what we employ is the country girl ,
They brought the lung power to the whole organization .
They are doing almost all the major _UNK_ of technology .
They were _UNK_ . They had done a great job .
So , in conclusion , the fact is that
When we make sure that the quality of the quality , we have to
is much lower than the _UNK_ of London ,
This is the number that you see very little .
And what we do is that many are free ,
For those who have the ability to pay , we charge local market prices .
I think this is our _UNK_ until now .
And of course , one must have a chance
because we need free treatment for a lot of patients
_UNK_ dollars , more than _UNK_ in the tax sector .
But that means that we &apos;re going to go beyond what we &apos;re doing now ,
If you really want to solve problems that are blind .
So we did some _UNK_ things that we did .
Many are in our own _UNK_ , and there are other parts of the world .
And it turns out that the result is that
And we couldn &apos;t talk about it later ,
you can accept the price of the lens ,
So , after a while , we have the ability to reduce the spending .
to the point of two percentage points that we &apos;re starting .
Now , we believe that we have a global market ,
In short , what I &apos;m going to suggest is that we &apos;re going to move this pattern
In order to explain this , we compare British eye treatment and _UNK_ .
And this shows that what we do is the U.K.
The quality of training and patient care is the same level .
because it was not successful in Britain , but India was successful .
I mean , I want to look at other ways .
And the way to reduce cost is to produce efficiency ,
or in the lens that they can pay for more expensive glasses ,
Another idea is that I want to leave you ,
You can use dental _UNK_ , hearing aid , _UNK_ , etc .
There &apos;s a lot of this paradigm that can do ,
But the most important thing I want to do
Now how do you get people to have problems ,
I &apos;m sure there will be someone in this room to find the answer .
So I think I &apos;ll end with this problem and challenge .
you think the world is full of these things .
in the digital world , the digital world ,
It &apos;s going to be _UNK_ in the future .
And for humans , they &apos;re going to be _UNK_
It is sweet and sour , and it is full of _UNK_ .
So my question is how to make virtual things .
If we look at the _UNK_ of the iPhone ,
Now , I want to show you three possibilities .
to feel the weight of the object in the hand .
And there &apos;s a piece of _UNK_ in it .
And when you move the digital map , you know ,
and the center is going to move around .
like , &quot; Okay , turn it right . Here &apos;s the left side . &quot;
And the good thing is that you can look at the _UNK_ ,
and no longer focused on the screen .
The shape of the object in our competitors will be specific .
If I download a book , only 20 pages thick ,
If that book has 500 pages , I would like to feel
For example , in your pocket , it &apos;s going to be very thin ,
When you get your hand , you want it to be on you , it &apos;s got a little bit thick .
If you change your posture , it will also be _UNK_ .
And this becomes the _UNK_ shape , the _UNK_ ,
like the screen that you need to use ,
to tell you , &quot; Okay , there &apos;s something there .
because you feel that the corner is slightly thick .
Can we make cell phones have feelings ?
What we don &apos;t do , we can feel if it &apos;s safe .
But the cell has its breath and heart ,
This is a very _UNK_ , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for .
and it makes people more and more and more
And when I was a little boy , I promised
as an American , to protect and be loyal .
It includes air , soil , mineral resources , forest , _UNK_ and wildlife .
In 1968 I founded the Earth _UNK_ for a while .
And when the Brown Administration , I and some friends
And even though our economy improves the _UNK_ .
But we have less greenhouse gases than any other states .
In reducing greenhouse gases , California is basically equivalent to Europe .
This year , the Earth _UNK_ has a supplement , and I &apos;m going to
And the interesting thing is that in a very large way ,
The biggest cities are all in the developing world
They developed three times faster than the developed country .
When we look at history , they are the _UNK_ of history .
what the world looked like before the _UNK_ .
Now , we have a city development distributed
The villages around the world are getting lost .
I had a romantic view of the village ,
There &apos;s a cash deal that people don &apos;t want to go back
to those places , you find a lot of beautiful scenes
They are poor , but they are highly _UNK_ and they have very creative .
One billion people are building their cities ,
They begin to _UNK_ , with the time , they have great progress .
cable television , water , the whole range , all _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s not true that the _UNK_ is _UNK_ prosperity .
In _UNK_ , half of the city &apos;s _UNK_ ,
The social capital is a highly _UNK_ and most _UNK_ .
to talk about that , a lot of people think about
&quot; Oh , that &apos;s terrible . We have to solve their housing problems . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , we have to make them have a phone service . &quot;
Now , they showed us how they did the telephone service .
so that you can solve the same problem .
You go to a _UNK_ _UNK_ like _UNK_ .
you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
It &apos;s much better than a mall . It &apos;s much larger .
The key is that people are not _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ economy , it &apos;s like dark energy in the body .
It &apos;s not supposed to be , but it &apos;s a big one .
We don &apos;t know how it works . But we must understand it .
In the past , there may be a crime . Or add to crime .
to make them easier to go into the _UNK_ society .
Because if we don &apos;t do that , they &apos;re going to be a criminal .
and also provide services for the entire city .
One of the major activities is that these _UNK_ schools .
parents compiled money to hire some local teachers
In cities , education is more likely , and change the world .
And this is the value of the city ,
like , on the left side of this city , there is a living life .
the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ and the guards
We are studying this dense neighborhood of _UNK_ .
because there &apos;s a lot of interesting ways in the city .
It can make the cities of the developing world become more green .
because people have to get rid of poverty , a _UNK_ agricultural catastrophe
And those people who stay in the country could sell money .
to bring food to the emerging cities market .
So if you want to keep a village , you have a good road ,
or a good cell phone signal . It &apos;s better with some electric power .
We all live in the Earth . This is going to change .
These numbers are pretty big . Now , a billion people live in cities .
This is more than six people live in their way .
And it &apos;s going to be a big one .
Perhaps the most _UNK_ thing in the city is that cities have _UNK_ .
They don &apos;t even get rich . They &apos;re going to live in cities .
that means that the _UNK_ is going to be
when we get more and more old people and me ,
In northern hemisphere , some old people and old cities
And in the emerging cities of the developing world , young people are innovation ,
What do you think that these changes are going to happen ?
I &apos;m sorry that the weather is worse than we think ,
we &apos;re going to be surprised . Almost all of the things
And what &apos;s going on is the war of resources
to support the people . And then people have trouble .
The power of the _UNK_ is to make a city
And so far , only three kinds of electricity resources ,
No one will continue to use coal burning _UNK_ .
wind and solar power help , because we don &apos;t have to store these energy .
Or nuclear power , this is the low _UNK_ ,
If we could eventually be able to use solar energy ,
Remember , this can accelerate the country and cities of the developing world
And if you &apos;ve been using nuclear power ,
and the number of waste is added up .
A common , _UNK_ coal power , burning 80 coal every day .
So , when you look at these different kinds of sources ,
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . There &apos;s water and wind and wind , wind up solar .
but the miners who feel the threat of nuclear power .
is busy building and start building the nuclear reactor .
That &apos;s what environmental people like to call the _UNK_ reactor .
I &apos;m not sure that local solar power and wind power
But frankly , we &apos;re starting to have a little reactor
In northern Russia , there was a new channel
The Russian are starting to build the _UNK_ reactor
Here is the design of early electronics .
with the standard of _UNK_ or _UNK_ _UNK_ .
These are small , and they &apos;re very easy to install .
And almost all of these are small and can avoid nuclear diffusion .
So I think it &apos;s going to be important in the future .
This is 10 percent of the room in this room .
Half of them were _UNK_ from the Russian _UNK_ .
I want to see the Bush administration &apos;s positive promotion .
The global nuclear energy cooperative plan is going to continue
And I &apos;m glad to see the Obama President
They are helpful to the environment because they have _UNK_ farming
to reduce carbon dioxide from the soil ,
and it &apos;s going to increase the production of production .
In the end , biological technology is developing rapidly in Africa .
But I know a couple of weeks ago , American national defence department was also given a chance
in fact , it &apos;s going to be more terrible .
We might say , &quot; Okay , what can we do ? &quot;
Who &apos;s the engineer ? What do they do ? Where are they doing ?
It &apos;s like the war between the two countries .
I want to say that this is more realistic than people think .
The _UNK_ is very focused on the following example .
The second year in 1992 , a lot of ice
to give the polar bear a high yield ,
It will cost a billion dollars a year .
This is not what it means to be .
The plan is to find out the water
This will affect the _UNK_ of the Earth .
In many small places , there &apos;s a lot of different ways
The first thing about the _UNK_ _UNK_ is :
&quot; We &apos;re like God , we might be able to do something like God . &quot;
&quot; We are God , we must do the role . &quot;
I stayed at the sea for a week with a study of a ship .
In the Gulf of Mexico , the team was working in
By the way , this is the boat that we put in .
It &apos;s not the effect of oil and _UNK_ on _UNK_ --
And these things are eaten by little things .
to follow the oil and the science of _UNK_
So , the opposite that we heard a few months ago
and it &apos;s going to affect the food chain .
Now we &apos;re not going to feel strange about this .
is just to kill small things , insects ,
what was going to take me to the Gulf ,
What I don &apos;t think is that we &apos;ve reached a consensus
It means that every 24 hours of the day
trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in finance --
You know , you know , all the _UNK_ of the game :
about &quot; If the government &apos;s climate change committee ( IPCC )
by the _UNK_ physicist at _UNK_ --
It &apos;s not going to be the public , it &apos;s harmful ,
It should be taken by the _UNK_ industry .
If there &apos;s a policy like this --
&quot; Before we start to really reduce emissions ,
&quot; How much we can make this planet go ,
to increase two degrees , three degrees , or --
It &apos;s not hot this week , it &apos;s not too cold ,
the temperature is right -- the style for living --
It &apos;s a common explanation , and there &apos;s a lot of evidence to it .
For example , if you &apos;re a 35 year-old banker ,
And you don &apos;t have a lot of choices .
You can solve the problem -- you &apos;re _UNK_ --
is the kind of genius in the world .
These options -- genius and _UNK_ --
By the way , Tony _UNK_ , the CEO of the American oil company ,
I bet some of you have this written written .
because -- maybe this is not a particular painting --
But I &apos;d like to think about it forever .
And the question -- the danger of privilege --
because none of us -- at least in the northern hemisphere --
and you think that these stories disappear in history ,
I showed this ad not to accuse of _UNK_ --
But we are not only _UNK_ about the natural fairy tales .
that we would never be able to _UNK_ her .
&quot; The Gulf is a very large sea .
We put in the amount of oil and _UNK_
that are very tiny to the total amount of water . &quot;
_UNK_ us with a _UNK_ of technology .
But we found ourselves in a sort of narrative _UNK_ .
We &apos;re not only talking about the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a _UNK_ message that makes it crazy .
We often hear that we continue to stay in the past ,
So that means that in the deepest water ,
It &apos;s worth taking some time to understand the mining process ,
It &apos;s not just a drill that can _UNK_ it out .
First of all , we should remove the trees .
and the wastewater is _UNK_ into the large toxic _UNK_ .
It &apos;s hard to understand the scale of the work ,
and expand the size of the United States .
the fastest _UNK_ truck in the world ,
Now , I should admit that in my opinion ,
When we know that we need to learn
The black hole in the middle of my country --
We can only stand on a long watch .
And at the end of the day , we &apos;re going to be saved ,
And this is called the _UNK_ of the Earth .
We should launch the sulfate and aluminum particles
The _UNK_ plan is -- it &apos;s not my _UNK_ --
It &apos;s a lot more pollution to solve the problem of pollution .
which is going to produce a terrible side effect .
After all , we don &apos;t need to change our lifestyle .
They were wearing a _UNK_ _UNK_ in their _UNK_ .
For some other people , they _UNK_ their hands with rubber hose .
We need all kinds of hero stories ,
For example , hundreds of young people are _UNK_
Dan _UNK_ : Please bring the _UNK_ to us . Let &apos;s start .
_UNK_ : There are lots of advanced chairs here .
And when I got to the top , I thought , these are the _UNK_
_UNK_ : Obviously , these are not our usual performance .
This is what we don &apos;t have to learn .
We &apos;re going to try it . Can we give some _UNK_ music ?
_UNK_ : It &apos;s a great show . It &apos;s great . You &apos;re amazing .
_UNK_ : When people do these , they will fall down .
is that this extra effort has led us to today .
Right , look at this , and there are some different kinds of _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , TED is about innovation . _UNK_ : Yes .
_UNK_ : Michael _UNK_ showed some of the _UNK_ _UNK_
Now , Dan is going to show us something he invented .
_UNK_ : This is a little bit of a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : You know , this is the _UNK_ , not to make everyone quiet .
Let me try and try , I &apos;ll get six glasses .
In order to perform six glasses , I have to control good .
Now there &apos;s six cups , and I &apos;ll give you a _UNK_
I tried to figure out what to do first ?
_UNK_ : Well , it &apos;s a good idea to get that _UNK_
_UNK_ : Okay , he did that , OK .
_UNK_ : You know , you know , _UNK_ , every year ,
the things that are stimulated are our practices .
And Richard . We used to play a whip
And in our show , you can see , it &apos;s fun , _UNK_ is Daniel _UNK_
_UNK_ : Sorry , can we do the _UNK_ design ?
_UNK_ : Well , how do we find Richard participation in this program
What he did was actually more dangerous than this .
_UNK_ : Jesus . Richard , asked me to go ahead of me
_UNK_ : Every year I &apos;ve been playing with them .
This is -- I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s true .
_UNK_ : Okay , let &apos;s stand here --
God , I hate that . Put your hand in this way , thank you .
usually Dan &apos;s going to take a balloon , but now you have to protect him .
It was a great time to come to Richard ,
and let him hold your wrist , so I can do it .
_UNK_ : Please hold my wrist for a while .
_UNK_ : These years of phones came up , Richard . ( _UNK_ : before ) : and before he did .
_UNK_ : So Richard , are we on the list ?
_UNK_ : Don &apos;t hold me in a _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ : We &apos;ve done a time ago
_UNK_ : Yeah , you don &apos;t want to catch up , believe me
_UNK_ : Can you separate your legs apart ?
_UNK_ : _UNK_ , do you want to do that ?
And again , my _UNK_ , I don &apos;t think they &apos;re _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : It &apos;s cool . I &apos;ve been trying to figure out the show
Now , we risk Richard &apos;s life danger , only our risk is fair .
So , to do this , I &apos;m going to use these three sharp _UNK_ .
If this is not sharp , your response is the same .
_UNK_ : Wow , I hope it will be more _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ in the air . In that _UNK_ , the blood pool .
_UNK_ : Okay , we start this stunt , but remember ,
_UNK_ : What are you going to see in ten years ?
_UNK_ : Well , it &apos;s not so hard that we just practice too long .
In fact , we will prove that they may be false --
-- they may be fake -- they &apos;re all sharp .
_UNK_ : One could throw a small animal out of the farm
just try to get the possibility . Okay , we start .
_UNK_ : What do you feel , _UNK_ , do you feel good ?
_UNK_ : Do you feel all right ? That &apos;s the one --
_UNK_ : This is a little bit , who &apos;s responsible for the light ? You can .
And I can see a little bit of it .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ intensity , we still have pink in the middle .
_UNK_ : Well , _UNK_ . That &apos;s too much about vision .
the body &apos;s design -- it &apos;s completely different .
_UNK_ : I &apos;m sorry to say that I &apos;m sorry .
_UNK_ : I think my part is not hard .
to jump up , jump up , and jump .
_UNK_ , no one dance . Only we are here .
_UNK_ : Well , _UNK_ : there &apos;s another one .
_UNK_ : Well , some of our experiences you might know .
No matter whether you believe it or not , you can win the world &apos;s _UNK_ .
I know what you &apos;re thinking , the other _UNK_ must be _UNK_ .
But there &apos;s a _UNK_ next to my feet ,
You want me to do what I want .
Richard , you tell him . This is your last year .
Well , a good opportunity to do that .
I &apos;m going to use a _UNK_ response to me .
The _UNK_ _UNK_ the _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
I met , _UNK_ . This is enough .
Is it going to affect half the stage . Yes , too bizarre .
Look , I &apos;ll move seven _UNK_ to my feet .
You are my hero , you are my little Jim .
From my foot , I will be seven _UNK_ _UNK_ .
waiting for your next word ? What is it going to be ?
OK . You sometimes have to close the television .
from my foot , the seven _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
from six to seven . _UNK_ : This is a world record .
Please , be quiet . Be quiet . Thank you .
I &apos;ve put nine tons of CO2 in the air .
When I came home , do I want to commit suicide ?
What I &apos;m going to do is another way to _UNK_ carbon dioxide ,
We know that the coral is very sensitive to temperature ,
They are also vital to the diversity of the oceans .
If I was 15 years ago , I couldn &apos;t take this picture .
There is a new channel of _UNK_ and Pacific _UNK_ .
This is the _UNK_ of _UNK_ , and its _UNK_ has disappeared .
The glaciers are also important for life on earth .
In _UNK_ , the main resource of the sea will disappear .
In Africa , corn is one of the major foods in many places .
are used to feed animals or make _UNK_ oil .
Every year , it will reduce the area of 50,000 _UNK_ .
Today , there are _UNK_ refugees in the world .
We have already shown pictures in 100 cities .
and obviously I &apos;m going to do another project .
The first man : What &apos;s the best thing in my life ?
And that &apos;s when my father told me , &quot; Come , I &apos;ll give the girl your bride . &quot;
First woman : Love ? Love is the best thing I can have .
The second man : _UNK_ and _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
This is love ! ( third male : my biggest fear is --
Four men : Because I finished what I wanted to do , I thought I was happy .
_UNK_ : We invented stories , we can fly around the world , but we can stay in the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : You know , family . It &apos;s awful .
A man : In life , your life is the only one .
_UNK_ : Who am I ? This is the first big question ?
_UNK_ : If I could go back to Iraq ,
I have to _UNK_ down and kissed their _UNK_ request .
as I had to take away a child in Iraq ,
You don &apos;t worry about me . Dad don &apos;t have to work anymore .
I just wanted to show myself . Let myself win more profits ,
Let parents try to get to a very wealthy feeling .
Don &apos;t want them to enjoy the lives of a very poor life .
If I was really wealthy , I &apos;d like to thank my parents , I would like to say to them .
And thank you for the _UNK_ of my life ,
to let me have today . Thank you . &quot;
_UNK_ : I &apos;ve spent seven years in the _UNK_ ,
but it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ to me
Many people say I can &apos;t surfing . And I went to the _UNK_ world , and I used to dive .
I think this is all closely connected to nature ,
because we have some kind of _UNK_ on the planet .
_UNK_ : For example , you all love each other .
If I really like you . I &apos;ll give you a cow and a lot of other things ,
Now I &apos;m going to talk about my film .
It &apos;s also a wonderful story about life expedition .
Video : The Earth has the history of _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s not like we &apos;re _UNK_ millions of other species .
And I had the privilege of looking at it
Our lives depend on the well-being of our planet .
We all share the gift of the Earth .
is to protect the natural product of our planet .
In order to better future , we all have the ability
_UNK_ : This is the producer of the film .
The key to my clinical research is always a bone transplant .
but it brings a bone marrow to the marrow .
to save hundreds of thousands of people .
Most of them have the advanced _UNK_ of leukemia and _UNK_ .
A few years ago I was _UNK_ at Stanford .
In the operating room , I gave Bob a surgical operation .
To save a child with leukemia , we &apos;re going to _UNK_ America
So , how do we get a bone marrow now ?
Oh , we have a professional operating team , a nurse ,
Bob &apos;s on the stage , and we use this little _UNK_ ,
And what we do is we usually do ,
in the middle of a hole in the _UNK_ ,
to the _UNK_ -- this is a medical term --
It &apos;s about 10 _UNK_ out of the bone ,
I handed the nurse and she collected the bone to a _UNK_ .
And then I handed it back to me . We did that again .
After the end of my arms , my hand had been _UNK_ .
You know , this approach has not changed for 40 years .
there may be a better way to pick up .
This new invention is a bone - marrow _UNK_ .
It &apos;s the following principle of working on it .
_UNK_ only once , enter the front and rear of the _UNK_ .
and with a special metal ring , it can go into the bone marrow ,
and move the _UNK_ along the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ a lot of bone marrow and bone marrow .
You can do the same thing as a different route .
So quickly , Bob needed a medical _UNK_ , local anesthesia ,
I got a little _UNK_ at Stanford and made some models .
Later , we tested two large animals , and the application of pig .
We were surprised to find that instead of _UNK_ ,
and you get 10 times the living body
to do the stem cells in the cell .
The American Food and _UNK_ Administration had just approved the invention .
You can see the _UNK_ of this patient , and the _UNK_ _UNK_ along the line .
It &apos;s from the same _UNK_ , the same patient , two _UNK_ .
The patient needs only a local anesthesia and no longer _UNK_ .
We collected three times from the same patient than normal methods .
to do the stem cells in the cell .
So why do you care ? Because bone marrow is a very rich source of cells .
They have a big potential , but they don &apos;t have access to clinical trial .
including the blood stem cells in the bone .
It &apos;s always been used to do stem cells .
in the last 10 years , a lot of _UNK_
_UNK_ stem cells to treat other diseases of patients .
I hope this invention is to collect more stem cells .
to encourage more people to apply for it .
You have your own bone marrow stem cells ,
Once you need it , you can always use it .
And finally , I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
We &apos;re going to meet us every year at Stanford .
The women have two big X chromosomes .
And of course , there &apos;s a little Y ,
_UNK_ , I &apos;m sorry , that little thing makes you different .
And what you see is that this double spiral structure
The code of life is composed of these _UNK_ .
How many structures do we have in the human genome ?
But if I put a base on it ,
This is the _UNK_ pixels on a _UNK_ screen .
You &apos;ve got to watch a human genome
a group of people -- it &apos;s got a Y chromosome .
For 15 years , it took about _UNK_ million dollars
And in 2003 , they went on to perfect it .
These are all done by a machine like this .
It costs about one dollar per base
What I &apos;m doing now is to get a genome
And then you put it into 50 base _UNK_ ,
and _UNK_ it to you and read it .
And to make you more intuitive to understand
This summer will be promoted to 600 ,
And so the price of each base sequence
It &apos;s like you get a car in 1998 .
_UNK_ Jupiter had two and a half billion
the old sequence , and then these new things .
you don &apos;t always see the trends rise like that .
It &apos;s about 50,000 to 100,000 human genome this year .
This is based on the _UNK_ of the machine .
And it &apos;s going to be possible in the future .
The Chinese have no doubt on the race of the new moon .
And she had a _UNK_ positive breast cancer .
Two years later , she found that she was _UNK_ .
And three years later she was 42 years old ,
and the heart failure was eight days later .
First of all , she took 10 years of treatment
because someone , like my colleagues , Rick _UNK_ ,
and decided to make a difference between her _UNK_
He _UNK_ , and he took skin cells , healthy skin skin .
He measured all the genome of the two .
He compared the software to two groups of genome ,
If this gene happens to be harmful to mutation ,
there are 90 percent of the possibility that
but it was for her family to her
They take the gene test and understand the situation .
they can take a regular examination and find out the disease early .
Let me show you a little bit about _UNK_
They were diagnosed as a _UNK_ when they were two years old .
She doesn &apos;t believe that the diagnosis is in conformity with the symptom .
and through her _UNK_ efforts and online search ,
The gentleman in the photograph called Joe _UNK_ ?
So he measured the genes of his children .
They found a series of mutations on the gene .
This clip is related to the function of _UNK_ .
So , besides _UNK_ , they treated _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
You know , there &apos;s no genome sequence that can &apos;t be done .
And it took about 100,000 dollars a few years ago ,
And the next year is a hundred years
_UNK_ went to the hospital and had a treatment
but when he ate , his _UNK_ open .
and I pray , I &apos;m really miserable . &quot;
His _UNK_ doctor was just in the background of clinical genetics .
He said , &quot; Let &apos;s sequence him with a genome . &quot;
and found that a single bit of mutations
And so the reason is that he &apos;s right
This is a natural reaction that leads to _UNK_ cells .
But the _UNK_ of this gene is going to happen .
So the question is that it &apos;s going to be
He took the treatment of the bone tissue
means that we can live 10 to 20 years
And of course , there &apos;s a global footprint .
And as the population continues to grow up ,
we &apos;re going to have to use GM products .
And this is the only side of my hand .
In fact , the typewriter was completely replaced by this
and then it &apos;s a lot of different _UNK_ .
But the most amazing thing is that
And suddenly we have _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
This is the age of genetic revolution , and we are in the age of the time .
but the genes that are connected to the planet
And what does that mean to me ?
I &apos;ve just bought the people &apos;s Insurance recently .
A : I never did a gene test , B . I couldn &apos;t get any chance .
C . I &apos;m not going to say that .
If my insurance agent is listening to me , I &apos;m really not lying .
What if I choose is the C ?
You don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s going to happen
not to sequence the genes on your iPhone ? There &apos;s a application .
to sequence the _UNK_ sequence on the _UNK_ gene .
Who &apos;s here today that &apos;s the other half of you
And as long as it passed , or she _UNK_ her mouth .
And you know , in the lab , you know ,
She has been able to report the tax report
And then she asked other competitors to do that .
Do you think this will be John _UNK_ ?
Like my same name , do you raise your hand ?
My father was a species of 10 brothers .
They moved to the corners of the world .
I have a relationship with my _UNK_ , but I &apos;m not sure .
Imagine if my genome was decided to save in the software ,
The genome of a three brothers is also true .
There are software that can be compared to two samples .
It &apos;s not hard to imagine that my company has this software .
If the software can agree to both sides ,
&quot; Do you want to meet your three cousins ? &quot;
How many father in this room ? Please raise your hands .
OK , experts think that one percent of you are in the middle
They don &apos;t represent the quality of our relationships .
or the nature of our society -- at least not yet ,
whether it &apos;s good for the human being ,
And so I really want you to wake up
and participate in the gene revolution around you .
In the next 18 minutes I can do my best .
And if you don &apos;t have any equation , you can see the physics of particles .
and people find that there &apos;s a lot of things
Every coral is made up of thousands of separate _UNK_ .
Imagine these coral reefs that there are _UNK_ intelligence
we can grab one of them to ask him a simple question .
Why do you happen to be in this position ?
-- this is the fate of an accident or other factors ?
And after the global warming warning to us ,
And he said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s silly to ask this question .
You know that this coral is sometimes not really _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a neighbor that &apos;s exactly the same _UNK_ .
It &apos;s going to be a whole thing with other coral reefs .
and we have different _UNK_ that we have .
It tells us that the world is the same .
It &apos;s hard to understand the problem of this .
because every one can live through a life .
In this experiment , _UNK_ was sitting in a box of _UNK_ material .
There are two possible conditions on quantum mechanics .
that may decay or not be _UNK_ .
will lead a chain of reaction to release gas .
but in another way he would live .
Another possibility is that it doesn &apos;t exist for him .
And it looks very strange because we are
We are like _UNK_ , like those of you
This is the rule of the small world .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about this :
And the other direction of physics is to describe what can happen .
And the physics tells us that everything can be used in geometry
Now I &apos;m going to talk about the understanding of these particles
In this device , the _UNK_ and the _UNK_
And then you get a huge amount of energy
the sensor and the computer will analyze their properties .
the amount of energy in the process is equivalent to
we can &apos;t predict what particles are going to be
But the physics tells us what particles might be
the quality and the energy of these particles
and the conservation of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_
And the reason why this new _UNK_ is that
and it &apos;s going to reach the power limit .
So we &apos;re going to see a new particle
I first introduced the particles that have known .
There &apos;s a lot of work in this room
There is a _UNK_ partner called _UNK_ ,
The quality of the quality is very small .
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ quality are big .
and I &apos;ll be able to get them together .
These particles are divided into two kinds of _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
The second generation and the third generation are the same generation .
and the particles are going to work on each other .
And there &apos;s a very faint force called _UNK_ .
And the three _UNK_ of the _UNK_
And this is the wrong thing to do .
And finally , gravity is rotating through the quality and rotating .
every one of these things is going to be
and what happens is that it &apos;s going to happen
There &apos;s a kind of particle that we &apos;ve never seen ,
called _UNK_ particles that make all particles have quality .
is that _UNK_ particles are sure to do that .
But the biggest secret is what we can see .
I &apos;m going to show you the final presentation
Now if we use different _UNK_ and load
There &apos;s a possibility that there are _UNK_ particles
and it was a big number of people
But if we draw them out on their own load ,
by two _UNK_ and one of the next _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ has a _UNK_ of _UNK_
The particles also have the opposite of the _UNK_ .
And we found that the charge was actually
If we separate the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ ,
The load of particles on the surface of this _UNK_ load .
Because of the particles we only know the charge .
but you don &apos;t know how _UNK_ and _UNK_
The _UNK_ particles on the left are huge .
Because a lot of _UNK_ particles are distributed
The _UNK_ of the electromagnetic force is still not in quality .
and the load space _UNK_ the charge .
by using the load of the particles ,
We can put the force in the direction of two _UNK_ .
And in the middle of the two directions ,
all the load of the particles can be used
a _UNK_ space that allows us to look at
whether particles work naturally on these four forces ,
a particle that could generate energy if it collide with its _UNK_ .
the load of four charge lines in the direction .
so that if you keep the same energy and load ,
that can produce any kind of material ,
For example , this _UNK_ and its _UNK_
a _UNK_ can _UNK_ into an electron .
And these three _UNK_ are still zero .
So these _UNK_ are not only beautiful .
and tell us what the interaction is to be in conformity with the rules .
If you rotate the load space in the _UNK_ space ,
can look at the effects of the _UNK_
In _UNK_ , for example , this is the _UNK_
will be the same as the green _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to take a different _UNK_ like this red _UNK_ .
If you take them all in a conference in the _UNK_ space ,
And the pattern that we know is that
The particles in the small world are made
And some of the particles in the world
In the experiment , the _UNK_ saw the _UNK_
From this pattern , we understand the particle of the micro world
The universe is running in this tiny world .
And I want to talk about the unknown areas .
We &apos;re going to expand this pattern of math .
and see if you can &apos;t look at the _UNK_ ,
We want to find out the universe ,
and then you get more energy to experiment ,
And the load pattern of the load is
that comes from a more perfect pattern .
with the _UNK_ particles that split the pattern
So we &apos;re going to import a new load
When we import a new direction , we &apos;re going to wonder
And then we can rotate it with other particles .
If we can put it in a _UNK_ space ,
The _UNK_ of the seven - dimensional space design
This particle choice is proposed by _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
and found that there were particles that were empty .
This is a bigger structure that allows us to predict
The unified model _UNK_ that the two _UNK_
and they should be very similar to the _UNK_ .
And now you can rotate this little _UNK_
and think about the strange phenomenon of particles :
The second generation and the third generation of material
These particles can &apos;t be identified by six _UNK_ .
They would stack each other in the standard space .
We can give the only new load of each particle .
Here we can see the second generation and the third generation
through a _UNK_ and the first generation of _UNK_
And this particular load pattern in the _UNK_
One of the most beautiful geometric structures in mathematics
This is the biggest exception of the _UNK_ pattern .
The _UNK_ is a kind of smooth _UNK_ space .
every single point of the pattern can be this incredibly complicated and beautiful .
A small part of the _UNK_ can be described
And Einstein explained the gravity in a broad sense
The geometry and the quantum mechanics are together .
And the pattern that &apos;s in the _UNK_ space
and then you can see a lot of it .
And we can rotate the space of the _UNK_
It &apos;s a very beautiful structure and other _UNK_ theory .
We can see some space in this pattern
There are 20 spaces that need new particles to fill .
Two of them have been filled with _UNK_ and _UNK_ particles .
From the pattern we know these new particles and _UNK_
but they have _UNK_ and strong interactions ,
And it was thought that many people in _UNK_
There is a prediction that this has a big mathematical structure .
that we can imagine the minimum size of the planet
And this math describes the theory of nature .
&quot; Nature has always shown us in front of us
It &apos;s composed of _UNK_ and other geometric shapes .
There &apos;s no way we &apos;re going to get lost in the dark Maze . &quot;
And I believe that this is really true .
When I was studying these things with other physicists ,
But the core of the math is that
and the particles are going to work on each other .
with a new kind of machine like a big _UNK_ .
And the pattern is going to come up and see
The _UNK_ pattern is also the nature of nature .
And this is a wonderful expedition to explore
If the particle is found in accordance with the _UNK_ pattern ,
If the particle finds a new particle , it doesn &apos;t fit the pattern .
It &apos;s going to be very interesting , very _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s always going to take a lot of risks .
This theory and other types of theories are all _UNK_ .
And even though it took a lot of work
It looks like the new physics theory of _UNK_
and it &apos;s going to be a big investment
and it &apos;s always hard to make it difficult .
But in science , if you don &apos;t use it ,
And in this case , you don &apos;t know ,
the only way to keep sense and get happiness
I &apos;ve been trying to keep my life balance .
I tried to find a balance in physics and _UNK_ .
And even though my physical research didn &apos;t work .
I spent most of my time in the last 10 years
Now the big puzzle of my parents is ,
How do I have a full - time job ?
And I &apos;m going to tell you that the secret
This is a picture of my family office on _UNK_ Island .
And you might notice that these pictures are
because it was my home and office in _UNK_
I don &apos;t worry about spending my time on the rent .
It &apos;s always a difficult way to live in a _UNK_ way .
And so I can live in a beautiful place
to keep my life that I love .
And I could spend a lot of time
And I was also willing to deal with _UNK_
I &apos;m glad to be invited to speak here .
I think I only know the _UNK_ part ,
But I absolutely liked it . So I wanted to make it ugly .
Well , it makes people feel excited about it .
And if you &apos;re right , if you &apos;re right ,
So you &apos;re not saying that we should understand
the ones in the universe that are most tiny .
I mean , you don &apos;t have the smallest size ,
Well , just to show you the pattern
is the fundamental particle physics that we know ,
And that &apos;s where I say that we are certain .
And the shape and the _UNK_ have obvious _UNK_ ,
Almost and _UNK_ in the rest of the picture .
And I &apos;m going to show you these _UNK_ patterns .
The strings are going to be in the _UNK_
I know you don &apos;t like to enjoy the _UNK_ .
But how do we understand the electrons in the _UNK_ model ?
_UNK_ : No , it will be part of this _UNK_ symmetry .
So in fact , when this shape moves around the air ,
It &apos;s going to _UNK_ . And the _UNK_ direction is
the particles that we see . So that &apos;s --
I &apos;m not going to think of myself .
Well , we know that electrons are particle ,
So this will allow us to see the smallest size .
So in the quantum theory , the way these things are
all the possibilities that are going to happen at the same time .
And that &apos;s why I get the _UNK_ analogy .
because the way the _UNK_ came in is
a shape that can be connected to each point in time .
And what I &apos;d like to say is that the shape of the curve
It &apos;s a _UNK_ way of _UNK_ it .
I don &apos;t know I can &apos;t explain it more clearly .
It has _UNK_ the interest of our interests .
Thanks for your visit . Your speech is too attractive .
or the ones that are going to be --
And you hear this call coming from the valley .
I &apos;m going to talk to you tonight
He talked about this amazing _UNK_ , called _UNK_ , three years old .
And we &apos;ve been able to look at the DNA
And _UNK_ _UNK_ , who was the late _UNK_ ,
is that he took me to study chimpanzees .
But his argument was that he had been looking for
in the early _UNK_ of Africa --
what it looks like in those early human beings .
But what do they do ? This is what he wants to know .
And he was going to have a _UNK_
If we find that the contemporary model of behavior
that are similar to the most species or the same .
So maybe these acts are about _UNK_ years ago ,
So , maybe the behaviors of our bodies
oh , if you look at the book of evolution ,
is often found that people are based on chimpanzees .
to think about how early human beings might be .
compared to other animals , they &apos;re more like us .
This is a little bit of what I &apos;m talking about here at TED .
So I &apos;m going to talk to you about today
is that chimpanzees are _UNK_ in their way .
And of course , I gave them names . They were 60 or _UNK_
And although we think most of them live in the wild environment is less than 60 years old .
This is the first child in the 11 or twelve years old .
and she &apos;s only about five years or six years later .
In this long period , the small chimpanzees are dependent on ,
At night with her mother , she slept on her back .
And we think that this is a long way
It &apos;s important to chimpanzees , and it &apos;s like childhood ,
We found that in a process of life ,
The young chimpanzees spent a long time looking at what their elders do .
We now know that they can mimic the behavior they see .
from all the different chimpanzees in Africa ,
and see the different behaviors of the tools --
How do these things go through watching , _UNK_ and practice
So , we can use these tools as a primitive culture .
There &apos;s no language , we &apos;ve mentioned it before .
But they did have a whole lot of _UNK_ and movements
And many of them are very similar to us .
and they have the same _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
They also _UNK_ , hand , and one _UNK_ another .
In the chimpanzees , we found a lot of
And as we , unfortunately , they have a dark side of nature .
They can be _UNK_ , even like a primitive war ,
In most cases , these are very popular acts .
is based on the individuals in adjacent communities .
I think it &apos;s better than other organisms .
chimpanzees are more helpful to us that humans and
The rest of the animal kingdom and no marked line .
And this line is very vague , and as we see more ,
I &apos;ve been studying this in 1960 until now ,
These chimpanzees lived in a complex social environment
We know that we _UNK_ with all kinds of animals on the planet , we &apos;re part of it .
is not going to be able to divide these animals .
There are so many other organisms in the world that are sad
You can see the forest covers the _UNK_ .
In 16 years , I went to the whole area
The small ones , only 30 _UNK_ National Park is located here .
&quot; How can we try to save these chimpanzees ,
and people living around the national park are struggling for survival ? &quot;
And there are a lot of people that are not weak land .
And as the refugees from the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Those people are very poor -- cannot buy anything else ,
a program that we call it a concern .
And it &apos;s going to be able to improve
who live in the village around the lake
It &apos;s starting to be _UNK_ . There are 12 villages . It &apos;s now 24 .
There &apos;s no time to introduce it , but the plan includes _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and being ready to reveal this film in the mountains .
so that these fields can be _UNK_ in two years .
to help the villagers get fresh water out of the wells
And the world , in all of our loans ,
to give girls a scholarship to get them to school .
And it &apos;s clear that all over the world
We provide planning and AIDS and virus information .
What happens is that in this 24 village farmers
that we don &apos;t think of as a kind of
who came up with a white white monkey
By the way , a lot of people now are _UNK_ .
in the village is a group of Tanzania .
and the villagers were talking to a group of Tanzania .
They &apos;re interested in health , and they &apos;re interested in education
And over time , as they begin to improve their situation ,
They begin to understand more about the need of natural protection .
The number of times the mountain was _UNK_
and the horrible land _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
Now , what we &apos;re developing is the big ecosystems
This is a place outside the national park .
because of these villages that live high standards
and put them in the _UNK_ of their land
so that when the _UNK_ came back ,
But as we &apos;ve been talking about all the days at TED ,
And the problem of Africa is that
so that the soil is exposed and _UNK_
At the same time , there are more and more trees
to develop food for them and their family .
There are other problems -- not only in Africa ,
and all the other developing world , and even anywhere on the planet
the standard of living in the United States
They &apos;re four today . But we don &apos;t have that , we have only one .
What &apos;s happened ? I mean , the question here is , we &apos;re here .
maybe the most intelligent life on the planet
that are the things that are working on .
But we _UNK_ the only home that we have .
&quot; How do this determine the next seven generations ? &quot;
Today , important decisions -- I &apos;m not here to talk about Africa .
talking about the problems of chimpanzees and the forest of death .
I grew up to realize how many African problems
is how to work with the colonial development
So I started traveling outside Africa , in Europe ,
You know what I &apos;m talking about , this includes pollution problems .
The air of our breathing is often poison us
water -- probably the water that we &apos;re going to face
One of the most important problems that we have
It seems that there &apos;s no way to profit from the past .
and the impact of the tsunami is getting worse .
And finally , people in the world started to believe
What happened was that our climate was _UNK_
The most adverse effect is that the poor
In many parts of the Sahara , _UNK_ is very severe .
And when the rain finally leads to flood ,
and more unfortunate , poverty , hunger and disease ,
And there &apos;s a lot of people who live in land
because all the land is _UNK_ , so you can &apos;t get away .
So there &apos;s a _UNK_ -- a little bit _UNK_ , _UNK_ --
At the same time , the trees were also _UNK_ .
This is not just in Africa in the world .
to meet so many young people , they look like losing hope
We seem to have lost wisdom , that is the wisdom of the _UNK_
And you think that in this case , you know ,
The TED technology , as an example of the brain ,
Is there a certain touch between the heart ? In the non - scientific term ,
with love and compassion . Is there any touch ?
These young people , when I spoke to them ,
Or painful , anger , they &apos;re more or less the same thing .
&quot; We feel that we feel that you damage our future ,
I have three little _UNK_ , every time I look at them ,
I thought , from me , how do we harm this beautiful planet
So we &apos;re going to do this , which we call _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
Now it &apos;s spread to the _UNK_ countries in the world .
_UNK_ looks tiny , but in the sun it _UNK_ --
The brick can be seen as the environment we &apos;ve made for the Earth .
thousands of young people all over the world
can break through , to all living , make the world better .
Every day , every one of us is changing the world .
We have a choice of every one of us in this room
We all have a choice about what we want to do .
And the poor people don &apos;t choose us to change these things .
&quot; _UNK_ and _UNK_ groups are going to take three options .
depending on the age of a member , where the country is ,
in the city or the country , to choose different kinds of solutions .
Basically , our plans to go to college
and more adults begin to build their own _UNK_ and _UNK_ groups .
three different ways to create a better world .
So one of their projects will help their own communities
And then , if they could be able to raise money ,
One of them will help animals -- not just wild animals .
One of them will help us share the environment
The message of all of these projects is that
_UNK_ and our own family and community ,
in harmony , including the countries , the different culture ,
between different religions , and between us and the natural world ,
We need natural world to continue to _UNK_ the world like this now .
We have only one of the Earth
And here in Africa , just select one or a _UNK_ .
just one or two schemes -- in Tanzania , Kenya , Kenya , Kenya , Kenya ,
and other groups . Like I said , over the world &apos;s _UNK_
And of course , they grow trees , they make organic vegetables .
You have to sell eggs , and you have some _UNK_ income .
because they planted their own vegetables to grow _UNK_ ,
to do these things that make them _UNK_ .
So there &apos;s no time to do more &quot; _UNK_ and _UNK_ &quot;
It &apos;s a very important part of the _UNK_ and _UNK_ plan .
young people are willing to listen to other children , rather than adults .
I want to travel around the world is this problem .
It took about a million dollars from the century
to the present _UNK_ . So many other animals are the same .
You can &apos;t come to a meeting like TED , but don &apos;t you want it , right ?
Of course , there &apos;s hope . One of the most amazing human brain
I was really excited to meet people talking about _UNK_ .
And we put all these water in the toilet , it &apos;s awful .
and talk about renewable energy , and it &apos;s important .
Do we care about the world for our children ?
How many of us have children or _UNK_ , nephew , _UNK_ ?
If you care about their future , as a global elite ,
We can do things . We can decide how to live every day .
and decided to do these kinds of choices
How does this affect him or her life when my child grew up ?
So the brain , with the human spirit --
And that &apos;s what TED is trying to help us .
_UNK_ helped us make maps of _UNK_ National Park .
Now let &apos;s get them up , it &apos;s going to happen , right ?
You &apos;ve heard this afternoon . It &apos;s going to happen .
change , if we care about the future ,
The next reason for the newspaper -- the _UNK_ of nature
_UNK_ time , there may be some help in this area ,
I tell you , in a _UNK_ tree that looks dead --
You don &apos;t need to cut down because you have a little _UNK_ ,
So five years later you have 30 feet of trees
will get the second opportunity . That &apos;s my next book .
It encouraged me . It took me to the final kind of hope --
We &apos;ve heard so much about it in the last two days .
So , you think it &apos;s going to be poverty ,
who have been _UNK_ , or whatever other people , can get out of the trouble
And sometimes they can be involved in society ,
if you think about one or two people out of Africa ,
with this ability to forgive , so he can lead his country .
out of the evil system instead of _UNK_ .
Ken , in Nigeria , against the _UNK_ of oil ,
And although all the people around the world , he was _UNK_ .
And this is what we need for young people in Africa .
We also need some models of the environment
So I thank you for this opportunity to share these messages again .
I hope some of us can come together to talk about these things .
The young girl at the center of the conference
She was thrilled to come and take her certificate . She was involved in _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
She was in the leadership of the _UNK_ ,
She said that she could do the work now .
and I was really excited to see her .
And this is just an example : when young people
is given to power and give the opportunity to take action .
is that we can evolved a sixth sense .
And when we need to make some decisions ,
TED , no doubt , is the best social place every year .
and said , &quot; Can you wait a minute ?
I &apos;m going to use phone Google for you . &quot;
Can you take the phone , open the browser ,
to get into a website and try to decide
the best thing to do is to decide .
So , my research team in my lab
to get this information out of it .
and it &apos;s still going to be improved .
And by the way , this device is now
A portable _UNK_ with a battery supply and a small mirror .
And these components are communications in my pocket ,
In the picture , I was a _UNK_ student ,
the information will be _UNK_ to the surface ,
You can put your nails into different colors .
For example , he could open a map of _UNK_ ,
the system will take pictures of what you have before .
And when he went back to the Media Lab ,
Some of you who are here two years ago
You might think that this system looks like a _UNK_ .
But _UNK_ , I can do this system at any surface ,
So the most important difference is that my system is completely _UNK_ .
Another more important _UNK_ , the equipment is going to go forward ,
is not going to be much more expensive than today ,
and I &apos;m not going to be as heavy as I &apos;m _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s better than I &apos;m going to be here .
This device , except to make you think of reality ,
and let you look like &quot; Tom _UNK_ &quot; --
What is really worth _UNK_ is that
It can actually act as a kind of _UNK_ ,
And we see _UNK_ now going to the supermarket ,
And when he took up a piece of paper towel ,
and show a green light or a _UNK_ .
According to his personal standards , it is a best choice .
Some of you may want to have the most _UNK_ toilet ,
When he picked up a book in the bookstore ,
These information are directly projected on the cover of the book .
And in the Amazon , it &apos;s got a lot better .
And then , when you open this book ,
you see more about the book --
The reader _UNK_ his favorite book about the book , and so on .
and he would see some of our friends
a _UNK_ that gives him a little bit
You can see the video reports of events ,
you &apos;ll see a little bit of a _UNK_ ,
In this case , we see the student interested in camera , and so on .
When you take out your boarding pass , it &apos;ll tell you the flight delay ,
And if you want to know about time ,
to be able to live in our lives ,
I was a _UNK_ student , who was a _UNK_ ,
He has been _UNK_ for the last three months .
His girlfriend must be a _UNK_ of the stomach .
But the equipment is not yet perfect now .
our brains will be _UNK_ in the _UNK_ .
and also one of the _UNK_ of the plastic _UNK_ .
The raw material that I built is _UNK_ and plastic .
And after eight years of dealing with plastic ,
_UNK_ a lot of small plastic pieces of plastic .
And the plastic is a lot of _UNK_ ,
is floating in the sea , floating in the ocean .
I know the Pacific _UNK_ and the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I think this is the first response to most people ,
We &apos;re going to go and clean up these plastic . &quot;
I plan to go to the garbage _UNK_ ,
and cutting it into a _UNK_ , and then it becomes a plastic block ,
They also studied the pollution of the ocean ,
And it &apos;s much better than it is .
I must think about it , and I want to _UNK_ the bigger blueprint .
We need to find solutions in the source .
Look at this , I know I &apos;m angry .
And you can imagine that in the middle of the Pacific ,
I &apos;m not just concerned about plastic _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to go to the supermarket and everything is plastic packaging .
I also focused on plastic in the _UNK_ ,
and the toxin of plastic and plastic plastic
I was with a group of other people
The ocean waste is plastic , and it &apos;s plastic ,
And then why don &apos;t we call _UNK_ _UNK_ :
and it &apos;s kind of like the idea of being .
You throw things into the garbage , but never thought about it .
In the United States , plastic waste is less than _UNK_ .
can be _UNK_ into a bottle of plastic ,
It was _UNK_ , making the bottle made small _UNK_ and made a bottle of plastic waste .
We look at it and let people think about another thing
I &apos;m now collecting these really cool _UNK_ glass vessels ,
to replace these _UNK_ and _UNK_ containers ,
And I know that I do this ,
We choose to use the stainless _UNK_
If you want to go out , remember taking the stainless _UNK_ ,
to get it to the water , or the _UNK_ ,
I guess what I want to tell you is that
I know you know a lot about the plastic pollution .
The plastic on the _UNK_ is a serious problem ,
But this is the problem that we make as consumers ,
And we &apos;ve raised the awareness of this problem ,
We can cut out the source and stop the plastic pollution .
I want to talk about a few things today .
I can see that all of you enjoy
the drinking water that was offered by the conference ,
I &apos;m sure you all feel that water is a safe water .
And if it comes out of this kind of water ?
I used to talk about data in the past ,
and the problem of drinking water for all people .
I , like most of you , sitting down on television a day after Christmas in 2004 ,
&quot; Well , &quot; I think , &quot; Here &apos;s the first country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
You know they spent five days getting water to New Orleans _UNK_ ?
And then I decided what I was going to do .
In the next few weeks and months I spent a lot of time in my garage .
It took a lot of time in my kitchen to make my wife look _UNK_ .
I finally made this , and I saved the bottles .
The best manual filters in the _UNK_ bottle .
So that &apos;s going to go through the 200 _UNK_ .
Well , I &apos;m going to give you a demonstration .
I spent a lot of time setting this up , so I think I should make a demonstration .
A good Oxford , I did what I did , a _UNK_ river ,
through the water . This is my _UNK_ water .
And if we were in the floods ,
So I made these things to add them into it .
And we put it in the same way .
and all these _UNK_ things together , and they lost it .
This is my friend &apos;s rabbit sent me a gift .
And we put this into it as well .
To give you a look , let &apos;s put some _UNK_ in ,
And that was a little bit more _UNK_ .
Well , I &apos;m going to take this _UNK_ water ,
put it here . Do you want to drink this water now ?
Let &apos;s see what Chris &apos;s going to show . _UNK_ ?
OK . _UNK_ bottles are used around the world .
_UNK_ the box and put it in a new one .
Then , a few weeks later , we set up a camp camp .
and the people would be forced to go to refugee camp .
Do you think what happens when _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
and start to rebuild their homes and their lives .
Let &apos;s rely on nature . She has a wonderful system ,
And then on the hill , the river and the _UNK_ put it down .
_UNK_ the water and become the _UNK_ of water .
so that mother and children don &apos;t take four hours a day .
We can use two billion pounds to make everyone have safe drinking water .
two million children per year of death ,
My son was in September 11 : 00 a.m.
We worry that the country will be the name of our children .
And the U.S. government is going to decide
When I was stronger , I wanted to _UNK_ the woman . &quot;
because when people heard that my son was victims ,
to give me a connection with the parents of the victims .
So it really means that it &apos;s a lot to me .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s alive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s _UNK_ .
And that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story ,
so that my pain can help other women .
And for all women , all the mothers of life ,
So , they don &apos;t accept marriage against their will .
If I could save a young girl ,
to avoid their early marriage , like I suffered ,
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m standing here in front of you .
And the day that we met at the beginning
_UNK_ , we worry about the _UNK_ of the country --
But I want to tell you how much I &apos;m sorry
And I thought that if someone had a crime ,
But she was in this way that she was _UNK_ with us .
This is , I want to say , this is a _UNK_ way .
And what happened was that we all told our stories ,
We feel like we always know each other .
as a woman , it can become so comfortable .
There is such a man who has such a hard fate .
I can meet some of the people I don &apos;t know ,
We &apos;re going to try to understand other people , other things ,
I hope that someday we will live together
the _UNK_ of the life of the _UNK_ .
This is a young kid from _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and the same thing that you hear in _UNK_
I believe that we &apos;re going to have a ship
to live at the same time in history .
and the order of power started to change .
These -- we know today that we see
In the same way , it &apos;s about a century
You may not agree that the last time --
is that _UNK_ and _UNK_ are aware of
the old country in Europe , the old force
The World War of the two times back and forth .
And Mao _UNK_ said it was a civil war
And this is what &apos;s going to happen to you .
For us , I &apos;m going to talk about three _UNK_ today .
And the first one of these things is that
As for the second , I call it a new field .
And it seems that it &apos;s not going to happen
We &apos;re going to talk about the power transfer
the power of the power of today , more include
and the constitution of the United States
It &apos;s a big part of the international stage today .
Now the power of the international and the world
the Internet , the _UNK_ of the moon ,
And the idea is that it &apos;s going to be
the 32 times the amount of trade needs
In recent years , they &apos;ve been pretty _UNK_
and it &apos;s not going to be _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to work in the _UNK_
But it &apos;s a _UNK_ of history , and it &apos;s going to be
There is no law in which the law is ,
and it &apos;s going to be growing , not just something you want .
And at the same time you &apos;re not going to be able to
Even if you &apos;re in the most powerful country on the planet ,
and it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ fund
about 60 percent of the time in September 9 / 11
Look , our enemy will also use these spaces
the collective transportation , the Internet , the satellite broadcasting ,
Now , this is going to destroy the _UNK_
If this is the fact that I believe
And the challenge that comes up , and it &apos;s going to be
I believe that the future of the future
is going to happen in a different way .
how many of the things that are going to work
And ladies and gentlemen , and I think ,
If we don &apos;t have the U.N. , we have to set up a conclusion
to _UNK_ the international action of the United States .
But when it &apos;s involved in the governance world ,
when the power is _UNK_ , it &apos;s really going to happen .
If you look at it , you see it &apos;s going to happen ,
In the case of necessity , he had enough power
Now we know that we &apos;re going to join
And this is _UNK_ : a legal institution
We &apos;re going to go back and talk about this .
If you focus on the power of power ,
Well , how did the people not join the _UNK_ ?
And then I went back to this issue later .
If you &apos;re in this chaos of chaos ,
I know that I &apos;m not going to give you
Maybe you &apos;re going to argue with me from civilization .
The West has recently increased in the Atlantic
We &apos;re seeing the important power of the act
And you &apos;ve seen that there &apos;s a lot of
to develop diplomatic policy and increase national budget
It &apos;s not just the West to the east .
but he had the background of the power .
in the world of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
is going to be the _UNK_ of Washington
The United States is the leading role of the world
And you start to see other power centers
Even though the rise of China is not going to be _UNK_ .
And for us , for the European Union ,
for the _UNK_ of Europe &apos;s power to concert .
Britain will join another party of _UNK_ and Rome .
when the world is governed by a single force ,
and the rest of the world is _UNK_ .
The Western countries are not going to act alone .
And we need to do the Arab Union
I &apos;m going to estimate Iran and Afghanistan
is going to be the last time in the West
We &apos;ve arrived at the _UNK_ of _UNK_
I say _UNK_ , because it &apos;s the Western _UNK_ .
You know , so far , if the West can act together ,
to deal with the financial crisis that we can
And we &apos;re going to have to go back
In the blue _UNK_ and the blue _UNK_
how many of the people in the U.N. headquarters
And of course , China , they are focused on _UNK_ .
And more and more , we have to deal with some
There &apos;s no common values that are going to happen
But at that moment , there was a common interest in people
and look at the emerging world today .
because people are talking about all kinds of things
in a way that we &apos;ve never seen before .
a country that has been _UNK_ in the country
or whether he has enough ability to do it ,
has started to influence the country in turn .
in the last war in the British Empire .
is that our Army has so strong that our Air Force has more power .
We have a lot of strength and our coalition forces .
And that was the enemy of the _UNK_
Now , if I &apos;m going to talk about national defence ,
I &apos;m going to go to the _UNK_ and say ,
because the epidemic is going to be safe
I &apos;m going to go to agriculture Minister and say ,
because the food safety threat to our safety
I &apos;m going to talk to the industrial minister
in the midst of the _UNK_ War ,
I &apos;m going to talk to the Minister of State ,
who lived in the house of _UNK_
There is a direct impact on what happened in the country .
It &apos;s like the _UNK_ of London in London
And the national security is no longer just
the military and the _UNK_ of the army
is that the economic model of industrial revolution
Ladies and gentlemen , our current structure model ,
_UNK_ said , &quot; Don &apos;t ask me about the first and the second law .
And the third law , is always beautiful , right ?
And the third law is that the _UNK_
that depends on what you &apos;re able to do
or a little bit of a business , or a _UNK_ ,
And if it &apos;s true , ladies and gentlemen
and they &apos;re going to be able to get together
In other words , we have the same fate .
If my nation is better than others , we are safe .
If my country is better than other countries , we are safe .
Our alliance , like _UNK_ , is much safer than the other alliance .
is because both sides know that zero and games are not .
One of the big obstacles in the Middle East
I think it &apos;s both Israel and Palestinian _UNK_
I start with a poem , and I &apos;ll end up with a poem
And the poetry was written in this way
is determined by the genes that we &apos;ve decided .
and 90 percent depends on the way we live .
So the premise of _UNK_ is that if we can find
And we can come up with a reality .
But if you ask a ordinary American , the best .
They may have heard about _UNK_ , or _UNK_ _UNK_ .
But we are really confused and confused .
You don &apos;t need to take the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and led a group of experts to these regions
and figure out what people are doing there .
At the end of my report , I will announce these _UNK_ ?
But first of all , I &apos;d like to show some _UNK_
_UNK_ : If you &apos;re very hard to try
In fact , only 5,000 people in the United States
In spite of the American _UNK_ and population growth of the fastest ?
and the next generation , you have their kids ,
An elephant , an elephant , or other , is the same thing .
So it &apos;s going to be 100 years old , not only do you want
There &apos;s a very good way of living , and you have to
And there &apos;s 99 possible to make us _UNK_ .
to get the brain , just a few minutes ,
The _UNK_ of the knee would hurt the _UNK_ .
our arteries will be _UNK_ . The brain is _UNK_ .
We have _UNK_ cells in our body
What we say here is the number of national debt .
These cells are turning over every eight years .
And these are the things that are damage
It &apos;s a little bit like it was in that time .
And we &apos;ll be able to copy the tape
The most _UNK_ scientific discoveries show that humans are _UNK_ ,
And it was obvious that there was a _UNK_
The study shows that _UNK_ is mainly from chronic diseases , like ,
We think that the best way to get this 12 years
to enjoy the culture of the world .
is much bigger than the ones we have .
And the country is going to come up with
And we found that the first blue area
It &apos;s about 30 miles across the coast of Italy .
It &apos;s about _UNK_ people , but it &apos;s not about the entire island ,
They &apos;re just living in a _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And the people in this area are _UNK_ .
Over 100 years , the 10 times the U.S. we live here
The place is not only about 100 years old .
to live in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
and you can beat the little people who are 60 .
their history back to the times of Christ .
is the culture of the bronze age of _UNK_ .
is the food that is _UNK_ in the field .
They found a whole wheat bread that was _UNK_ .
So the cheese has the _UNK_ acids .
And there &apos;s a kind of wine , and it &apos;s got _UNK_ content .
is that all the _UNK_ in the world
One of the most remarkable phenomena in the _UNK_ society
It &apos;s proven that not only are your old parents
and taught about four to six years of extra life .
The study shows that children in the family are also useful .
because the mortality and disease rate are lower .
the northern part of the island of _UNK_
The most _UNK_ woman was found in this place .
And the people in this place are the world
They lived long and often died in bed
They lived longer than the average American life .
It was five times the U.S. _UNK_ --
In the United States , _UNK_ and breast cancer is a powerful killer .
In fact , the number of these countries
There &apos;s a lot of green vegetables in the water .
They &apos;re the American _UNK_ who are _UNK_ .
is more important than what you eat .
You know , this is a big problem in the United States .
They eat smaller dishes , so they eat less calories every time .
On this type of meal , you &apos;re going to have no consciousness ,
They &apos;re on the bar and take the food away .
I think it &apos;s the best thing to eat .
This diet is well known , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ food .
These people just said a little bit about dinner ,
to remind them that they have eight _UNK_ of food .
This is a _UNK_ that takes an hour
to prevent you from doing the extreme things
But as _UNK_ , _UNK_ has very little social establishment
15 years ago , the average American has three _UNK_
If you &apos;re lucky to be a Japanese _UNK_ ,
And they call it the _UNK_ of _UNK_
If you &apos;re in good luck , you can share your hand .
We divided the adult life into two parts .
&quot; The reason you wake up in the morning . &quot;
It &apos;s going to go out for three _UNK_ a week .
And for this question , the Institute of _UNK_
to give us a survey of these _UNK_ .
And one of the problems is that their culture is high ,
There &apos;s a question , &quot; What is your life worth ? &quot;
They soon knew how to wake up in the morning .
The gap between the two women is _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
And she said to her head and she said ,
And we looked at the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And there &apos;s a really significant percentage of _UNK_ .
and the differences between men are more _UNK_ ,
The only thing they do is they have a set of _UNK_
No matter how busy it , the stress of the work ,
So they put everything down to God ,
In religion , their social _UNK_ , a fixed right .
It &apos;s not an accident that it &apos;s not accidental .
but it &apos;s going to be so _UNK_ every week .
There is no difficulty in getting the money .
The _UNK_ also wants to _UNK_ with the people .
You can &apos;t see people drinking _UNK_ or cigarette cigars .
They influence each other in a very profound way .
And in this culture , it was born in _UNK_ .
He said that I had to fix myself .
So the next three years he went out and went out
He still does 20 heart surgery every month .
It is a lively _UNK_ , swimming every morning .
He likes the stage on the weekends
Does her _UNK_ live in the _UNK_ of her _UNK_ ?
But let me tell you that there &apos;s no more protective than transit .
She said , &quot; stranger is a friend I haven &apos;t seen before . &quot;
We tried to get down to nine percent
It was really the expedition to the South Pole .
that are often used to work on the body .
and it &apos;s going to come up on the ground ,
The _UNK_ live in a vertical house , _UNK_ up and down .
Do the cleaning work and the home button will be used .
If you want to make a cake , you start yourself .
The burning heat is as _UNK_ as the machine uses .
is when they enjoy these things . They often walk ,
This is proven that the only way to prevent the cognitive decrease ,
They know how to arrange their lives
But what you have in a hurry or pressure
It takes 15 minutes a day to slow down .
one of the most dangerous _UNK_ in life
One was born because the baby mortality was high .
They live alive , and they have seven years
And these people drank a little bit of wine every day ,
It &apos;s not to eat meat but eat a lot of beans and nuts .
It &apos;s almost impossible to move them to the dining table .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do .
Take care of the children and the old parents .
Their communities are built on the basis of integrity ,
or the justice and justice are going to stay together .
and you have half of the obesity possible .
and it &apos;s going to be influenced at any time .
and they &apos;re drinking it in a good way .
_UNK_ , they put into work worth trust ,
and then you &apos;re going to have the biggest impact .
There is no use in food , there is no food in history .
the population of two percent of the population .
So it &apos;s the most important thing you can do for life and life .
And I &apos;m going to thank you for that .
I know my people probably know that I am right .
I have a chance to give the greatest _UNK_ expert in the world .
I first met him in _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
That &apos;s a game that we organize . The second _UNK_ study
The first _UNK_ a hundred human genome in ten days .
He said that his dream was to travel space
But I can get you to the state of _UNK_ ,
So , the only way to experience zero gravity is that
You &apos;re sitting on the plane and you &apos;re going to get 25 seconds
you can experience eight minutes of _UNK_ ,
When we announce that we &apos;re going to fly
We have a government department and a company pilot
Are you mad ? Don &apos;t you ? You have his _UNK_ .
After six months , we sat down at the Space Center
We announced that we &apos;re going to do a zero gravity flight
If everything goes well , we may be able to do _UNK_
We actually asked Mr. _UNK_ why to do this .
And what he said was that I was very moved .
And he said , &quot; Life on the planet is getting worse .
If there &apos;s no future in the universe , there &apos;s no future .
So I want to encourage the mass of interest in the universe . &quot;
We went to the center of Kennedy space
and went into NASA and went to the plane ,
and we have 20 million dollars in our lives .
We &apos;ve raised 20 million dollars for children &apos;s charity .
There are four doctors and nurses on the plane
We watched the blood content in his blood , his blood pressure and blood pressure .
We &apos;re going to have all the emergency measures
You know , you want to hurt the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The doctor said that everything was normal , and then we said ,
In order to express the respect of _UNK_ Newton , we conducted floating an apple
because Professor _UNK_ also had the seat of Cambridge
And then we did the fourth time , the fifth , sixth time .
And he didn &apos;t look like a 65 year-old man in _UNK_
In our lifetime we have left the planet
I looked at the problem from a slightly different perspective .
In the art , the real _UNK_ form
because art and science are really wonderful things --
They all have a lot of wonderful things --
_UNK_ , as the idea of being science and mathematics ,
It &apos;s like the perfect _UNK_ of twins
They are powerful and they are not _UNK_ ,
In fact , you can start playing some images ,
because I don &apos;t want to see myself on the screen .
for people in the non - science world .
They use their own unique ways to describe beauty ,
but only when you understand people who use language and grammar ,
It is true and true in this topic .
hidden and _UNK_ , and you can see life
It &apos;s really hard to understand these things .
Since I &apos;ve trained to become a medical painter --
He was a sculptor and my vision mentor
I want to find a solution that can help people
by using animation , using images and stories , etc .
that people don &apos;t have to know very well .
to be asked , by the professor , to understand
And here , they have a real and beautiful story ,
But the way they &apos;re taught is that they &apos;re _UNK_ .
And this is a way of doing it .
It &apos;s like a old chicken cookbook that looks like ,
_UNK_ chicken until the fragrance is completely _UNK_ .
We don &apos;t want to do that for our students .
So we have the opportunity to really open education .
A few years ago , I got to Harvard University ,
Robert _UNK_ &apos;s telephone . He asked me , I was with my team .
the medical and scientific education in Harvard .
So we &apos;re starting to develop a program for cell exploration ,
to connect all of the things together .
They thought that would form a vivid cell .
And these little machines are the center of life .
that will allow us to _UNK_ the world
They are made of amino acids in amino acids .
to make cells replicate , and they make our heart beating ,
And what we want to do is to do
How do you tell the story through animation
And this is the axis of the _UNK_ .
These animation , as a text script information ,
can actually discover the real _UNK_ of cells
and in the course of learning , it &apos;s going to take this picture
in the mind that their imagination was inspired ,
And then they could go on and move
to do a new exploration in their minds .
and finally found that the principle of life
So we &apos;re starting to study how these molecules are _UNK_ together .
We came up with a _UNK_ , which is that _UNK_ is moving through a _UNK_ , and they &apos;re collecting the signals from time and over and over again .
This signal is : there is inflammation of the _UNK_ , or _UNK_ , that is not known .
But what they get is that they stop them .
to make them _UNK_ and make them _UNK_ .
to make it change the shape of itself ,
and try to cross the skin vessels and figure out what &apos;s going on .
So these molecules -- we have to study with Harvard scientists who have to work with real atoms in their database , and how they do what they do .
and come up with a way that can actually actually show what &apos;s happening in the cell , but it &apos;s not exactly because it is impossible to see the cells .
I &apos;m going to show you a three - minute film which is the first part of our film book .
The plan has been finished , and it needs four , five years .
I asked you to see this and see the way these cells build these little machines that are moving around , and they drive the scale of the protein and the insect &apos;s length .
But these _UNK_ machines are really amazing , they are all based on life .
because all these machines are communicating each other .
They decided to happen in different events in the cell .
In space , cells can learn from the nucleus and produce the right part of it .
No life , from the smallest life to those of you ,
In fact , no machine , Chris , will be very _UNK_ today .
This is the _UNK_ in the cell :
This _UNK_ called a _UNK_ protein that he made a new series of proteins ,
anywhere in the cell needs -- whether it &apos;s a membrane or a _UNK_ , or whatever it is to be built or repair .
Every cell in our body , about 100,000 such _UNK_ , is running around and we have about 100,000 cells .
So no matter how many _UNK_ are , you &apos;re not doing anything .
When you go home , I hope you can think about this problem , think how powerful our cell is .
Think about the kinds of things that we &apos;re learning about .
Once we understand all the things that happened in the cell --
I believe that we know about one percent --
We will better control our health , our next generation , our lives .
And hopefully we can take it to find more realistic .
These cells , these tiny machines , really incredible , they can do what they need for .
They work together to make the cells work to do what they need .
This is what they never see -- they can work normally .
So I know a lot of new things in the news reporter .
And one of the things I learned to do was to be _UNK_ .
I left the newspaper editorial after my father died in February , I decided to travel .
And that was done because there were lots of things I wanted to feel and deal with .
I was camping every day and decided to stay in the car for a long time .
So , I took my cat , my _UNK_ and the equipment of _UNK_ to _UNK_ _UNK_ , but I didn &apos;t think it was all three times before .
Even if it &apos;s a very small room , it &apos;s worth _UNK_ .
The other people &apos;s negative words are serious about our own influence , if we let it go .
And there was time to express the emotion .
But later , the sad and _UNK_ of _UNK_ father died .
I needed a full - time job to pay my bill .
Whatever the car stopped , I was obviously _UNK_ with a cat and a dog .
The cat ran back from the car window .
No matter when , I can use a shower for office building and trucks .
The temperature in the middle of the night will drop to the _UNK_ below , so I can hardly sleep .
The ice was finished for hours in the _UNK_ and was very depressed .
I didn &apos;t find a flat , or I couldn &apos;t find a place for _UNK_ and cat .
But the hot weather _UNK_ me to get rid of 50 feet away at night .
I use the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ as a toilet .
When the winter came , the temperature went to zero degrees .
I met a bunch of new problems again .
It was impossible to get the police to _UNK_ with the police .
But I felt that I could not control my life .
I don &apos;t know how to happen , or I soon get out of a _UNK_ , a _UNK_ woman who lives in an _UNK_ car .
Then someone introduced me to a health clinic dedicated to homeless people .
I went . I didn &apos;t have a bath three days ,
I was as bad as the others in line , and the taste of it was _UNK_ .
And when some of the homeless people are going to look at it ,
They said , &quot; You &apos;re not homeless , what &apos;s the reason you &apos;re really here ? &quot;
And then he said , &quot; Well , when I heard my story ,
The clinic was _UNK_ to the side of my drug .
A year before he died , he was _UNK_ to a new book .
He was doing the _UNK_ , and he mentioned my writing .
And when I found that the _UNK_ was _UNK_ ,
And I lived in the _UNK_ park ,
I &apos;m a writer , or a homeless woman ?
So I went into a bookstore . I found a book .
I was standing there , and I read my book again .
Sometimes you live in the car and sometimes go to a friend &apos;s _UNK_ .
In the summer I became a journalist again .
I got the prize and lived in my own apartment .
So the homeless people who work for the homeless , most _UNK_ are hidden .
As long as there is hope , human spirit can overcome all difficulties .
I &apos;m not here to advertise for the homeless people .
I &apos;m not here to encourage you to _UNK_ the next _UNK_ you see .
And I &apos;m here to tell you , according to my past experience ,
or they decided in any time of life .
And three years ago , I lived in a stop
40 years ago , I was a young boy ,
a lot of people have lived in poverty .
So the first step is to ensure that children and mothers ,
It &apos;s not enough to control babies , and you need to have family plans .
_UNK_ , in my country , in my country ,
but it needs to be a doctor to do it . &quot;
And we asked for _UNK_ and _UNK_ , and they were women ,
But it &apos;s only a place to help the country &apos;s _UNK_ .
What is the left side of the _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ , &apos; No way , we don &apos;t have enough medical staff ? &quot;
So we &apos;re looking for the common people , and that &apos;s what you see .
The reputation that we were at the time was much bigger than Coca - Cola .
The crowd that they helped is our target population .
They are not only helping _UNK_ , but they are also _UNK_ .
to provide _UNK_ and _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
In this way , we find these people to help us .
They are actually helping themselves to do it .
You see these _UNK_ women -- in _UNK_ --
And then we decided to find religious people ,
We went to them and they said , &quot; Can you help me ? &quot;
I was here , the blue dress was me , not yellow clothes ,
Some _UNK_ do the same job in their own village .
The women said , &quot; No wonder we don &apos;t feel any side effects .
more than 20 million people in school learning and family planning .
A , B is a family , C is _UNK_ ,
We then have a game of intellectual chess , _UNK_ dice to play .
If your chess falls in the support of _UNK_ , then you can move forward .
Uncle bought a _UNK_ . Very good , uncle . Go ahead .
Uncle , don &apos;t use _UNK_ . Go back and come back . &quot;
The children also have these activities in the school .
The _UNK_ is the most intimate friend of the girls .
In Thailand , diamond is too remote to the poor .
If you &apos;re pregnant , then you can give us a loan . &quot;
It &apos;s not a real bank , but a foundation -- providing _UNK_ loans .
We don &apos;t need a big organization to manage the project .
In this case , you may hardly see a man in Thailand .
And the first American male can enjoy special treatment ,
The hotel lent us the _UNK_ to the field .
They said , &quot; Okay , we &apos;re going to have lunch .
It can be used for the choice of food and _UNK_ . &quot;
I think it &apos;s a symbol of a hot dog .
This young man named the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Look at him with only half the hot dog , and still enjoy it .
It made a lot of news in the United States .
I said , &quot; No . You come here . We &apos;ll meet all the needs . &quot;
You can call it a Coca - Cola strategy .
I &apos;m not sure that Coke knows us , or we learn them ,
And this is the result of all people .
The government was weak , and we didn &apos;t have enough doctors .
We had to stop the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
Unfortunately , the government has _UNK_ our actions again .
So , I thought , &quot; Since you can &apos;t help the government , I &apos;ll find military . &quot;
They said , &quot; Okay . You can use all our radio and TV stations . &quot;
In the end , we have a new Prime Minister .
He said , &quot; _UNK_ , do you want to join us ? &quot;
He invited me to join because he enjoyed my wife .
He became the president of the National AIDS Association .
Every branch of authority , even _UNK_ , must accept AIDS education .
As a return , we let every radio or television station
These high school students are teaching other high school students .
In the classroom the girl is much better than the boys .
that are safe for all school and HIV prevention .
These are the primary school -- four or four years --
without parents , because this is in saving life ,
The sick staff cannot work ; the customers who die cannot buy .
He was very popular . A _UNK_ was necessary .
Every country , every policy , needs a image _UNK_ ,
The job should be his best run by MBA programs .
We &apos;re giving them all over the streets --
The traffic police will send you a _UNK_ -- this is our _UNK_ project .
Can you imagine the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ to you ?
I don &apos;t have a problem . They &apos;re going to be _UNK_ .
Some people are looking for large scale weapons ,
But we found a large scale of protective arms -- _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ version of the _UNK_ ,
And this one I talked to you about --
In Thailand , we believed that God was _UNK_ ,
You can see , to make people live better ,
All hotel and school _UNK_ are saved from _UNK_ ,
Otherwise , you can &apos;t see how many _UNK_ are _UNK_ around the street today .
It &apos;s telling you that you can do the same force .
It &apos;s not just experts , doctors and nurses .
And then we decided to help people out of poverty ,
We &apos;ve successfully _UNK_ the spread of AIDS ,
These must be provided by the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
The only way to riches is to be a business .
and the money came into the countryside ,
They get the money they have to _UNK_ credit funds ,
Before the loan , you must pass through your training .
We believe that if you want to help
But before getting a loan , you must pass through training .
And so , they &apos;re going to make money .
This is a very interesting -- Nike &apos;s _UNK_ and cookie .
They said , &quot; They should stop production shoes and clothing .
And as on the left , we now make Scotland _UNK_ ,
This is a quote from Starbucks in Thailand --
Starbucks makes you sober , and we keep you sober and _UNK_ .
You can have a glass of milk , and you can get some _UNK_ .
We want to take advantage of the school resources ,
to make it a place for the rest of life .
I want to believe that _UNK_ is a famous designer
And of course , the baby mortality problem , and then the family plan .
We now have a large scale of protective weapons .
Thank you very much . In those of you who are smart ,
I &apos;m going to tell the story of passion
I &apos;m good at stories and want to tell you
I published some books in the last 20 years
But it was a pretty flat until February 2006
At the time I _UNK_ the Olympic flag in Italy .
It made me a famous man . Now I went to the mall .
Please let me tell the story of the _UNK_ in four minutes .
and I was told to be picked up
And I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s going to happen .
because I &apos;m not a _UNK_ and field player ,
In fact , I &apos;m just not sure that in the absence of _UNK_
They told me that this was not a joke .
I thought I was wearing a thick jacket
is Welcome to 80 Olympic _UNK_ in the world .
These _UNK_ will be able to compete in the game .
They are supposed to win , but they have luck .
a snow _UNK_ , a foot of ice , the wind speed .
is going to influence the outcome of the game .
But most important than training or luck -- is heart .
There is always no fear and the man who has strong heart will win .
The streets of the _UNK_ are _UNK_ by red _UNK_ .
to drive us and decide our destiny .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to describe in my book .
They asked questions , and they would have the risk
It &apos;s not going to be an interesting role .
In the green room I met some other _UNK_ .
Three athletes , and the actor _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
She planted more than _UNK_ _UNK_ , and through this behavior ,
and the _UNK_ _UNK_ who were _UNK_
When she was 14 , her grandfather _UNK_ her _UNK_ .
She told us that these girls were raped if they had sex with men .
and you can heal them with AIDS .
and the force of the _UNK_ _UNK_
If they revolt , they will be _UNK_ .
This is not the type of clothes I usually wear .
But this is not what I thought before .
All the _UNK_ put in uniform except for the _UNK_ .
She was sexy and slim and had the bronze skin .
How can you keep the bronze skin and have no _UNK_ ?
When the television interview was asked , &quot; How did she look so good ? &quot;
One of the most beautiful women on the planet
And we were called on the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
There was a _UNK_ in the radio , and the music _UNK_ .
By the way , it &apos;s the same music here .
_UNK_ stood in front of me , much bigger than me .
She &apos;s elegant , like a _UNK_ on the _UNK_ .
and put the flag on the shoulder , and I was in the back ,
_UNK_ the foot , and _UNK_ the _UNK_ ,
So my head was actually below the flag .
And I was fortunate , because of the pictures that came out there ,
And that &apos;s where most men are _UNK_
And my love , I think , is not respect .
even though I explained to him in private terms
I left all the _UNK_ of the four minutes
I &apos;m going to _UNK_ the Olympic spirit of _UNK_ .
to _UNK_ , where the place is located near a _UNK_ .
By the way , 80 percent of the world &apos;s refugees and refugees
These places are just the _UNK_ of the Congo .
Even if there was no death , it was eventually _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
was a young woman _UNK_ and her children
But she tried to maintain her seven children &apos; _UNK_
A few months later she had a pair of twins
to take care of them , to feed them with black tea .
when the soldiers ran into her house and tried to rape her large girls .
She grabbed her and she refused to refuse
even though the gun is worth the head .
And then you know , in the course of luck ,
she took her to the rescue of the United States
_UNK_ and her nine children came to _UNK_ .
The character of my book is tough and dynamic women .
They &apos;re not _UNK_ , they don &apos;t have to be _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been working with women all the time .
A long time ago , I was born in a very remote place
No wonder when I was five years old was a _UNK_ .
So nobody knows what I &apos;m going to do .
Soon , I found that I wanted to enjoy freedom
But I &apos;ll go back , because I &apos;m going to go back
When I was 20 years old , my daughter _UNK_
to me that _UNK_ movement , called me a good life ,
Indeed , for my daughter and all of you in this room , it &apos;s _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s not that good for other places .
that they don &apos;t want to be able to feed ,
that can &apos;t control their bodies and their lives .
was raped , sometimes _UNK_ by the _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ will never be sexy , but I &apos;m going to guarantee you
And I &apos;m also less affected by the lack of men .
It &apos;s just evolving , if you don &apos;t like it ,
The name is _UNK_ , _UNK_ , or vase , if you like it .
as long as we understand each other and understand it .
I &apos;m going to talk about a passion but a sad story .
This happens in a small woman clinic in Bangladesh .
In her three weeks of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
But when she got there , she found no doctors
No _UNK_ , the clinic flies around the flies .
Jane found the only way to get rid of the bad teeth
She had no license , and she never had to do it before .
And she started doing her pray , and she started doing surgery .
And finally , the patient _UNK_ her palm ,
And that day the _UNK_ had a lot of teeth
The next day , when she came to this clinic ,
Her first patient asked her to wait for her husband .
And _UNK_ had to look at her eyes .
the condition of the patient is not about surgery .
Her husband had a lot of money on the other day .
But they only have one percent of their assets
the same job they pay more than men .
Even if they get paid , it &apos;s easy to get hurt .
And in fact , if you give women education ,
Her children and family will benefit from their families .
She talked to women and explained the _UNK_ of land
She made the women grow new trees and _UNK_ them .
In five years or six years , they have a forest
The soil was _UNK_ , and the village was saved .
I &apos;m sure that if the women work together ,
can bring peace and prosperity for this planet .
In any war today , most of the victims are civilian .
The male master of the world and looked at all of us .
This is a problem that we often ask for ,
Is it right to have the world order to work ?
And each one could have a rich life .
In January I visited the exhibition of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
No museum or _UNK_ will show the work of _UNK_ .
They didn &apos;t have the courage to show these paintings .
There was a great deal of _UNK_ and insult painting .
I didn &apos;t have the way to get these images
I &apos;m afraid of the abuse of power and force
and then force other people to accept reality .
The rules are often changing , but always good for men .
In _UNK_ , the power of a layer
Women and children , especially poverty , are at the bottom .
Even the most _UNK_ men were _UNK_ by him .
I &apos;m not going to be _UNK_ by a few people .
I think the moment is now ripe
We need enough women to have the power of power
and the women in the heart of men
And here , of course , the young man
And the old man didn &apos;t have any money to wait for them .
And I really wanted to have _UNK_ _UNK_
But if it &apos;s possible , I prefer to have _UNK_
_UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ --
Why don &apos;t that ? It &apos;s going to be done .
Let &apos;s get out of the air chamber and roll up our sleeves .
This is one of the big problems of our time .
We are accustomed to , when we walk into the store ,
When we walk into the dining room , or after an hour , we went into the hall .
there &apos;s always a lot of food for us .
But when you think about every day , in a big city in London ,
and the same thing happens every day .
to be the most extraordinary scene behind me .
This is the _UNK_ of Brazil in _UNK_ .
We &apos;ve seen a lot of people who &apos;ve seen
So there &apos;s a third of the food worldwide
even though it takes three times more food
to feed a person , if it &apos;s _UNK_ food ,
It &apos;s not a very efficient way to feed .
is going to live in the city
and it &apos;s going to take twice as much
So the consumption of meat and the _UNK_ are common .
It &apos;s a big problem . If we &apos;re still growing like we &apos;re now ,
We can &apos;t solve this problem in _UNK_ .
And every year the _UNK_ forests were gone .
And even though we lose a lot of money
In Europe , we need 10 _UNK_ energy to produce one calories .
And even though the food we spent a lot of effort
half of the food in the United States
And finally , in the end of this long process ,
we &apos;re going to be able to feed our planet
We have a billion people obese , and more than a billion people are hungry .
When you find that 80 percent of the global food trade
As we move into cities , the world is taking the Western diet ,
More importantly , what should we do ?
because you can see it &apos;s a new moon .
And almost at the same time , at the same time ,
because agriculture and cities are closely connected . They need each other .
And the first time it made enough food
If we look at the places that were there ,
because the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ tissue
to collect these food , and to make it ,
and then _UNK_ all the foods that don &apos;t eat .
the spiritual and the _UNK_ of these cities
In fact , every city in the past is so _UNK_ .
And of course , it &apos;s not that small city .
So , how is the city that keeps the supply ?
In my eye , I call the answer to the old city ,
so that it &apos;s possible to import food from very far .
And this is the only way to achieve
because there &apos;s a lot of difficulties in the land
is just to get their food reserves
In fact , you can actually expand the Empire
In fact , I love the fact . I had to point out
_UNK_ ( Roman ) is imported from British _UNK_ .
But there &apos;s an interesting thing to do
If we look at the map of the 17th century ,
We can see the crops coming out of the Thames
because the market is in the south of the city
If we look at the names of a street here ,
And this is the same thing to use fish .
And the fish , of course , came out of _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is a famous _UNK_ market in London .
It &apos;s a very special thing , really , when you think about it ,
And there are fish in the harbor and _UNK_ .
because the animal is going to the city
When they came up , they arrived in the northwest part of the city ,
a very famous meat market in London , in this case ,
_UNK_ come from the east of the _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I felt that it was a little bit like a weather .
In fact , if you look at any map of the city ,
In fact , you can see how food is to shape a city
You will find a lot of clues through reading the street name .
is a place to buy fish on Friday .
But you also have to imagine that there &apos;s food everywhere .
is the only place to sell food food .
If you think about the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
you &apos;ll find it difficult to live in a city like this .
and the source of food that comes from .
You will probably hear the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
This is a picture of the _UNK_ railway
You can see , some of the early railway _UNK_
And one night , these animals don &apos;t go into the market .
The city needs to get food through hard ways .
And suddenly , they _UNK_ from the geography limit .
You can look at the map of London
It &apos;s a little bit easier to do it .
by walking through the animal to the market ,
and walk through the water , and you can &apos;t go anywhere .
And of course , this is just starting . When the car is replace the train ,
And that really marks the end of the process .
There is no smell of the original city .
because nobody wants to walk in this big block
In fact , they &apos;re all going to buy food .
and think about how to plan these food
And this is the moment that this is ,
The food used to be bought in the middle of the city
the most important part of the city
_UNK_ food was once a social activity ,
We &apos;ve got to make cooking , and now we just need _UNK_ .
Or some eggs , when we do cake or something else ,
We &apos;re not going to go to _UNK_ foods to confirm whether it can eat .
We just read the use of the _UNK_
We don &apos;t find the value of food , we don &apos;t trust it .
it &apos;s going to be waste from the value of it .
What &apos;s most _UNK_ about the food industry today
They make life a little bit more convenient .
because you can build a new city of freedom
but they are _UNK_ the connection of people .
And they also allow us to rely on this system
So what should we do ? What should we do ?
Before _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ used to ask himself
One day you &apos;ll see all the farms are crazy .
The small city is surrounded by the _UNK_ .
These _UNK_ are some of them , but they &apos;re starting to
And it &apos;s also a _UNK_ idea of conflict .
_UNK_ is a word that Thomas deliberately used
It looks like a joke . Because it has two _UNK_ in Greece
He can either say a good place , and he can express a place
because he &apos;s an ideal thing . We can &apos;t have it .
to think about the problems of human beings
If you recognize the fact that food can become a powerful tool .
a _UNK_ tool , design tools , to change the world .
If this works , what _UNK_ would be like
And I think that &apos;s what I want to do .
I take this picture because the dog looks cute .
This is the place of food in our society .
But to do that , you have to have these people
And he could be a man and a man
and you see a bunch of different _UNK_
We need this guy . We &apos;re all part of the whole thing .
because if there &apos;s no such people , there &apos;s no place
I deliberately chosen because this picture shows a man buying vegetables .
But the whole thing is that food is produced .
This is part of the life of the city .
because you don &apos;t have it , you don &apos;t have that place .
The place to grow food is part of the landscape .
This is a dish called Kevin , and he might have
is a kid called Kevin . I &apos;m not sure .
is important because they &apos;re trying to _UNK_ our relationship with nature .
So , _UNK_ , is another idea of view ,
If we did that , the city will not be _UNK_ .
But this is not a big theory .
because we don &apos;t need to have that kind of thing .
It &apos;s a very proper way to do a conclusion
I know the best way to do this is to draw
He _UNK_ the relationship between the city and the countryside .
I think he wants to convey a very clear idea
What is the _UNK_ of the great government
So we also know our food decision to the world .
If we adopt this idea , we can use food
as a powerful tool to _UNK_ the world
&quot; The _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot; --
&quot; There is no desire for what has been done . &quot;
It &apos;s not just a good day to do it .
And when you &apos;re going to stick up every day ,
you can get rid of the world of ego ,
But you know most of the time you don &apos;t know about it ,
This is the core of the religious life .
When the religious leaders gathered , they would argue a profound theory
or _UNK_ such problems as _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
When I talk to a lot of religious people ,
This is certainly against the purpose of the practice .
that I can talk to more , a wider audience ,
so we can treat _UNK_ , whatever they are , who are they ,
Can we pass the world to the next generation .
is to build a global society , like what I say ,
And religion , which should be the major contribution ,
Of course , it &apos;s not just religious people who believe it .
In my opinion , we have a choice now .
We can both follow , or emphasize that
The _UNK_ , the _UNK_ , was born in the _UNK_ times ,
And the foot stands up and down at the Jewish _UNK_ ,
He said , &quot; Don &apos;t make anything to the _UNK_ themselves .
This is all the _UNK_ of the law , and the rest is comment . &quot;
The _UNK_ and the early days of _UNK_
The Malaysia will have a show of art ,
But we can &apos;t just do that . You can &apos;t do that .
The religious education is where we make mistakes .
I &apos;d like to work hard for this one .
and we look at some of the other _UNK_
I never imagined that the _UNK_ will be _UNK_ to the network .
with a bunch of researchers in a room
But TED is going to give me a whole new story ,
because it was the amazing thing to be TED .
But I &apos;d like to quote a word for the end ,
a British writer , a writer from Oxford ,
But he had a deep _UNK_ in my mind ,
When I was a _UNK_ I read a word .
When two people look at each other , they look at each other &apos;s eyes .
And when two people were standing together ,
We don &apos;t need to fall in love with each other ,
We learned to live with others and understand each other .
but don &apos;t understand what it is to do .
And you love to use the digital product ,
Even for the grand _UNK_ , I might be surprised to say ,
And I said , &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot;
But when you &apos;re ready to do this book ,
It took two days to make computers and _UNK_ willing to cooperate .
you never want to read the rules before .
But it &apos;s just about yourself , or how do you go ?
to get a horrible message : there &apos;s no video _UNK_ .
And so my _UNK_ would have been _UNK_
I &apos;m going to talk about my famous work .
is more suitable for people who are _UNK_
or I can talk about what I care about .
So , I was reading architecture at _UNK_ Island ,
And that was the second half in the &apos; 60s .
Fortunately , I &apos;m going to graduate in the fifth year ,
It took my life in Rome . It changed my life .
And it &apos;s important to change my life at home --
It was an interesting age , and really wanted to read it .
It was also extraordinary for a year in Rome .
is a place where I remember my memory .
I &apos;m going to be in Rome , or do something for Rome .
I &apos;m painting to help you understand something .
I hope people believe that I know the things .
So let you see some of the pieces of Rome
I painted a lot of _UNK_ paintings
_UNK_ , I tried to look back to Rome as much as I could .
that are different kinds of materials , style and times
to draw the _UNK_ , look at all the details of the Rome ,
They can help to explain the experiences of my experience
to express my feelings and feelings of Rome .
Some small details are just recorded by the records .
Maybe because people make it grow up .
And there &apos;s a few _UNK_ between the building .
It seems to have a map of your mind --
than you see in the streets in general ,
I _UNK_ how to make the reader _UNK_ .
This is some of the _UNK_ of Rome .
and let you know that in Rome
If you go to the road , I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s a long time
This is a little map -- I started to think about the map .
Maybe it &apos;s going to be a little bit smaller .
And I &apos;m going to have a word here .
a little _UNK_ out of the back side .
And the word turned back to a fountain .
This picture is coming up and down to _UNK_ .
And it could be a story in this line .
Maybe I should take the map out of it .
_UNK_ showed me the part of the Roman Catholic
so that you can play a ball on the ball ,
like a lot of squares in Rome can see
to make it _UNK_ . And I &apos;m going to explain
and the ball is going to be different .
It looks like a little bit of a skill .
but it wasn &apos;t the _UNK_ that I tried ,
And I found that there was no content on it .
It &apos;s a great deal of work for many things .
And so I thought that a _UNK_ design was quite _UNK_ .
is sitting in a different way of transportation
like you look at the scene of the bird on the spaceship .
and walk in Rome , you can appreciate it more _UNK_ .
those wonderful lines and things that are hard to describe .
and found a robot that he designed
and it &apos;s going to do a little bit of a _UNK_ .
and the _UNK_ of the Roman city , and the size of them
or stay in front of them , it &apos;s like a ruler --
The whole book -- even though not the ruler .
It &apos;s not about to tell you how many _UNK_ are .
but you can compare it with the _UNK_ .
and so on , if you &apos;re happy to ,
This is _UNK_ , and she has only a _UNK_ .
She bought a spaceship , a small spaceship ,
A _UNK_ into a balloon having no holes in it .
and we started traveling around the air ,
This shows the _UNK_ of the river on the hill .
And there &apos;s a column of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
You know how big the diameter of the spaceship
As you can see , she starts reading the story around the columns .
It &apos;s a little bit too close to it .
And this is the scene that I can draw
It &apos;s not much better than that pile of houses .
And then the tall house , in the _UNK_ square --
The square is a _UNK_ frame , often in the face ,
The text is _UNK_ , and you have to go up and down ,
and you can come up with this book , and you can go from the ground
and the way she looked at it was ,
It allows you to move in space . And especially for example ,
from the center of the ground to the center of the _UNK_ .
Some of the _UNK_ that are visiting the _UNK_
from their perspective of the city of Rome
And the natural _UNK_ is to go up and down .
They got to the church at the time ,
In the _UNK_ restaurant , a group of people
It reminds her that she should have lunch , and she &apos;s also _UNK_ .
They went on to the _UNK_ Square ,
It was fast . The puppy _UNK_ was put in the basket .
_UNK_ down and took a purchase list of food _UNK_ .
until the afternoon , the market was in great business .
It will be seven to seven times the next day .
In addition , the puppy really took things back to the spaceship .
You see it in the upper left-hand corner .
So you want to find a place to eat lunch .
It &apos;s all _UNK_ , and it &apos;s very ideal to _UNK_ the spaceship .
The walls of the _UNK_ are _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
They &apos;re going to be here , and they eat _UNK_ ,
And they took the meal , and they _UNK_ it .
through the bathroom , it _UNK_ across the wall .
And then I &apos;m going to go to the _UNK_ pyramid ,
And then the trouble is , they get a little bit _UNK_ --
Her little story seems to have to be _UNK_ .
Another person , _UNK_ , is probably a _UNK_ ,
But at noon he needed to go to work .
The alarm clock had been out of five points when the alarm sounded .
He gets up , and he gets up , and he &apos;s going to walk away .
Every time work is completely _UNK_ in the _UNK_ of Rome .
I want to show you the speed of this guy --
And again , it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ ,
because there is a word on the bottom .
And the word on the side is _UNK_ backwards .
He walked all the way forward , close to a _UNK_ man .
It &apos;s just the _UNK_ of the two _UNK_ .
He was driving the guest on the seat of the hotel .
Everything he sees now is a little bit _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
But it &apos;s got to work , but it &apos;s important to work .
the idea of urban planning . Rome is growing .
to adapt to the needs of different times .
And it &apos;s consciously , and we &apos;re also pushing .
At the end of the _UNK_ dog made a _UNK_ jump .
If you &apos;re sitting in a _UNK_ car , you know ,
And this is a car that &apos;s going to drive .
And the last is _UNK_ -- his apartment is in the upper left-hand corner .
And tonight he talked about 40 years of _UNK_
He gave the candle and made the flowers .
is thinking about where the _UNK_ should be .
The telephone rang -- called him to the _UNK_ .
And he walked up and down and forth
But compared to _UNK_ , he was almost _UNK_ in the rock .
Everybody knew that he was responsible for repair television .
And at last , he came to the door
_UNK_ said that it was a big thing .
It was impossible to resist everyone to miss the game .
And so he looked at the wires in the basement
from all the way to the top of the building ,
He went up all the way up , and at last he got to the main _UNK_ .
Another _UNK_ of the _UNK_ , to the _UNK_ .
Open the window , of course , there &apos;s a desktop ,
And he also solved the problem of his own .
The table was set up , and he &apos;s going to do it now .
This is my first attempt , but it &apos;s not enough .
to convey the understanding of the Roman Catholic ,
to shape the power of the city .
and put them in the _UNK_ and keep their original size .
you can see the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ pyramid
There is also a _UNK_ of the _UNK_ , which is standing here .
_UNK_ , I think it may be time to let the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And you know , I &apos;m a little bit of a control of my work ,
It seems to be the clue of the whole book .
I suddenly realized , and so on , what do I do ?
It &apos;s not the easy tool for _UNK_ information .
you always have a layer of _UNK_ --
A page , in some sense , is in the _UNK_ .
Imagine the level . _UNK_ is a place in Rome --
And I thought , &quot; If you &apos;re going to _UNK_ a book --
And if you follow my ideas --
to show that the depth of these levels are very deep .
Most of the plaster of the Roman Union
_UNK_ the _UNK_ of many centuries of the world .
If I do a folded page on the page ,
You open it , and you see the tissue below the wound .
I know what &apos;s going on in the building .
What are some of the _UNK_ buildings in the corner .
and the brick and the plaster _UNK_ away ,
I can take you from a narrow street
Get into a _UNK_ square and put it in a double _UNK_ .
and you fold pages -- if you &apos;re like me ,
when you &apos;re a kid -- I &apos;m afraid you want to get your head up .
At that moment you go to the _UNK_ square .
And I didn &apos;t really do anything more complex .
But then I thought , maybe I could make a little bit easier
We &apos;re going to see the _UNK_ and the front _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m not going to open the whole book ,
If I &apos;m only 90 degrees , we &apos;ll be on the front side of the globe .
as if you look at the square in the sky .
If I change the book in a direction ,
And we look through the square and see the front side .
It &apos;s just a book that &apos;s completely open .
I think it &apos;s good , and it &apos;s worth trying
and even the folded pages together with the folds .
And the book is going to spread and continue .
I guess I might go to the right place ,
And so I went back to the story ,
If you want somebody to focus on it ,
read your book , and you can learn something and tell the story is good .
-- the question works . This is going to be a cross of Rome .
to show all the things I love Rome .
is the _UNK_ on the top of the church .
In the day , _UNK_ _UNK_ should do something , and fly back --
The _UNK_ and the green _UNK_ are _UNK_ .
So , I don &apos;t know how to get home .
So it had to find a new home .
This gives me the opportunity to draw the _UNK_ I love .
And we start with the higher ones ,
but it might have to go back to family --
And this is what happened in the _UNK_ .
But there should be someone to participate in it .
And I was _UNK_ by the old man
He &apos;s looking for them all in the town . The dangerous places don &apos;t refuse .
It also learned to do some tricks at lunch .
Unfortunately , the old man was ill and was ill .
He had been taught to _UNK_ his name
They didn &apos;t see him after four or four days .
All the _UNK_ were waiting for him , like the red balloon ,
They took him over and over the streets .
Every time he died of a _UNK_ , he _UNK_ it .
&#91; _UNK_ &#93; is a lot of progress in this book .
Anyway , I was at last convinced that if the packaging didn &apos;t work ,
I hope the title of the book can come to a perfect opening .
And this page is going to end up with me .
led to the answer : this is a story of a young woman .
She sent a letter to the carrier --
She lives outside the Roman town -- to give _UNK_ a man .
The carrier flew over the road over the road .
You can see the _UNK_ , _UNK_ and other rich .
You can &apos;t see the red line , you &apos;re the _UNK_ .
And the reader is going to get the reader
and it &apos;s going to be both necessary and possible .
Even if you haven &apos;t been to Rome these days .
And this _UNK_ did a _UNK_ thing :
It took a _UNK_ route . This design was designed .
to take the book over and over again .
So we _UNK_ around a week , and we flew over the Greek _UNK_
and almost hit the _UNK_ of _UNK_
is the rock built of the _UNK_ . _UNK_ !
I &apos;d like to show this to my students
And I think the only important perspective is that
But if you have to look for where the _UNK_ is ,
The _UNK_ went into the square and went to the front of the peaceful _UNK_
This is the scene I was hit by the football .
and the peace of the world , the football ,
A small part of the bird &apos;s wing . No feeling .
If you want to see the _UNK_ of peace --
And as long as it comes out of the other side ,
Through the _UNK_ , you can see the effects of the impact on the red line .
and the _UNK_ _UNK_ over the Middle Ages --
and looked at the dome of the Buddha Square .
And we &apos;ve seen it here , and we &apos;ve seen it .
This is the sculpture of the four rivers .
and stop in the hole in the middle of the _UNK_
We can _UNK_ in the _UNK_ because it &apos;s _UNK_ .
And it doesn &apos;t have to worry about gravity ,
The _UNK_ of this image can be _UNK_ .
and the _UNK_ were happy when he was in _UNK_ --
It &apos;s not surprising that this building doesn &apos;t work .
and it &apos;s filled with the _UNK_ and _UNK_ that I mentioned in front of you .
The sign of the neon light is some pretty _UNK_ above the top .
And finally we came to the front courtyard ,
He _UNK_ the paper from the _UNK_ . It was written
And the one on the top is that
and the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ flight ,
The red line is _UNK_ along the side of the line .
If you want to know more about it , give your virtual journey a little slower .
It &apos;s just going to be the paragraph of the _UNK_ .
What I think is the current condition of manufacturing ,
So in the current manufacturing , we have _UNK_ buildings --
But on the other hand , if you look at the natural system ,
then we can build things in a very powerful way .
And I think the key is to self - assembled .
If we want to build self - assembled in our own environment ,
all the complexity of what we &apos;re going to build --
We need to _UNK_ them into simple sequence --
We need some energy to activate it ,
that enable us to fold in the program .
We need some kinds of _UNK_ that we need
to make sure that our success is what we want .
So , I &apos;m going to show you some examples
And I was working with my colleagues ,
You need to fold the way you want to fold ,
every unit gets its own news -- like 120 .
It &apos;s rotating , and whether it &apos;s going to rotate ,
I mean , it costs thousands of dollars
Can we actually expand _UNK_ ? Can we actually _UNK_ robots in every part ?
basically _UNK_ the base of most computing modules ,
One is from user input , like you &apos;re building bricks .
Another one is to type a brick in front of the _UNK_ .
and then it will give the output of the three-dimensional space .
The user _UNK_ the brick in the way they want .
and your instructions are going to be calculated .
Now it starts moving in three dimensions --
Look at the left , 1 input is equal to 0 % output , saying _UNK_ down .
&#91; 0 , 0 &#93; input is a output output . It says up .
So the information that wants to build things has been _UNK_ .
It means that we have some sort of self - _UNK_ .
If you get wrong , you can replace a part .
All local information is embedded in it and tell you how to repair it .
So you have something that can climb , you can read it .
The last project I &apos;m going to show you is called the _UNK_ chain ,
It may be the passive self - assembly system
Every chain , or every element wants to turn right or wrong .
If you want to assemble chain , you need to program it .
To tell each unit is to turn the left or right .
Or a dimension , a chain is totally passive .
How does this _UNK_ the future of our future ?
that you can get a new chance of computation .
_UNK_ asked us to make a bold statement and make a _UNK_ .
I &apos;d like to talk about two things you know first .
The first thing is that this is actually
This is the Earth , or the solar system ,
unique to maintain our evolutionary , or create , as we understand before --
For our present survival , _UNK_ is our future survival .
There is a _UNK_ name today : the spaceship is the Earth .
In this concept , the spaceship is outside
And the interior is all the things we have to live .
We only had a chance : if we were going to _UNK_ our spaceship ,
And the second thing you know is that
that we believe in most of our history ,
It &apos;s not the center of the human being .
We &apos;re just in some kind of chemical dirt on the planet .
The typical star is located in the edge of a typical galaxy .
The first thing that you know about is that
It &apos;s probably like we are in a very _UNK_ place ,
And the second thing is that we are in a typical place .
especially when you think of these two things as a deep truth in life .
So they seem to have a little bit of conflict .
but it doesn &apos;t change the fact that they &apos;re completely wrong .
They &apos;re wrong . Let me talk about the second thing :
_UNK_ . Let &apos;s see -- this is a typical place ? Let &apos;s see if you look around ,
We &apos;ll see a wall and some chemistry _UNK_ --
-- and this is not a typical part of the universe .
What you &apos;re going to do is to move around a hundred miles in the same direction ,
You don &apos;t see any wall or any chemical dirt --
You can see a blue planet . If you move forward ,
You &apos;ll see the sun , the solar system , and the stars , etc .
But this is still not typical in the universe because the stars are in the galaxy .
Most of the universe , or a typical place in the universe ,
So we went on , until we walked out of the galaxy , and we looked at it ,
Yes , you &apos;ll see a big galaxy , its spiral _UNK_ showing us .
And at this point , we &apos;ve gone over 100,000 years .
But we still have a little bit of the typical place in the universe .
You need to cross the distance until you get to the center of the galaxy .
So what a typical place in the universe looks like ?
Here , TED is no cost . Give you a very clear set .
The lights are closed , and we can see it .
not so accurate , not very perfect -- see the space of the galaxy ?
This space is so dark that if you look at the nearest stars ,
And this star happened to be a _UNK_ explosion ,
When the light comes to you , if you look at it in a straight way ,
You can &apos;t even see the faint flash of light .
The universe is so large and so dark .
And it wasn &apos;t considered the light of the _UNK_ explosion ,
You will soon be killed in a few light years .
But in the _UNK_ space , it &apos;s so far that you can &apos;t even see it .
There &apos;s nothing . There &apos;s a vacuum that &apos;s much more
The best technology on earth can produce 100 _UNK_ of vacuum concentrations .
So this is a typical place in the universe .
If you turn it back , thank you .
So how do we understand such a remote environment ?
It was so different than what we know . It was so strange .
The Earth -- our environment , in this form -- creating knowledge .
What does that mean ? It &apos;s more distant to us --
I mean , starting with telescopes -- you see something like stars .
It means something like stars . It &apos;s not stars .
We know what they &apos;re . billions of years ago , billions of years ago ,
The substance at the center of a galaxy
The density of magnetic field leads to some energy in gravity .
to escape the form of massive _UNK_ space ,
However , compared to the physics of a _UNK_ , our brain is completely _UNK_ .
In this environment , we can &apos;t even even survive .
When we try to describe the condition of _UNK_ , language becomes unable to express .
It might be a bit like a _UNK_ explosion ,
But it &apos;s at zero distance and _UNK_ millions of dollars to the same time .
But the _UNK_ was so precise that billions of years later
On the other side of the universe , some chemicals can be described accurately ,
to build a model , and predict and explain , the most important thing -- you can get a reference .
It contains another physical system of accurate work models -- _UNK_ .
not just a shallow image , but also with images ,
This is knowledge . If it &apos;s not enough to give you a surprise ,
a structure expressed another accuracy of the _UNK_ .
And as the time goes up . That &apos;s how knowledge grows .
So , the physical laws have such a special nature .
the object , regardless of how different they are ,
but it &apos;s still going to be the same math and the _UNK_ structure ,
and it &apos;s getting more and more and more .
So we are special _UNK_ . This chemical dirt has its own .
the structure of the world . This is not anywhere in the universe ,
In itself , it became a _UNK_ center of all other universe _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
So , the profound thing is that
And the physical rule allows it to happen ,
is one of the things in the physical world .
So the solar system -- our environment , in our form --
How do you get a particular relationship between the universe ?
one of the right things in _UNK_ -- I mean , that &apos;s right ,
But _UNK_ is wrong . One of them is right .
It doesn &apos;t depend on any particular physics . It doesn &apos;t have special _UNK_ ,
There &apos;s no wonder . It just depends on three things we are wealthy .
One is material because knowledge is a form of information processing .
There is no need to be material to produce computers .
We need energy to build computers , and the most important thing is ,
to make use of recording the media we know .
The third thing is harder , but in the open knowledge and interpretation ,
But we often ignored the test -- the gravitational law of Newton ,
But we are accustomed to evidence , from a billion years ago in the corner of the planet ,
will continue to fall in the next billions of years .
and the rest of the science is the same .
And we know that the evidence of all science
is waiting for us to get on our planet .
We are full of evidence , and there is material and energy .
The possibility of creating open knowledge exists in the _UNK_ .
Just as I say , is there a cold , cold , dark , dark ? Is it so ?
There is a symbol in the _UNK_ space ,
with our house , the solar system . In our standard , it &apos;s very empty ,
But it still contains over a million tons of material .
A million tons of building , for example , the space station of the _UNK_ ,
And there &apos;s a bunch of scientists in this space where they &apos;re trying to create
And yet , the technology now even _UNK_ hydrogen
and turn it into other elements , and it &apos;s not going to work far .
If something is the laws of physics ,
So what do we know about how to work ?
In other words , this is a problem about knowledge , not about resources .
Similarly , if we can do that , then we will automatically get the energy supply ,
because the change here will be -- the evidence of the nuclear reactor ?
Or , it &apos;s dark . But what you need to do
_UNK_ , you see the same galaxies that we see here .
If you have a bigger telescope , you will see stars and planets .
In those galaxies , you can study the physical laws of physics .
to study the elementary particle physics , the chemistry and so on .
Maybe the hardest thing to do is to study biology , because it costs
for millions of years to go to the nearest _UNK_ planet .
But I have to tell you -- sorry , Richard --
But I was never so much a biological field ,
I think we can do it for millions of years .
So , in fact , space is not the premise of creating knowledge .
Any of these solids , in any place in the universe ,
is going to be the center of us ,
If the knowledge of this plan is really true .
If the _UNK_ space can create a series of open explanations ,
That &apos;s almost all other environments . The Earth is also polluted .
And the _UNK_ factor , it &apos;s not resources , because it &apos;s rich ,
This is a _UNK_ world -- I think it should be
-- it doesn &apos;t feel very ordinary . But at the same time we feel our fragile ,
because that means that if there &apos;s no specific knowledge to help us cope with the universe ,
We will not live in a steady challenge .
It &apos;s just a few years away from a _UNK_ explosion , we will be _UNK_ .
_UNK_ recently wrote a book about all of us ,
There is also the most important _UNK_ of _UNK_ weapons .
He thought that the human civilization could survive the century .
I thought he would tell you later in the meeting .
But I think this problem is not fit to describe the probability .
But I agree with him . We can live , and we may not continue .
But it doesn &apos;t depend on the probability , but we can create the knowledge in time .
This is a dangerous threat . The species have been extinct .
and the _UNK_ . Most of the species and civilizations
If we want to be an exception , the logical view of our only hope
is to use this characteristic of our population and civilizations ,
which is that we have a special relationship with physics .
We create new explanations and knowledge - as a central center .
I &apos;m going to use this to a current _UNK_ ,
not because I want to suggest that any particular solution ,
but just to explain some of the things I &apos;m going to tell .
I &apos;m a physicist , but I &apos;m not a physicist in this field .
I &apos;m just a _UNK_ . The way to a _UNK_ is ,
the scientific theory of serious authority . And based on this theory ,
Because if we have the best choice to stop carbon emissions ,
for example , by the Tokyo Act , to limit economic activity ,
and it costs about 100 million dollars and so on ,
So , no matter how to measure , this is a disaster .
The action of the _UNK_ is not even a problem ,
but it was just a little _UNK_ . So the disaster was all _UNK_ ,
or before everyone realized that the danger was too late .
It might be too late in the 1970s ,
And the scientific theory of _UNK_ told us
will lead to a new _UNK_ century , billions of human beings will die .
And this lesson is that for me ,
I don &apos;t know why it doesn &apos;t convey to the public debate .
The truth is that we never know . When we know that there is a disaster ,
to deal with the cost of this disaster ,
then there is no good argument about it .
to help us avoid the problems we haven &apos;t predicted .
So we need to be ready to solve problems rather than avoiding problems .
A _UNK_ is the case of a _UNK_ , which is the fact ,
But this is just what we know about .
If your nose was _UNK_ , the medicine wouldn &apos;t teach you .
If the medicine doesn &apos;t work anymore , it &apos;s only about research prevention ,
Now the world is busy with _UNK_ costs .
and it &apos;s going to go down and down the temperature ,
and how the plan is going to survive after temperature .
It &apos;s not cost , but it &apos;s _UNK_ , cheap plans . And some of these are already there ,
For example , a lot of mirrors are going to _UNK_ the sun ,
and _UNK_ the ocean for more carbon dioxide .
People are _UNK_ when they are dealing with this problem or in broad sense .
that we don &apos;t have consciousness , the ability to correct --
is not the absolute good luck of the _UNK_ period -- our only hope ,
We should pick up two stone , and at the top of the _UNK_ .
Another issue of the _UNK_ is inevitable .
In the rest , some people came up and asked me ,
And the only thing I think is that
And what I &apos;m going to tell you in this 18 minutes
And how do we do that ? How do we do
So we &apos;ve done a lot of _UNK_ sequencing over the last 10 years .
And at the end of this year , it was
We just got a grant from _UNK_ _UNK_ Foundation
that the rate of reading genetic code has changed .
The microbes form about half the biomass of the planet .
and went to the seaside to drink a _UNK_ of water .
maybe it &apos;s not going to be a _UNK_ .
So we decided to do something about this .
And now we &apos;re going to be able to
It &apos;s hard to work , and we &apos;re on a _UNK_
with different kinds of filters that are _UNK_ .
and took them back to the lab of _UNK_ ,
like the color of the eye in our eyes
that there was only one or two organisms in nature
and use sunlight as a source of energy
how many viruses and bacteria are floating around .
the top of the building in New York City
We just filter billions of microbes in a single day .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a moment
and the sample of the cold water in the ocean
And the other thing that makes us feel surprised
And we can predict the process of amino acids
including all of the data that we &apos;ve done so far
represent more than half of the genes on the planet .
We put these genes into the family ,
We &apos;ve found that the new member of the gene family
But every new sample we get from the environment
is just a linear addition to these new genes .
We are in _UNK_ , and we are working with animals .
is in 1995 , we have the second genome
If it _UNK_ into the middle of the genes , it _UNK_ the function of genes .
And so we found out that we had
But it turns out that the impact of the environment
We also tried to do a more _UNK_ study
We tried to compare their genome and see if they had _UNK_
So we got these _UNK_ circles , and we found that only _UNK_ genes
If you ignore the _UNK_ in a cell ,
that are going to be _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
is to build a chromosome with these genes .
And we have to achieve this goal based on expression .
and my colleagues and my colleagues and _UNK_
to allow us to take a couple of weeks
It &apos;s a very exciting experiment : we just _UNK_ DNA
and put it into bacteria , and all of a sudden ,
DNA is starting to guide the synthesis of particles
A year ago there was some kind of polio virus
This is a animation of the _UNK_ structure .
This is an example of software to build their hardware .
and we have a new idea for our biology .
I was also at the Senate committee
and the other one was founded by the U.S. government
I think the most important thing is to remember
People were immediately _UNK_ by _UNK_ viruses or _UNK_ .
But DNA from these organisms does not have the _UNK_ .
Only two countries , the United States and the Soviet Union
is that the probability of making a designer virus
I think it &apos;s possible for two years to make _UNK_ .
of the different _UNK_ and the different genes .
The key is , how do you put all the other genes together ?
that will continue to _UNK_ the radiation dose .
and they might be able to move around space
And what these _UNK_ do is really _UNK_ .
and the species are also able to do that .
So we think that synthetic cells will have great prospects
_UNK_ methane , living in the middle of the _UNK_
and depends on carbon dioxide in a caught environment
that are dependent on carbon dioxide in the world .
_UNK_ and Norway have a big project
I suddenly thought that there would be a new field
And we can design a design of
These _UNK_ can split complex sugar into simple sugar .
Finally , let me end with the study of ethics and policy .
We delayed the experiment in 1999 for the first time .
and it &apos;s going to continue to do it .
because a lot of religious leaders are taught and _UNK_
and can &apos;t find out the _UNK_ of life .
So this should be a little bit wrong .
But only after the beginning of this experiment ,
to determine the risks and benefits of the society
and also for the scientific team like us .
And at the same time we &apos;re trying to become a good example
in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ airport ,
to take the student in the green shirt ,
and it &apos;s not going to be a sound system .
And the system requires it to be
In fact , the price of cheap to another power company
So , the power company has no resources , no motivation .
He has already realized that the change system is a possibility .
to make it work for more _UNK_
The manufacturers who sold Nelson Mandela &apos;s cell phone
The President has been absorbed in the operating system of business
So he tried to change the current system
the president is not going to have anything to do ,
is that there &apos;s really a lot of challenges
Can we develop the system that change the system ?
And I want to say , &quot; Well , I want to say ,
Or if we give more choices to people ,
But the opposite of the two people is also necessary .
because you want to give the freedom of leaders
of the people in this economy that are free
&#91; the people &#93; want to continue to enjoy it .
So if you choose only one side , or a _UNK_ ,
But if we were at the same time to give both free .
to get us out of the _UNK_ system
And he said that if you want to see
how the system _UNK_ the people in the darkness
Look at the _UNK_ of NASA in the U.S.
than its neighbor , North Korea is like a black hole .
So we can change , we , humans , can change the system
But these two countries and Puerto _UNK_ are dark .
and it &apos;s not exactly the same thing .
because the government is so force , like North Korea ,
So if we want to create a good policy environment ,
We need to go through the process of building
In this graph , at the time of being picked ,
But China never used , at least in that period ,
any effective measures to encourage the spread of these ideas .
or a profit incentive to encourage transmission .
and then _UNK_ from the world , from _UNK_ ,
to become a very _UNK_ country in the world .
the percentage of the average income in the United States
_UNK_ , you can see it _UNK_ around the _UNK_ ,
China began to develop , and began to _UNK_
If you look at this map at night , you &apos;ll see
the reason that the _UNK_ of the Chinese system
You can see the edge of the _UNK_
In the 19 th century , Hong Kong was
to find places like _UNK_ , make toys and things like that .
but it &apos;s going to be a little bit better
so that it can be done in the U.K.
to be able to run the market economy
to the people who wanted this opportunity
So they created four special economic _UNK_ around Hong Kong .
There is an area in Hong Kong called Shenzhen .
to build all of you with the iPhone .
in the places where people choose to move
is that people are _UNK_ because of opportunities and conditions .
to bring the whole economy to the market economy .
If you change a village system , you can ,
is not going to give you a million people the same effect .
In another way , a _UNK_ change the system of the country is too big .
If you want to change the state system ,
&#91; can &apos;t focus on the future of the people , try to get a new system
to build a new system that people can choose ( try )
to the point that we can get a lot
When a million people have some effect on the new system ,
to attract people who build special cities ,
for example , the highway , the _UNK_ , the airport building ,
They will be hired to _UNK_ people in special cities .
the people who live for a long time
to raise children , to give them education ,
We can go over and over and over again .
We need to be perfect . We &apos;ve been talking about
And if we were allowed to allow
but no one was forced to be
And finally , we need to give the leaders to choose
to do something that is going to be free
We need to allow the countries to work together .
First of all , the building of a market economy
So as long as we allow this to work ,
We can expand the world &apos;s size of this effect .
and sometimes it needs to be _UNK_ .
a responsibility from one country to another country .
It &apos;s not . But it &apos;s important to recognize that this emotion is important .
And when we start thinking about this , these emotions will be
&#91; These emotions &#93; are going to prevent us from
&#91; _UNK_ &#93; we &apos;re going to explore the interest of new ideas .
and the _UNK_ of the project is that
whether it &apos;s good for leaders or to move people
It &apos;s a _UNK_ that is forcing and _UNK_ .
So we &apos;re going to talk about how to actually work ,
He &apos;s an example of the _UNK_ leader in Cuba .
He had the opportunity to go to Cuba
But Cuba &apos;s island is not as different as Hong Kong .
The southern part of the road is bright .
It &apos;s about twice the size of Manhattan
&quot; Look , the United States has a problem in public relations .
to make a new city building where it works .
and my citizens will move around there .
Many of them understand the meaning of special _UNK_ .
This is a new system that allows people to choose
There was no oppression , and there was no _UNK_ to the oppression .
&#91; The &#93; _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ &#93;
They can make a commitment to the long term
the ones that are going to be built
And if they &apos;re working with another country ,
This is a photograph I was _UNK_ over the Gulf
And there &apos;s a lot of people like this .
hundreds of thousands of people can live in
It &apos;s not a couple of , but dozens of special cities
in the next century to a special city
Look far from the world , if we look for bright lights at night ,
And the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ is that
The eye seems that most of the _UNK_ have been built .
These are the places that are already occupied
Now there are three billion people living in the city
If you move these points to the end of the rectangle ,
You &apos;ve found that there are three billion cities in town
only took up the land on the planet .
If we want to build cities to have a billion people
We take over the _UNK_ to take up the land
we &apos;re going to reduce the footprint of humans on the planet .
If these cities are in the perfect system ,
and they can be the people who are
And people can find a job for people
is to write some details that can be written
You might be able to manage these cities
But you can let us think about these problems .
There &apos;s Spain . Maybe Cuba wanted to go
to be a member of the four sides
How do we come to the draft of the agreement ?
There &apos;s no one . But it &apos;s going to be easy .
In value , you add up to a large number of cities
You can pay for _UNK_ percent of earnings .
like police , the courts and so on .
And there &apos;s education and the medical system
to make it a place for the _UNK_ .
to make it a place where it becomes a high income .
And so , you know , you know , you know ,
to build this area , to build the foundation of people ,
How do they provide a building that they can afford ?
and it &apos;s safe to be able to do it .
Some of us in the middle have been chasing this dream .
There &apos;s no way to do it , only do you think about it ,
And even though the Earth is so beautiful
And when they &apos;re thinking about it , they share with us .
And that &apos;s how we communicate with each other .
to give freely to the rules of certain knowledge .
Let &apos;s have a system that allows us to have
If we insist on the rules of innovation ,
you don &apos;t have to go to _UNK_ . Thank you .
Video : Okay , start counting . Over 30 seconds ,
_UNK_ , Adam , Haw , bite , I &apos;ve bite it up .
When the passion comes , moral _UNK_ will be broken .
that the girls who promised to _UNK_
Most people in the year are _UNK_ their commitment .
And these people didn &apos;t take any kind of safety measures .
They now have a cotton _UNK_ , if they can
You can get two _UNK_ when you go back .
And of course , if you really like _UNK_ , wait .
But it turns out that two children are _UNK_ to temptation .
because they have resistance . They are happy to be happy .
and try to find these kids and look at their present situation .
that the second _UNK_ child was getting 250 points in _UNK_ .
How big is that ! This is the difference between the two groups .
They don &apos;t have any problem , they &apos;re all good students .
They are confident and decisive . So what I &apos;m going to talk about today
What is that time ? It &apos;s going to be my next talk .
including us , how do you take time or time classes
The problem is because of these factors , ultimately , there is a _UNK_ of time .
because you learn to use some of these , and other things are rarely used .
The decision you do is based on how you act .
For some people , this decision is just based on the status .
Some other people are based on their _UNK_ .
for those who are based on the status ,
It &apos;s like , &quot; I &apos;ve been through something like this before . &quot;
So , they &apos;re based on the past experience to make decisions
We call these people , &quot; Look at the past , because they focus on
And one of them , they don &apos;t think about it now , not the past .
We call these people the future . Because they focus on the future
that you have a certain amount of _UNK_
In fact , there are six _UNK_ , two are now _UNK_ .
Two are in the past , and two belong to the future .
that you focus on the joy of life , or your _UNK_ .
by _UNK_ the spirit of flexibility to promote time insight .
So , what is the best time insight ?
In fact , the best time insight is by your past experience
&quot; _UNK_ through &quot; _UNK_ , you and your family , independence ,
There is always more than _UNK_ in any time .
You need to sacrifice sleep . So it &apos;s going to affect health .
I promise some of you in this room will _UNK_
And these _UNK_ , I was born in the South Bronx ,
in the _UNK_ Island . Everybody &apos;s in the _UNK_ .
I made more than all of my teachers .
because if you wait , you can eat two .
Now I learned to enjoy now , and also learn to watch positive experiences .
So , in my 20s , I felt that there was no power ,
Here I just want to say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to try to solve a lot of problems in the world .
_UNK_ to treat the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ -- create medicine .
in 50 percent of the hospitals that are _UNK_ .
a lot of _UNK_ in life will be solved .
In the next 18 minutes , I would take you
I walked on a journey that you didn &apos;t stop ,
50 years ago , the human first took the planet .
In this 50 years , humans are not only going to the moon ,
and sending robots to all eight planets ,
Our footprint is very close to the comet ,
Now , we &apos;re going to have a spaceship _UNK_ ,
All these robots are part of the human expedition :
a journey to understand and to understand our universe ,
to understand the origin of human beings , to understand the Earth ,
We can walk across the corners of the solar system .
We &apos;ve been on the planet for a while --
The exploration of Saturn is getting deeper and more _UNK_ ,
In 2004 , _UNK_ has entered the orbit of the planet ,
and it was a time when it was
Now , Saturn is a _UNK_ planet system .
Her _UNK_ , her new eyes and her _UNK_
to bring the universe to _UNK_ new discoveries .
to study her _UNK_ , and we learned a lot
We call the ring of the stars as a spiral galaxy .
This is a _UNK_ picture of the _UNK_ galaxy .
_UNK_ galaxies are the biggest spiral galaxies in the Milky Way Galaxy .
This is the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_
So the journey to Saturn is actually -- for example ,
I &apos;m sorry to show you all the _UNK_ information ,
because of the time in the last few years
I can &apos;t show you the beauty of the last two and a half years
But what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;m going to do it .
And the last two and a half years
The two most exciting aspects of the world
Saturn is surrounded by a group of _UNK_ satellite
And there are thousands of meters , some of them go from east to north .
In fact , the most beautiful picture of this
is the picture of Saturn around the satellite . This is a Saturn and _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ is actually very shallow , close to _UNK_ .
There are two _UNK_ in the _UNK_ of Saturn .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ . _UNK_ is the largest satellite of Saturn .
It &apos;s a _UNK_ shape for people who study planets .
And in fact , the climate of it
is very close to the atmosphere of the Earth .
at least for the past five million other planets .
It has a molecule of molecules , like we now have this room .
methane , _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
The contents of these molecules on the _UNK_
And these molecules are broken down and forming smoke .
And the smoke _UNK_ , and the whole _UNK_ ,
the _UNK_ that we see in our naked eye
It &apos;s not going to be seen on the surface .
In the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
The fog is attached to the surface of the earth .
I don &apos;t know what tar is like in the earth ,
And we &apos;re going to be _UNK_ . These molecules
especially methane and _UNK_ , under the _UNK_ of Saturn .
We find that methane is the water of the water .
And it turns out that this is what happens
For many strange ideas , the Saturn has methane cloud .
There are hundreds of kilometers high in the cloud
The light can &apos;t penetrate the ground of the clouds
The temperature on the earth is only 350 _UNK_ .
And although it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s still going to be _UNK_ .
Like the Earth , Saturn is forming a valley in the rain .
and the _UNK_ , the valley , the basin and the _UNK_ .
to wash up the _UNK_ of the mountain .
and then rush to the underground . You stop thinking about _UNK_ .
What is the surface of the planet going to look like ?
A month of Saturn is dark , like the Earth in the morning .
And there might be rain , imagine standing in the _UNK_
And in front of it , the shining glow
And before the advent of _UNK_ , we &apos;re thinking about Saturn .
We found that although there were differences in the details
but it &apos;s also amazing to be _UNK_ .
For us , the people who love _UNK_
It &apos;s like the fiction of _UNK_ becomes reality .
As I said , Saturn has a massive atmosphere
This is a picture of Saturn in the sun .
I don &apos;t know which one is . It &apos;s the atmosphere area .
The device on the _UNK_ can be seen through the atmosphere of Saturn .
And my device is also on the top
And the dark side of the _UNK_ , our device can only achieve that level .
It &apos;s a mystery -- how can we find the planet &apos;s surface
and look at what you &apos;re going to find
For example , this is what we don &apos;t know before , you can see
And then we came up with a hole
But there &apos;s not a few _UNK_ in the _UNK_ .
And that means that there is a _UNK_
This is the use of the _UNK_ detector .
_UNK_ seven years . We got this into the atmosphere ,
After two and a half hours of landing , landed and _UNK_
I &apos;d like to emphasize the importance of it .
the first time in human history landed with the Sun ,
We should be _UNK_ in the U.S.
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And the big reason is that this is a global mission .
In Europe , Germany , people celebrate the country
to celebrate the speech in the U.K.
The United States , Germany , France , Italy and Holland
This is a very exciting thing to you .
a real country participation in the future of humanity .
So , exploring a planet is a big task .
and the planets that are going to be
And I was all _UNK_ up here , as I said .
I &apos;ll never remember it , and you should remember it .
But the probe collects data in the landing process .
And the first picture of the _UNK_ is really _UNK_ .
And it &apos;s like this one of these things
It &apos;s amazing that we &apos;re looking forward to
The pattern of this _UNK_ is just the flow forming .
_UNK_ entered this valley and put it into that area .
Is it a liquid ? We don &apos;t know it .
This is a _UNK_ meter . Okay , look at _UNK_ .
OK , _UNK_ meters , eight meters --
And this is about the United States ,
This is the plane on the _UNK_ .
And finally , the probe is going to land
Ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m going to show you
The first picture of the Sun _UNK_ ,
It was obvious that the probe landed with flat , dark areas
The detector doesn &apos;t go down . So it doesn &apos;t fall into the _UNK_ .
The loose land is filled with liquid methane .
in the basin in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
And then the _UNK_ is going to land .
But the picture that we have in our photograph
There is no signs of water in the back picture .
Where is water ? When we find _UNK_ , it &apos;s all more _UNK_ .
This is what we call the _UNK_ zone .
The _UNK_ in these videos have 100 _UNK_
They &apos;re not going to be able to extend
This is 1,000 to 1200 kilometers a _UNK_ .
It &apos;s clear that if you don &apos;t dry , you don &apos;t have _UNK_ .
So , what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s no water
But then we found lakes in two places
This is a scene of the North Pole .
And it was just about 10 days ago ,
and the detector flew over the _UNK_
and found that the big image of the _UNK_ Sea
And what we know is that the liquid
There will be some seasons in the Arctic
And you will also think that _UNK_ is
It &apos;s amazing , mysterious . It &apos;s a foreign country . But it &apos;s all similar to the Earth .
This amazing planet is in the Sun ,
and look at _UNK_ . _UNK_ is a very small planet .
The big one is 10 percent . This is what it does with Britain .
It &apos;s just the size , not the Earth &apos;s safety threat .
-- this is the South Pole --
It &apos;s not the same color because it &apos;s different .
These _UNK_ are attached to this organic substance .
And at the same time , the Antarctic area
the temperature goes up . It &apos;s the highest area in the _UNK_ .
It was strange that the South Pole became hotter than the _UNK_ .
and look at some of the other pictures
_UNK_ the ice from these _UNK_ in these _UNK_ .
through the image processing of the light change .
In other images , there are thousands of people
I was working with my group on the image ,
Like this , there are other pictures of _UNK_
It may be a fluid , or an organism or a heat ,
which is the environment that life can survive .
No , you know , there are other planets in the solar system ,
If we can prove that there is a myth
I don &apos;t know a time , or two times , on the solar system ,
It means that through the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
in the history of the universe over _UNK_ years .
Now , the Earth is the only planet we know .
And it &apos;s the only home that we have .
For those of you who were _UNK_ in the &apos; 60s ,
You don &apos;t have to be that kind of person .
This is the first picture of the Earth in space .
This is a picture of the location of our planet .
and the responsibility of the home has a profound impact .
to say that the first thing to do
The picture of the human eye cannot be seen .
This is the other side of the planet .
and the _UNK_ are shining by the sun .
If these are not beautiful enough , then look at these things .
where we &apos;re going to go out of space ,
Maybe this one and a half centuries ago ,
And the reward for us is that
is that we know more about ourselves ,
and we &apos;re going to tell the story of news .
How many of these news is going to be
We tried to figure out that there &apos;s still a profound news story
I mean the news has been filtered through the above conditions .
Imagine you &apos;ve found the headline in the press last year .
is it going to affect 50 years or 100 years ?
But the headline last year was the economy .
This special economic _UNK_ would be the old man
If you &apos;re a mouse that has come ,
They build a robot that can _UNK_ in the body .
_UNK_ ? How are we going to meet people &apos;s needs ?
We heard yesterday that over 10 people were in hunger
Fortunately , Bill Gates put a billion dollars in a research
And the world will be different , if you make Chinese agenda set ,
They &apos;ve been more than the biggest car market in the world .
We &apos;re looking for all kinds of ways that we know about .
There &apos;s a _UNK_ of Argentina that is spreading to every continent .
There was a self - oriented robot who had invented a invention
But what I chose last year was the &quot; _UNK_ News &quot;
It makes the humans build simple _UNK_ on the moon .
or some of the people who have done it
that many millions of people need to help
The United States wants to _UNK_ and supplies into disaster areas .
But the map of the _UNK_ is not there .
There is no _UNK_ in the map , so it can &apos;t help _UNK_ people .
When we look at Los Angeles , the map of London
in 2005 only 15 percent of the world
in the same way that we can do it .
to create the _UNK_ of the world .
And at the same time we &apos;re talking here ,
And you can see the _UNK_ of Africa
that &apos;s a little bit closer to the _UNK_ road .
And every time I heard the problem , I was _UNK_ .
because I often get back from the Middle East
And the character of my case today is Palestinian .
Israel announced that it would _UNK_ a wall
And what happened in the field is that
We want it to go through the Palestinian _UNK_ .
Interviewer : The Israeli _UNK_ were _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : I know we &apos;re going to go out of life .
But a lot of people around me have no fear .
_UNK_ : We &apos;re going to be able to get us
and put the fence out of their land
And in this way , you know , your parents look at
I believe that the conflict in the Middle East
And in the Jordan River , the Jordan River
where the _UNK_ and the village in Jerusalem
They &apos;re going to be surrounded by a lot of land
And after two years of _UNK_ resistance ,
And when the villagers saw in a film ,
The story of _UNK_ became the leader of this movement .
If we don &apos;t care about these movements ,
There &apos;s the same way to contact the same talent ,
The same agent , consultant , and the media .
He will never be the only great _UNK_ of the time .
to build the power of the _UNK_ aircraft ,
I think about how the world works .
and it &apos;s even going to change the world
I found that all the great leaders in the world
whether the apple company , Martin _UNK_ or the White brothers ,
every single person on the planet , every organization ,
And the &quot; Why &quot; and &quot; no relation to profits ,
Why are you going to get up every morning ?
And it turns out that the way we think about it ,
the way to communicate is to be _UNK_ .
Obviously , the way we use is to start clear and _UNK_ things .
whatever the size of them is , in the area ,
I mean , the Apple company is simple to understand , everyone can understand .
Their marketing information is going to look like this :
and most of the ways that the market _UNK_ ,
We say what our profession is doing , we mean we are different , or how better we are better ,
We have the best lawyer and the biggest client ,
We are always able to meet the requirements of the clients .
_UNK_ oil , _UNK_ seats . Buy a single one .
_UNK_ , right ? You &apos;re ready to buy one from me .
All I do is to pass the order of information .
And the fact is that people are not buying a product you do ,
What people buy is not your product , it &apos;s your belief .
to buy MP3 player , cell phones , or digital cameras ,
And in fact , I &apos;ve said that Apple companies are just a computer company .
_UNK_ and Apple companies have the same ability to make all of these products .
A few years ago , the company launched a flat - panel television .
And in fact , we can &apos;t imagine
Why would you buy MP3 player from a computer company ?
I &apos;m saying that these are not one of my ideas .
When you look at the _UNK_ of the brain ,
you find that the human brain actually falls into
The two parts in the middle are our two _UNK_ .
And the brain is responsible for all of our emotional ,
In other words , when we are _UNK_ ,
Yes , people can understand a lot of complex information ,
We are in the direct control of behavior .
They would say , &quot; I know what these data and graph mean ,
Why are we going to use this verb , &quot; _UNK_ ? &quot;
because the part of the brain that controls decision
We have to say , &quot; I don &apos;t know why , it &apos;s not right . &quot;
Or at some point , you call the _UNK_ ,
I don &apos;t want to split these ideas too completely , but my heart and soul are not .
The control of decision - making behavior rather than language .
If you don &apos;t know why you do what you do ,
and other people have to respond to your motivation ,
for your support , from you to buying something here ,
and want to be what you &apos;re doing ?
And again , the goal is not to sell something to them ;
but it &apos;s going to sell something to you .
The goal is to employ those who have common beliefs .
If you hire someone to do this job , they just work for you ,
But if you hire people who have common beliefs ,
They will give you a _UNK_ , sweat and tears .
And this is not the story of the Wright brothers .
_UNK_ into mobile phones , like the hot website today ,
&quot; Why are your product or the company failed ? &quot;
It &apos;s always the three reasons , so let &apos;s analyze it .
It &apos;s also learning to work in _UNK_ , the contacts are very wide .
He knew the best people at the time .
But why don &apos;t you even hear him ?
They use the bicycle store to pursue their dreams .
There was no one in the _UNK_ team .
The New York Times is more likely to be _UNK_ .
He wanted to have his fortune and wanted to be famous .
the people who are _UNK_ with White brothers ,
and fight with them and fight with them .
And then the story goes , every brother goes out and goes out ,
have to take five parts of the world ,
But there was no other people here at that time .
that we know a few days later .
He resigned on the day of his brother &apos;s success .
I could improve your technology . &quot; But he didn &apos;t ,
It &apos;s not your product ; it &apos;s your belief .
You will attract people who have the same beliefs .
But why do you get people who have the same faith ?
If you don &apos;t know the rule , you must know the idea .
In our society , there are _UNK_ people
and the people who are in the room
The only reason that the final part of the action is to buy the button .
And although we &apos;re going to be in a different curve ,
But the laws of innovation tell us
I like to ask the company , &quot; What &apos;s your new business ? &quot;
They will be proud to tell you , &quot; Oh , maybe 10 percent . &quot;
Yes , you might have been there in 10 percent of your customers .
We can make 10 percent of the people &apos; _UNK_ ,
like to describe that feeling , &quot; Oh , they &apos;re kind of _UNK_ . &quot;
The question is , how do you not become your customer before they are .
to find those who are capable of _UNK_ , and those who don &apos;t know ?
As the _UNK_ said , &quot; _UNK_ across the gap . &quot;
And these people , _UNK_ and early _UNK_ ,
from the _UNK_ of their _UNK_ in the world ,
This is the first day in the iPhone .
to go up and wait for six hours to buy ,
And if you wait a week , you can walk into the store
will cost about two million dollars to buy a person ,
It &apos;s not your product ; it &apos;s your belief that people buy .
is because of their _UNK_ of the world ,
It &apos;s not your product ; it &apos;s your belief that they bought .
The success element is full of capital , good people and good market conditions .
It &apos;s about eight or nine years ago since the launch of the _UNK_ box ,
They &apos;ve been the only quality of the market ,
For example , I often _UNK_ things to my digital video recorder .
The price of the stock is about 30 to 40 dollars ,
And then the line drops , and the sale price has never been over 10 dollars .
In fact , the price of this transaction has never been more than six dollars ,
They said , &quot; Our product can stop the television show ,
It &apos;s not your product ; it &apos;s your belief that people buy .
And there is no dates on the Internet .
And Dr. _UNK_ is not the only person in the United States .
It &apos;s not the only one in the United States
He didn &apos;t have any _UNK_ in the United States ,
He just told the people about the _UNK_ .
and by his inspiration , and they started
to get these words to more people .
and supported them for eight hours of bus ,
_UNK_ up in the middle of Washington in August .
is the belief that they believe , not the struggle between black and white .
There are two laws of law in the world ,
until the _UNK_ of the laws of the world
and the laws of the laws of the God ,
And the civil movement just happened to be
By the way , his speech is &quot; I have a dream , &quot;
Listen to the current 12 _UNK_ _UNK_ plan ,
Some people are _UNK_ , and others are leader .
How do you remember how to stop the parking space ?
We &apos;re starting to look at the brain , the yellow region ,
You will lose memory , and the _UNK_ will stop where the car is .
A similar constituent of the _UNK_ and other regions of the sea are composed of neurons .
The _UNK_ area is composed of two layers of cells ,
Now , imagine , we &apos;re in the _UNK_ of this mouse
Every time this cell sends a small peak voltage ,
and then there &apos;s a red dot and a _UNK_ .
And this neuron will respond to it .
And then this cell goes through a small peak voltage ,
So we can transmit the frequency of this cell
If we recorded a lot of different neurons ,
a different neuron cell will generate their own electrical signals ,
some of the patients play a video game ,
And then when they were _UNK_ around the town ,
is going to be activated and sent a signal .
How do you know that mice or people are in a position ?
And when the mice walked in the middle of the box ,
So when you expand the box , the corresponding signal activity area is expanding .
The mice made a response to the _UNK_ barrier .
So when you put it in another barrier ,
to understand the boundary -- like the buildings around us ,
The cells on the left , you can see ,
And the cell is going to respond to it ,
whether this boundary is a side of the _UNK_ ,
and even the mouse _UNK_ around the table .
whether this boundary is a desktop or a desktop ,
It &apos;s even between two tables that are _UNK_ off .
the way to location the animal &apos;s location is .
We can also test that humans are in the simple environment ,
And then let them go back to that environment ,
and often they can be remembered according to memory .
and accurately marked the position of the object .
we &apos;re going to change the shape and the scale of the environment ,
the shape and the scale of the environment ,
to understand how the flag is going to happen .
Imagine the location of the _UNK_ in the flag ,
And then you ask people where they are ,
It looks like you are stored in a certain way .
the signal pattern that _UNK_ the location cells .
And then when you go back to that place ,
you can see the signal in the brain right now .
And this process allows you to go back to the old place .
We can also _UNK_ ourselves through the displacement .
and it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ in the reverse direction .
_UNK_ cells can also be seen from a cell called _UNK_ .
to get this kind of circuitry of information .
If you &apos;re writing a series of &quot; _UNK_ &quot; --
Each cell has a signal that can form a mesh , _UNK_ through the environment ,
And every cell that &apos;s set up with the other cells ,
green is this , and the blue is this .
It &apos;s kind of like the _UNK_ and parallel lines you see on the map ,
can pass these cells to the next neuron ,
The same grid is _UNK_ , and here &apos;s the _UNK_ sign ,
and all the mesh cells around the network
We are moving in the direction of six .
A _UNK_ movement between six directions is moving in one direction .
We can do MRI scans for people ,
_UNK_ , you see a _UNK_ cell on the cortex of the brain ,
And they have the same position as the _UNK_ cells in the brain .
He might remember how he walked out of the parking lot ,
And that &apos;s the signal that &apos;s _UNK_ on the Web .
And so the way that _UNK_ is successful
is just looking for him before he walk .
A signal set in the form of the brain .
But he still knew where the car had stopped , so he would go back to _UNK_ .
will find that this signal is widely distributed ,
This kind of network signal is going to be active ,
For example , when you try to recall the wedding ,
So when we tried to recall a scene that was in the middle ,
At least the whole scene can be _UNK_ with imagination .
The memory form is _UNK_ : _UNK_ cells are connected
The mesh cell can make the crossing of the space .
They &apos;re like _UNK_ , they &apos;re going to respond to you .
where you need to form the _UNK_ image in the brain ,
In the event of the wedding , the process can let you recall all the time .
The act of a single neuron cell that moves ,
the process of human psychology . So how people think about memories and even think
The first letter in the English alphabet is A .
