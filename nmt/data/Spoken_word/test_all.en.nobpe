For a good marriage , travel the same way to work
Shared dreams and ambitions can help make a successful relationship .
But it seems the rather less romantic link of a shared commute can also help .
Married couples are happier if they travel to work in the same direction , says a study .
Experts believe it makes couples feel they share wider goals in life .
They say the findings suggest newlyweds should consider choosing a home that requires them both to commute in one direction , rather than one located at the midway point between their two work places .
&apos;Couples ’ marital satisfaction can depend on whether they commute to work in the same or different directions , &apos; said lead researcher Irene Huang , from the Chinese University of Hong Kong .
&apos;Physically moving in a particular goal-relevant direction ( e.g. commuting to work ) might become associated with more general goal-related concepts.&apos;
They quote the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry , author of The Little Prince , who said : &apos; Love does not consist in gazing at each other , but looking in the same direction together.&apos;
Huang and her colleagues found a clear correlation between commuting in the same direction and higher marital satisfaction .
They also found that this link existed independent of other factors such as number of years married , number of children , income level and differences in actual time spent commuting .
Furthermore , the link did not depend on whether or not couples sometimes left home for work together , meaning it was not due to having the chance to talk together while commuting .
The second survey involved 139 married adults in Hong Kong , who were 42 years old on average and had been married for an average of 13 years .
It showed a similar correlation to the US results , which also held independent of other relevant factors .
Parsing China &apos;s conflicting economic data
You can get whiplash from reading the economic news coming out of China these days .
One month the skeptics hold up weak industrial output and exclaim , &quot; Crash ahead ! &quot;
The next month , the bulls are back celebrating things like China &apos;s 7.7 % GDP growth last year .
The latest sign of China &apos;s economic to-and-fro was the recent stock selloff .
Chinese shares dropped by 15 % over the last couple months , doubling the decline of other emerging market shares , in what seemed like a panic signal from traders worried about China &apos;s ability to weather upcoming obstacles , including tightening runaway credit and undergoing a massive pivot away from huge infrastructure projects to more sustainable economic growth .
The reports have been back-and-forth for the past six months , but overall they hint at some dark clouds ahead .
Here , then , is a breakdown of the indicators &apos; recent history , where the economy is now , and where it could be headed .
Six months ago , China &apos;s Purchasing Managers &apos; Index , or PMI , a key gauge of the economy &apos;s strength , was hitting 16-month highs .
The economy looked to be stabilizing after a couple disappointing quarters .
The PMI news boosted confidence that the country &apos;s new leadership in President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang could tackle rampant shadow banking and banks &apos; excess-lending without killing growth .
The chief concern back then seemed to be how much the Fed &apos;s cutback in bond purchases , or tapering , would hurt China &apos;s economy .
The good spirits were followed by skyrocketing housing prices through the end of last year .
Prices rose nearly 30 % year over year in December in Beijing and Guangzhou .
At the same time , prices in some of the country &apos;s smaller third- and fourth-tier cities fell .
There &apos;s now a break in the market : China &apos;s most affluent cities are still booming while smaller ones are starting to falter .
&quot; If they continue to drop , that will mean banks will have more nonperforming loans , and they will have to further contract lending , &quot; says Ran Tao , Acting Director at Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing and professor of economics at Renmin University .
&quot; Finally , if there &apos;s a credit crunch , the housing bubble may burst . &quot;
That could start in the smaller cities , and then make its way to the bigger ones .
Rising real estate prices can be healthy for any economy , but in China they &apos;re rising so fast that the odds of a crash are growing with them .
In January , an unnamed source -- most likely the government -- bailed out a $ 500-million risky bank investment called Credit Equals Gold No. 1 .
While China averted the first default in its trust industry-- an industry that last measured around $ 1.6 trillion in size and is tailored for rich people searching for high-interest investments -- the news wasn &apos;t encouraging .
What does it say about other bad bets lurking in the shadows ?
Was this reminiscent of two Bear Stearns hedge funds blowing up in mid-2007 , which intimated problems elsewhere in the financial system ?
In the beginning of February , China &apos;s PMI fell to 50.5 , a six-month low ( above 50 signals growth ) .
The numbers came just after the news that China posted still-impressive 7.7 % GDP growth in 2013 .
The PMI number was scary because it portended a potential deep slowdown as the country tightens credit and shifts away from a reliance on exports .
Everyone knows China eventually needs to shift its economy , but that process won &apos;t necessarily be smooth .
The falling PMI was a reminder of that .
And about that emerging markets selloff the past couple months : Deutsche Bank took a closer look at the figures and found something revealing .
The analysts focused on the difference between the stock performance of China &apos;s H share index and A share index -- the difference being that H shares are listed in Hong Kong and widely held by global investors , whereas A shares are listed in the mainland and not open to foreigners .
What they found was that during the two months leading to mid-February , the A share index fell only 6 % while the H shares dropped 16 % .
They concluded that the stock market wasn &apos;t punishing China , but throwing it out with all the other emerging markets .
They wrote , &quot; The only meaningful explanation for the 10 % under performance of the H share index is the indiscriminate selling of emerging market equities by global investors . &quot;
The stock market offers some optimism for the Chinese economy facing plenty of other ups and downs .
6 Tips for Expanding Your Social Circles
Whether you ’ re interested in advancing your career , or having a new group of friends to go out with , you need to learn — and perhaps master — the skill of making friends .
In this article , I would like to share with you 6 tips that will help you expand your social circles .
Connect With Connectors
A great way to expand your social circle is to connect to someone through whom you ’ ll meet many other people .
Those “ connectors ” are the types of people who keep friends on Facebook by the thousands , host parties whenever they can , and always seem to be with a large group of people .
Oftentimes , these are very open people and are easier to connect with than you think .
They might not have the time to invest in a deep friendship with you , but they love to get to know more interesting people to add to their circle .
Meet New People Constantly
A great habit to have is to always be meeting people that you can add to your circles .
In reality , not all the people you meet will become your friends and not all your current friends will be around forever .
This is why I always say that if you ’ re not making new friends , you ’ re actually making fewer .
I recommend that you go to places where it ’ s easy and appropriate to walk up to anyone and introduce yourself .
Ideally , you need to go to places where others are open to meeting new people as well . Examples might be trade shows , opening nights , galas , cultural or charitable events , seminars , and talks .
Establish Yourself As a Giver of Value
When meeting lots of people , you have to “ hook ” .
Nothing hooks better than having a giver attitude .
First , listen really to what they say and imagine if you were them ; see the world through their eyes .
Second , be willing to share stories , contacts , or quick advice on what people are talking about .
When you meet new people , there are some psychological principles that determine whether or not they ’ ll want to meet you again .
This works on an unconscious level .
One of the most important principles is the giver / takerattitude .
If they sense that you only care about yourself , connection isn ’ t going to happen .
You can portray a giver attitude in two ways .
The first is about really listening to what they say , imagining the world through their eyes , and giving them your opinion on their stories and situations .
The second way is to prove that you ’ re ready to share similar stories about what they ’ re talking about , or introduce them to someone who could help them .
Commit to a Local Community
One of the fastest ways to boost your social life is to get involved in a community that has the type of people that you want as friends .
This community should be in your local area and should hold social get-togethers once a month , or more .
What you do is find one that you like , maybe on meetup.com , and offer your help to the people who run it .
They ’ ll most likely accept , even if they don ’ t need that much help ; they ’ ll just be glad you ’ re interested .
This works great because it makes you meet everyone , and because it establishes you as a giver of value .
Reach Out to People On a Regular Basis
Staying in touch is vital if you want to keep your social circles alive .
You need to follow up with the people you just met , and catch up with existing friends .
The challenge here is that we tend to get distracted and forget about it , and regret later on .
To solve this problem , you can create a weekly ritual , where you spend only one hour calling , texting , and messaging people .
Just mark on your calendar a specific day and time , and do it every week .
A great time to do it is Tuesday or Wednesday , as it gives you the opportunity to make plans with people for the weekend .
Know the Kind of Friends You Want in Advance
Before you start investing more time on making friends , do a little planning .
Try to figure out what kind of people you want to hang out with .
List out a few qualities , character traits , or interests that you like , and don ’ t hesitate to be a little more ambitious than usual .
This is important because it allows your mind to quickly tell if a person you meet could be a great fit for you .
5 Realistic Reasons Why Women Cheat
As far as stereotypes go , a wandering eye and the urge to jump into bed with multiple partners seems to be built into a man &apos;s DNA , but when it comes to cheating , the sexes are created more equally than we think .
( Cough , Kristen Stewart , cough . ) Renee Lee , a relationship expert with a masters in psychology , dishes out five reasons why women cheat .
Going Through A Transition
&quot; If it is graduating , turning a certain age , losing a parent or advancing the relationship status , women become introspective , &quot; explains Lee . &quot; Even if it is something she wants , such as just getting engaged or graduating , the transition can stir up an array of emotions about where her life is going or where she is in it . The discomfort of change can trigger an impulsive desire to find someone to take her focus off the change and be a diversion for what she is going through . &quot;
2 . Not Feeling Adequately Celebrated
We &apos;ve all been here : &quot; May it be getting a promotion , organizing a fundraiser , or making Thanksgiving dinner for a party of 20 , men often make the misstep of &quot; not complimenting their partner &apos;s achievements , &quot; Lee says .
&quot; Women seek an emotional connection that their partner notices them , is proud of their achievements , and appreciates what they do , so when they aren &apos;t getting this at home the residual effects lead to feelings of frustration , dissatisfaction , depression , and restlessness . &quot;
And that &apos;s when they could go looking for it elsewhere .
&quot; When you are living in the day to day with someone , it is challenging to step outside a situation and notice the things that do matter to someone , &quot; adds Lee &quot; As this wears down over time , so as soon as the woman encounters someone who ignites the spark they are lacking at home , they equate it to an emotional connection and seek companionship with someone else . &quot;
3 . Feeling A Relationship Ending
&quot; When a woman feels that uneasy sense that a relationship is on the outs , by either her doing or his , she will often look to fill the void externally to soften the blow , &quot; Lee reasons for a woman &apos;s infidelity . &quot; If she is the one considering the breakup , she may be using this tactic as a challenge to herself both testing the waters , and then gauge if she can go through with it . &quot;
4 . It &apos;s Just Not Fun Anymore
... But it &apos;s too hard to pull the plug .
&quot; When you don &apos;t laugh , you don &apos;t love . Laughter is one of the key elements in a relationship that often gets overlooked , &quot; Lee explains , simply .
&quot; When stresses of day to day life become the dominant factor in a relationship , women feel unhappy . When they come across a coworker , or friend that they have a good time with , it suddenly brings to light what is missing in their own relationship and becomes tempting to act upon . &quot;
5 . It &apos;s Boring In The Bedroom
Men aren &apos;t the only ones who need to spice things up .
&quot; Women need to feel desired ! &quot; Lee declares .
If she is not getting any , enough , or nothing to talk about , women start to feel a sexual void .
With the popularity of books such as Fifty Shades of Grey , television shows , or listening to friends talk about their fun single trysts , women have that moment when they compare their love life at home to what the rest of the world seems to be experiencing . &quot; And that &apos;s when she may start to wonder what she &apos;s missing .
&quot; Though it is easy to pinpoint the flaws in one &apos;s sex life , it is often hard to make the changes needed to correct them , &quot; adds Lee . &quot; This creates a temptation in women to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere with someone they don &apos;t have the baggage with and can be more uninhibited . &quot;
Now you know why women cheat .
But we say , if you &apos;re thinking about cheating , just break up with the guy , before you move on to a new one .
Y Combinator &apos;s Paul Graham : Get a co-founder
Paul Graham has touched a lot of startups .
Not in the sappy , sentimental way -- though some founders may largely credit him for their success -- but where influence is concerned .
Because few in the Valley can claim they have interacted with , advised , and funded as many early-stage businesses as Graham has .
Indeed , Y Combinator , the startup incubator he co-founded with wife Jessica Livingston , Trevor Blackwell , and Robert Tappan Morris , has seen 632 startups come and go since 2005 , including Dropbox , Airbnb , and online payments platform Stripe .
Last week , Graham announced he was stepping down as Y Combinator President , handing the reins off to partner Sam Altman .
In doing so , Graham will still offer advice part-time to YC startups but cease day-to-day administrative tasks like poring over applications and interviewing applicants .
&quot; I spend all the time on that crap , &quot; Graham half-joked onstage at this year &apos;s LAUNCH Festival in San Francisco .
Graham also offered some parting general startup advice , culled from nine years of running YC .
Get a co-founder ...
Businesses are more likely to succeed with more than one founder , because each co-founder may bring different strengths .
Graham used Apple ( AAPL ) as an easy example : Steve Jobs was a pro with sales while the tech-focused Steve Wozniak couldn &apos;t have cared less .
That &apos;s why Graham usually tells YC applicants to get a co-founder .
In fact , that &apos;s exactly the advice he offered Dropbox CEO Drew Houston when he applied for YC in 2007 .
Houston supposedly did just that , recruiting MIT classmate Arash Ferdowsi in two weeks .
Now , seven years later , Dropbox has raised $ 350 million in its latest round with a valuation of $ 10 billion , far less than the amount Graham recalls Houston would have been willing to sell Dropbox for in the early YC days .
&quot; The answer was definitely under $ 10 million -- it might have been under a $ 1 million or $ 2 million , &quot; he recalled .
But get a co-founder you actually like ...
Basic ? Sure .
But you &apos;d be surprised how many startup founders actually don &apos;t gel .
With YC &apos;s three most successful startups -- Airbnb , Dropbox , and Stripe -- much of Graham and crew &apos;s acceptance decision was based on the co-founders themselves and how well they got along . ( Of course , a promising idea didn &apos;t hurt . )
And if they don &apos;t ?
Well , that &apos;s easy to tell quickly enough , even during a YC interview , which spans a pithy eight to 10 minutes .
&quot; One guy literally rolled his eyes when his co-founder was talking and pitching us -- a surefire tell , &quot; Graham said .
Focus on a specific subset of users ...
Longtime startup investors usually have one startup that had a nifty idea but never quite took off .
For Graham , it &apos;s Etherpad .
Released in November 2008 by Appjet , Graham accepted the startup into YCombinator because he &quot; liked the idea so much . &quot;
Essentially , Etherpad was a Google Docs ( GOOG ) competitor : a feature-rich , web-based text editor that let multiple users collaborate , write , and edit documents in real-time . ( Google acquired the software in late 2009 . )
Problem was , the product lacked focus .
&quot; They should have launched it as one thing and let people realize , &apos; Hey this is much more than real-time typing , &apos; &quot; Graham offered .
Instead of a catch-all approach , Graham said the secret to growth is starting a &quot; small , intense fire &quot; -- first focus on a subset of users and meet their needs .
Again , Graham brought up Apple as an example : The company produced just 200 units of its first personal computer , the Apple I , but sold 175 of them within the first 10 months on sale , largely to computer hobbyists .
Explained Graham : &quot; You &apos;ve got to know who those first users are , sit with them , have a party , and focus on them . &quot;
Why foreign leaders love Silicon Valley
Foreign leaders visiting the United States can fill their itineraries from a long list of fabulous destinations to conduct international diplomacy .
Scenic mountains , balmy beaches , and a certain city that never sleeps would seem like top contenders .
But instead , presidents and prime ministers from around the world are flocking to Silicon Valley , the land of office parks and suburban sprawl .
Getting to know top executives from Google ( GOOG ) , Facebook ( FB ) , and Apple ( AAPL ) , it turns out , is almost as important as photo-ops and meetings in Washington , D.C.
Last week , French President François Hollande became the latest such figure to make a pilgrimage to the world &apos;s technology capital .
In the last few years , leaders from Israel , Ireland , New Zealand , Turkey , Russia , Netherlands , Lithuania , and Malaysia have also visited .
Their interest reflects the growing muscle of Silicon Valley companies and venture capitalists , with which heads of state are trying to curry favor in hopes of attracting business , investment , and any political cachet that comes from championing innovation .
&quot; They &apos;re looking for jobs , &quot; said William Miller , a former provost at Stanford University who accompanied a number of foreign delegations in Silicon Valley over the years . &quot; They also have a feeling that a larger company -- whether Intel or Google -- could locate there and become a magnet for others . &quot;
During his brief visit , Hollande met with dozens of top Silicon Valley executives .
A private lunch included Eric Schmidt , Google &apos;s chairman ; Sheryl Sandberg , chief operating officer at Facebook ; and Twitter ( TWTR ) co-founder Jack Dorsey .
In addition , Hollande opened a new technology incubator in San Francisco for French startups , which aren &apos;t exactly taking the world by storm from home .
Incubators devoted to just one country , which are often sponsored by foreign governments , have fast become a Silicon Valley fixture .
Israel , Ireland , Denmark , Germany , and Australia are among those with beachheads that support young companies and help with access to U.S. investors and partners .
The playbook followed by foreign leaders is well-established .
Get off the plane in San Francisco , hold a few events to highlight their enthusiasm for all things tech , then mingle with a few well-known tech executives over a gourmet lunch or at a town hall meeting .
In 2012 , Shimon Peres , Israel &apos;s president , made the trip to Facebook &apos;s headquarters during a four-day tour of Silicon Valley to promote Israeli startups .
During an interview on stage with Sandberg , he described himself as a fan of social networking .
People can use it , he said , to work around governments and achieve peace on their own -- although peace in the Middle East seems to be just as elusive now as ever .
Last year , Haiti &apos;s prime minister , Laurent Lamothe , made a rare trifecta by visiting the headquarters of Facebook , Google , and Apple in one stateside trip .
It was an opportunity to ask wealthy technology companies to help his impoverished country , which is reeling from a devastating earthquake , with jobs and aid .
The companies donated free servers and some premium online tools .
But few Haitians have online connections at home , and pledges were small compared to the country &apos;s myriad problems .
Like many heads of state that visit Silicon Valley , Hollande was trying to send a message back home that he supports innovation and is working to turn France into a &quot; startup republic . &quot;
But many French entrepreneurs accuse Hollande of undermining them with a new law that sets the top tax rate at 75 % .
Avoiding the tax issue in public comments , Hollande threw out a welcome mat for American investment in French companies .
Of all the American investment in French companies , one-third comes from California , he pointed out .
&quot; In California , you want to change the world , and it &apos;s a beautiful mission -- a very ambitious mission , but one we really understand because we have the same vision , &quot; he said in a speech at San Francisco &apos;s City Hall .
For centuries , France wanted to change the world , and together we can change the world .
We can change the way we consume , we produce -- the way we deal with health or technology in order to make the world a better place .
Usually , foreign leaders steer clear of the differences they have with the technology companies they &apos;re courting .
No need to inflame tensions , after all , over issues like privacy , human rights , and regulations .
Hollande &apos;s government is probing whether technology companies like Google , Facebook , and LinkedIn ( LNKD ) illegally dodged taxes .
Moreover , France recently punished Google for privacy violations by requiring it to post an embarrassing notice about its misdeeds on its home page for 48 hours .
Google did not respond to requests for comment about Hollande &apos;s visit or his government or targeting it with investigations .
Facebook would only give a vague statement along the lines of , &quot; Let &apos;s all work together . &quot;
&quot; We welcomed the opportunity to meet with President Hollande and some members of his government for an open discussion about France and its role in fostering innovation and attracting foreign investment , &quot; Facebook said .
The phenomenon of foreign leaders flocking to Silicon Valley isn &apos;t entirely new .
François Mitterand , another French president , toured Silicon Valley in 1984 , during which his wife Danielle , peppered Steve Jobs with uncomfortable questions about worker welfare like overtime pay and vacations rather than gushing about the technology , according to Walter Isaacson &apos;s 2011 biography of Jobs .
Before Silicon Valley &apos;s rise , foreign leaders visited factories in the Rust Belt .
Now , it &apos;s the same idea , just a different growth industry .
Silicon Valley leaders reciprocate some of the attention they receive .
When they go abroad , they often find a warm reception .
Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook &apos;s chief executive , met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a trip to Japan in 2012 .
And last year , both he and Sheryl Sandberg , Facebook &apos;s chief operating officer , met with South Korea &apos;s President Park Geun-hye .
Meetings aren &apos;t always courtesy calls . In some cases , some real business-diplomacy is done .
Last year , in a joint meeting in Paris with Hollande , Google &apos;s Schmidt signed an agreement in which the company pledged to pay $ 80 million to help French media companies build their presence online .
The deal settled a dispute in which French news outlets accused Google of stealing their content by showing snippets of their work in search results .
What do Silicon Valley leaders get in return ?
Plenty .
Friends in high places can only help when it comes time for their governments to draft regulations about intellectual property , immigration , and permitting , for example .
Actual business deals are few and far between , at least in the short term .
But the meetings can sometimes get the ball rolling .
&quot; There &apos;s a sense that if the rest of the world is doing better , we &apos;ll do better , &quot; Miller , the former Stanford provost , said of the CEO mindset . &quot; It &apos;s not competition but cooperation . Product innovation doesn &apos;t just occur in one place anymore . &quot;
Is there a suicide contagion on Wall Street ?
A few days ago , a Wall Street executive was debating whether he could get away from the office long enough to see his shrink uptown .
In the midst of a busy workday , it was looking unlikely .
Then he stumbled across an article in the New York Post with the disquieting news that a J.P. Morgan Chase ( JPM ) employee had jumped to his death from the bank &apos;s offices in Hong Kong , just three weeks after a fellow banker at the firm had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the bank &apos;s London headquarters .
&quot; JPMorgan suicide is 3rd mysterious death in weeks , &quot; read the Post headline .
The executive went to his appointment .
&quot; He said , &apos; That &apos;s what drove me into your office today , I want to make sure that I &apos;m all right , &apos; &quot; says Alden Cass , the psychologist who treats the executive , as well as a bunch of clients who are portfolio managers , investment bankers , and traders of all types .
The rash of suicides has sent a shudder through Wall Street and beyond .
The third death referenced by the Post — that of a J.P. Morgan executive director who died inside his Connecticut home in January — did not appear to be intentional . ( A report is still pending . )
Yet the J.P. Morgan incidents are only the most recent in a string of at least a half-dozen suicides in the financial world since late August .
Those include executives at Zurich Insurance Group ( ZURVY ) , Deutsche Bank ( DB ) , and Russell Investments , among other firms .
Banker suicides aren &apos;t a new phenomenon .
Clusters of them in quick succession occurred during the Great Depression and during the recent Great Recession .
Indeed , research has shown that suicides can be contagious , so to speak .
That is particularly true when graphic and sensational reports of the fatalities lead to copycats , according to the American Association of Suicidology .
So the recent untimely deaths have sparked concerns that there could be more on the way .
J.P. Morgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti says the company has sent notices reminding employees that 24 / 7 mental health-related support resources are available at the bank , and that its hearts go out to the families of the deceased .
But with each new wave of suicides come questions about whether the deaths signify a disturbing trend : Is finance a potentially deadly occupation ?
That is , do bankers kill themselves more often than other people ?
To find out , Fortune asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to pull the latest suicide statistics from its National Occupational Mortality Surveillance database .
During 1999 , 2003 , 2004 , and 2007 — the most recent years during which research was funded and for which data is available — there were 329 suicides among financial specialists , more than in any other occupation tracked by the CDC except for the broad grouping of &quot; engineers and scientists , &quot; a cohort that lost 502 to suicide .
Finance , however , is a vast profession , and while the total number of finance professionals who commit suicide may be larger than for some other professions , they are actually less likely to do so than , say , lawyers or firefighters .
Take J.P. Morgan as an example : At a bank with more than 260,000 employees around the globe , a pair of suicides may seem shocking and random but the figure is , in fact , well within the range of statistical probability .
Two might even be a low number .
&quot; You would expect that when people work these long hours , &quot; says Alexandra Michel , a former Goldman Sachs ( GS ) investment banker turned management professor at the University of Pennsylvania who for 12 years has been tracking the performance and health of a group of Wall Street recruits at two banks ( she can &apos;t say which ) in an ongoing study . &quot; You would think that it would happen much more often . &quot;
A close examination of the CDC data does reveal a worrisome connection between certain types of financial jobs and an elevated risk of suicide .
The CDC organizes its mortality numbers by census categories , which can be pretty broad .
The Wall Street-oriented classification is &quot; sales representatives for financial and business services &quot; — a category that includes a variety of banking positions , ranging from investment advisers to brokers to traders to investment bankers .
People in that group are 39 % more likely to kill themselves than the workforce as a whole . ( Members of some other white-collar professions are at even greater risk : Lawyers are 54 % more likely than average to commit suicide , and physicians are 97 % more likely . )
Within finance , observers say that investment bankers are often under the most acute mental stress .
&quot; Out of all the sections of finance , no position do I know of that &apos;s more extreme in terms of the emotional endurance one has to have than investment banking , &quot; says Cass , the psychologist who is also the co-author of Bullish Thinking : The Advisor &apos;s Guide to Surviving and Thriving on Wall Street .
It &apos;s a syndrome Michel has also observed while shadowing investment bankers over the years .
After her subjects had worked at a bank for four years on average , she began observing signs of sleeplessness , anxiety , and depression :
&quot; I could see how people came in chatting happily on the phone with friends , how that became less and less , &quot; she says . &quot; People became completely absorbed in the office , in work . Some are feeling trapped . &quot;
J.P. Morgan says the two employees who committed suicide weren &apos;t investment bankers , per se .
According to their LinkedIn ( LNKD ) profiles , Gabriel Magee was a vice president overseeing technology for fixed-income securities in the London office , and Dennis Li was an associate in the billing department supporting the investment bank .
But the high-stakes world of Wall Street has become a more stressful work environment across the board .
The 2008 economic crisis and subsequent recession have exacerbated the problem , says Cass , especially now that the new reality of smaller bonus checks , regular layoffs , and heightened regulation has sunk in .
While those factors have impacted many professions , Cass says , &quot; In investment banking , it becomes a weed-out process — who can take it and who can &apos;t ? &quot;
Cass has noticed the scrutiny weighing on his clients .
The anxiety has trickled down from bosses and pervaded the culture , he says , with bankers kept in a &quot; fear position , &quot; worrying constantly about keeping their jobs — or worse , facing criminal charges .
A CDC analysis of suicides by occupation for 2008 and beyond won &apos;t be ready until 2015 .
But the government agency recently reported an alarming increase in suicides between 1999 and 2010 among Americans old enough to be at the peak of their careers or well-established in the C-suite .
Suicides among 35- to 64-year-olds rose 28 % , with even larger increases among white people ( 40 % ) and those over 50 ( more than 48 % ) .
While it &apos;s not fair , warns Cass , to point blame at any one firm or the industry itself , he sees the increased pressure to avoid mistakes as taking its toll on bankers .
&quot; Obviously it &apos;s good for the collective health of our financial security in the long run , &quot; he says .
For the near term , his clients are keeping their appointments .
The secrets to winning an Academy Award
If the Oscars seem boring and predictable to you this year , then you &apos;re in good company .
Sociologists have considered the Academy Awards predictable for a long time .
A few weeks ago , I spoke with Gabriel Rossman , a UCLA sociologist with some of the most interesting research on the intersection of economics and pop culture .
Rossman has two fascinating papers about the Oscars .
The first addressed the tantalizing question : What qualities of a movie best predict Oscars nominations ?
Unsurprisingly , the biggest correlation was being in a very serious movie .
Considering 172,000 performances listed on IMDB in 20,000 movies , Rossman and co-author Nicole Esparza found that dramas were were nine times more likely to get nominations .
The second and third best predictors both had to do with the size of the competition .
When there are fewer films released around awards season , the odds that any one movie gets a nomination increases .
This simple principle applies , rather unfortunately , to actresses , as well .
It &apos;s an industry truism , borne out in the evidence , that women have fewer meaty roles in the types of movies likely to be nominated for an Oscar .
That means any one dramatic end-of-year performance by a woman has a higher chance of earning a nomination .
Perhaps the most substantive finding in the paper is that people with high IMDB movie rankings in past movie credits were more likely to work with other stars , doubling their chances at getting a nomination .
“ Actors are going to look good when they work with talented people , &quot; Rossman told the Daily Bruin . &quot; This is an interesting thing since you tend to get talented people working with other talented people , meaning that people will end up looking even better than when just working alone . ”
Maybe this seems completely obvious to you : Better actors get better parts and then get to work with better directors ( hello , Leonardo DiCaprio ) .
But it &apos;s also a classic example of what sociologists call cumulative advantage or the &quot; Matthew Effect , &quot; named after the passage in Matthew where Jesus says &quot; For to everyone who has , more will be given and he will grow rich . &quot;
This isn &apos;t as simple as the rich getting richer .
It &apos;s the idea that slightly more talented people get access to higher-quality support for their talents , which greatly multiplies the benefits of their innate advantage ( e.g. : smarter students going to colleges with better professors and better career services connections ) .
The fact that movies with stars get more Oscar attention might be an indication that Hollywood &apos;s stars are simply better than its non-stars .
But probably not .
It &apos;s much more likely a sign that ( just as you might have suspected ) we &apos;re bad picking out discrete instances of talent in star-studded projects .
This would imply we — or , at least , the Academy — is just as bad at recognizing Oscar-worthy talentin movies without any past Oscar nominees .
In both cases , the context overwhelms our ability to recognize individual achievement .
Rossman &apos;s second Oscar paper is about audiences and prizes . Some producers really want to win Oscars .
These producers would also , presumably , like to make money .
The problem is that audiences don &apos;t like most movies that are &quot; Academy Award movies &quot; — here defined as late-year releases about serious subjects ( like AIDS , slavery , or technological dystopia ) — so the business of making an Oscar-y movie is high-risk with dubiously high reward .
Rossman explains it well :
It turns out that audiences dislike movies that are * trying * to get Oscar nominations but really like movies that actually * get * Oscar nominations .
By inference , if there were no Oscars to drive box office towards them , there would be far fewer movies about historical protagonists overcoming oppression .
Indeed , it looks like Hollywood basically nails it since they make exactly the right number of Oscar-targeted movies that the two effects balance out on average .
To the victors go the spoils , kind of .
Best Picture winners can expect a 22 percentraise in box office after a nomination and another 15 percent bump if they win , according to IBISWorld .
But the financial calculations probably miss the best reasons to try to make an Oscar movie : To win accolades within the industry , to win access to stars who can make you more money down the line and , just maybe , to bask in the honor of making a truly great film .
Screens put years on you : &apos; Computer face &apos; is giving women jowls and lines
A growing number of women are developing something called &apos; computer face &apos; , a leading cosmetic surgeon said .
Dr Michael Prager said professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls , &apos; turkey neck &apos; and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes .
The Botox specialist said that , of all his clientele , office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing .
&apos;If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown or squint while they are concentrating at the screen then , over time , you will inevitably end up with frown lines , &apos; Dr Prager , 42 , said .
&apos;What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long .
&apos;If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy , eventually giving you a second neck .
&apos;We are seeing a lot of women who work in executive jobs in offices who have this problem . &apos; Dr Prager , who has a practice near Harley Street in London , said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen .
&apos;When people are stressed or thinking hard about something then they will often put on a &quot; grumpy face &quot; without even knowing what they are doing . When my clients put a mirror next to their desk they are often shocked by the angry , frowning face which stares back at them.&apos;
He warned that a generation of younger men and women who had grown up with information technology were developing &apos; computer face &apos; at a much earlier age .
He said : &apos; The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so . But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task .
&apos;It will be completely different for them and I think the problem is going to become much , much worse . In another ten years , they could be looking quite awful.&apos;
Dr Prager said there were several simple steps which could stave off computer face such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles .
And , of course , there was always Botox .
He said that , after a couple of sessions of Botox , the habit of &apos; grumpy face &apos; could be broken .

What singles really what
A recent online commercial tells the following story : upon graduating , getting a job and being promoted , the female protagonist ’ s grandmother , whose health is in decline , keeps asking her the same question , “ When are you getting married ? ” , until the woman finally rushes home in a wedding dress to bring the elderly lady in her dying days the ultimate comfort .
Marriage puts a lot of pressure on single women , as if they are destined to get married in order to fulfill others ’ , rather than their own , expectations .
But what ’ s pushing single women into matrimony is a social stereotype and form of self-identification that creates a dilemma for modern women in today ’ s social contexts , experts say .
In the book Seeking Happily Ever After : Navigating the Ups and Downs of Being Single Without Losing Your Mind ( and Finding Lasting Love Along the Way ) , US author Michelle Cove tries to reveal what women really want out of a relationship .
As reported in Marie Claire , a women ’ s magazine in the US , Cove identifies some of the categories of single women based on intensive interviews .
The Soul-Mate Seeker
Finding “ The One ” is the most important task in her life .
The Phoenix
She is doing everything she can to rise from a recent devastating breakup and to be in good shape again .
The Organic
She prefers the “ let it be ” approach and leaves things up to destiny .
She lives her own life rather than hunting for men in a methodical way .
The Free Spirit
Independence or a relationship ?
She believes there is no way to reach a compromise between both and therefore leans to the former .
The Wedding Wisher
She suddenly finds herself fantasizing about getting married after a lifetime of not caring about it .
The Town Rebel
She no longer aspires to live the normal lifestyle of everyone else in her community , though she once used to .
The Slow and Steady
A woman who hopes to marry when the time is right .
Meanwhile , she does her best not to cave to the massive pressure she feels from friends , family and society .
The Trailblazer
A woman who knows married life is not for her , so she ’ s trying to break a new kind of path to happiness .
Welcome to As It Is from VOA Learning English ! I &apos;m Mario Ritter in Washington .
Today we turn to South Asia and the issue of public health .
Vaccination efforts have almost ended the risk of polio infection in most countries .
But the World Health Organization says the virus is still a problem in a major Pakistani city .
The World Health Organization has declared the Pakistani city of Peshawar , the world &apos;s &quot; largest reservoir &quot; of endemic poliovirus .
And WHO officials fear Pakistanis could face travel restrictions unless steps are taken immediately to stop the disease from spreading.Christopher Cruise has more .
Researchers studied all the cases of poliomyelitis in Pakistan last year .
The researchers found that almost every case could be linked genetically to the poliovirus often reported in Peshawar .
They added that all test samples collected from different parts of the city have shown the presence of the highly infectious virus .
Polio mainly affects children under five years of age . The virus is passed through food or water .
The virus reproduces in the body , and later invades the nervous system .
The disease can sometimes lead to paralysis , with loss of muscle control in part of the body .
The WHO study found that 90 percent of Pakistan &apos;s polio cases could be linked to the virus in Peshawar .
In addition , 12 of the 13 polio cases in Afghanistan were also linked to the city .
Elias Durry serves as the WHO &apos;s emergency coordinator for polio in Pakistan .
He says local officials need to take urgent action to strengthen vaccination campaigns .
He says the situation in Peshawar not only threatens the gains Pakistan has made against polio ,
but could also harm international efforts to stop the disease .
&quot; Unless the polio eradication program in Pakistan is able to curtail the transmission in Peshawar ,
the expansion of , of the viruses to other places will not stop ,
so it is critical that Peshawar , the way it is behaving now , really be able to find ways of interrupting these transmissions that have been consistent throughout the years . &quot;
He also noted an increase in deadly attacks on vaccination campaign workers in and around Peshawar , and in other areas .
Taliban militants often attack polio workers in Pakistan .
The militants accuse them of being American spies or part of a plot to keep Muslims from having babies .
Most of the attacks have taken place in Peshawar because the city is close to the country &apos;s tribal districts .
Extremist groups have bases in those areas .
Elias Durry did not reject the possibility of other countries ordering travel and visa restrictions on Pakistan if there is no quick improvement in the situation .
In neighboring India , no polio cases have been reported for the past three years .
Starting this month , all visitors to India from Pakistan are required to show a record of their polio vaccination.I &apos;m Christopher Cruise .

Police in Guizhou province say they have established a motive for Thursday &apos;s deadly bus arson that killed six people .
They say the suspect , surnamed Su , believed his wife was having an affair ,
and thus he &quot; took revenge on society &quot; by igniting a barrel of gasoline on the bus .
A four month old boy is among the six people killed .
35 others were injured .
Survivors say the flames spread quickly .
The suspect was slightly injured in the fire - he was formally arrested on Friday .
The Chinese government has taken a major step to improve the competitiveness of the nation &apos;s oil and gas exploration sector .
A variety of equipment vital to the industry has been added to China &apos;s duty-free list ,
including drilling equipment , semi-submersible drilling rigs , liquified natural gas carriers ,
and several other pieces vital to exploration and high-end manufactoring .
The measure takes effect on Saturday .
You &apos;re only a day away from Friday .
You &apos;re watching CNN STUDENT NEWS .
You &apos;re ten minutes away from getting up to speed on current events .
We are starting in China today .
Big meeting there .
It &apos;s the once a year gathering of the National People &apos;s Congress .
It includes thousands of delegates from all over the country .
China is a communist state .
The government controls the economy and other parts of society .
It won &apos;t be voting on any major laws .
But this meeting is a chance for China to talk about its economic plans .
And because it &apos;s the world &apos;s second largest economy , international economists are watching to see what China will do .
Other parts of the international community are watching Ukraine .
A lot of talking about the crisis there yesterday .
Meetings involving officials from the European Union , Ukraine , Russia , the U.S. , but there wasn &apos;t a lot of action .
Some U.S. officials are still considering economic sanctions against Russian for its involvement in Ukraine .
Russia &apos;s threatening economic action of its own that could hurt trade in other parts of Europe .
You didn &apos;t see it , you didn &apos;t feel it .
You might not have known it was there .
But an asteroid zipped by us yesterday .
Well , that &apos;s relative .
It was close by space standards , it wasn &apos;t in terms of miles .
But since there is a one in 10,000 chance of this same asteroid coming back near us , on March 4 , 2046 , Chad Myers is going to help us get to know it .
Chad .
Hey , Carl , an asteroid yesterday flew between the Earth and the Moon , or at least the orbit of the Moon .
It &apos;s about a quarter of a million miles between the Earth to the Moon .
And this was slightly inside of it .
90 percent , all the way from here to here , or ten percent from here to here .
So , it was still about 217,000 miles away as it flew on by the Earth .
Now , let &apos;s think about the size of this .
Because here &apos;s the baseball diamond right here .
Here &apos;s actually the tournament field .
If you take a ball of-a big rock and you put it right over the infield , that &apos;s how big this asteroid was .
Right over the infield of any baseball diamond .
Now , you take that , you fly that in between the Earth and the Moon .
And you have something going for it .
Now , this is not one of the closer ones probably will have this year .
But it certainly is 90 percent of the way between the Earth and the Moon , and it &apos;s called DX-110 .
110 because it &apos;s actually the hundred and tenth asteroid that they have found so far this year .
Dental X-rays
Little and not often , please
Confirmation that dental X-rays can be bad for you
If you are a suspicious type you may be disturbed by the fact that , despite reassurances of the safety of the procedure , dentists and their technicians , when administering X-rays , usually step out of the room while the deed is done .
Not only that , they often drape a lead-lined apron over your body to protect your vital organs . Well , all but one : your brain .
A study by Elizabeth Claus , of Yale University , just published in Cancer , suggests your suspicions might be justified .
Dr Claus thinks she has identified , in those who have had dental X-rays often , a significant rise in the admittedly small risk of developing a brain tumour .
In rich countries , five men in every 200,000 , and twice as many women , develop tumours called meningiomas that affect the membranes surrounding the brain .
Meningiomas account for a third of primary brain tumours .
Only about 2 % of them are malignant , but non-malignant does not mean non-dangerous .
Even a benign meningioma can kill .
Around 30 % do so within five years of diagnosis .
Symptoms can include seizures and blindness , and treatment may involve surgery , chemotherapy or , ironically , radiotherapy .
Ironically , because past research studying the after-effects of exposure to things like atom bombs and radiation treatments for cancer suggests the most important environmental risk factor for meningiomas is ionising radiation .
These days , however , the main source of ionising radiation for most people is neither fallout from bombs nor radiotherapy ; it is dental X-rays .
Despite that , surprisingly little research has been done on those X-rays &apos; effects .
Dr Claus and her colleagues have tried to plug the gap .
They studied 1,433 Americans who have had meningiomas and compared them with 1,350 others who have not .
These others were chosen to match the study group &apos;s age profile , sex ratio and dwelling place .
The researchers then inquired about both groups &apos; family , medical and dental histories .
In the case of their dental histories , participants were asked whether they generally had standard X-rays , known as bitewings , every year , or never had them , or fell somewhere in between .
They were also asked how often they had had panoramic X-rays — so-called panorexes — taken of their entire mouths , and whether they had ever had braces , the fitting of which often involves a panoramic X-ray .
The researchers found that people who had had a meningioma were more than twice as likely as those who had not to have had at least one bitewing X-ray .
And the more bitewings they had been given , the greater that likelihood was .
Even more troubling was the finding that people who had been given a panorex when they were under ten had 4.9 times the normal risk of developing a meningioma .
To be fair , only 22 participants in the study had both had a panorex and developed such a tumour .
But according to Dr Claus , the panorex was not common when most of the people in the study had been children .
Nowadays , she says , before getting braces all the kids have it .
What these results mean in practice is debatable .
The radiation dose from an individual dental X-ray , Dr Claus points out , has gone down by about half over the past 30 years or so .
In addition , some dentists and orthodontists — though far from the majority — have turned to digital methods that expose patients to even lower levels . But others are using fancy new techniques like cone-beam computerised tomography which actually expose people to much higher levels of radiation .
Moreover , guidelines from the American Dental Association state that healthy adults should have a bitewing X-ray no more than once every two or three years , and that there is little reason to X-ray patients who do not have symptoms .
These are policies which Dr Claus describes as quite reasonable .
But if what her participants told her is true , not all dentists are heeding their own professional body &apos;s advice .
Most of those who took part in the study reported having at least one X-ray a year .
Dr Claus &apos;s work , then , is a timely reminder that X-rays are dangerous , that dentists should use them sparingly and that patients who have suspicions about their use are not necessarily paranoid .
A flat world sounds like something from the dark ages .
Indeed , a world of flat oil prices could , for some , be a very unpleasant place .
The lack of upward movement has already had an impact on the behaviour of major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Kuwait , UAE , Oman and Bahrain .
These nations have slowed the pace of budgetary expansion from a regional average of 14 per cent growth last year to less than 3 per cent this year .
A report from Moody &apos;s calculates the Brent crude oil price required to generate the revenue needed to cover spending plans ( the break-even price ) .
Since 2008 spending has more than kept pace with a doubling oil price .
And those spending plans are still rising , even if the oil price is not .
The UN forecasts that the labour force in the region will grow at 10 per cent annually until 2020 .
Investment in job creation is crucial .
Significant spending cuts will be hard to push through .
For example , the break-even price for Oman is $ 100 ; for Bahrain it is $ 130 . Oil is trading at $ 109 .
Should oil prices and regional government revenues suddenly drop , most of the Gulf nations can fall back on their sovereign wealth funds .
Its SWF amounts to just two years of spending .
In Bahrain oil accounts for only a quarter of its GDP but it is 87 per cent of revenues .
It is the only Gulf economy running a budget deficit , as Bank of America points out .
Since 2008 its debt to GDP ratio has more than doubled , to 61 per cent .
For now , oil is firm .
MSCI &apos;s index of Gulf country stock exchanges has risen by a tenth this year , partly on inflows into Qatar and UAE before their entry into MSCIﾒs Emerging Markets Index .
Credit default swaps on Bahrain , a potential warning indicator , have pulled back since October , suggesting credit markets are unconcerned . But if the world stays flat , the pressure will rise .
BP splits off US energy unit
BP is creating a new business to manage its US onshore oil and gas assets , in an effort to compete more effectively with the smaller independent companies that dominate America ’ s shale industry .
Analysts said BP could ultimately sell the new unit if its performance did not improve .
Last year , the oil group said it planned to divest $ 10bn of assets by the end of next year – on top of the $ 38bn disposal programme implemented in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 .
Bob Dudley , BP ’ s chief executive , played down the possibility of a sale , saying that the new US business “ will remain a critical part of BP ’ s portfolio over the long term ” .
However , he added that the move “ creates optionality for us ” .
BP will own the US unit , but it will operate separately from the rest of the company , be led by a separate management team and publish separate financials from 2015 .
BP ’ s plan reflects the difficulties that oil majors including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell have had in trying to make money from US shale gas .
All have been hit by the driving down of US natural gas prices caused by the shale boom .
War fears decimate Russia stocks
Fears of a war in Ukraine wiped a 10th off the value of Moscow ’ s stock exchange and sent the rouble tumbling to an all-time low as the west scrambled to counter Russia ’ s creeping invasion of Crimea .
Investors fled Russian assets , with stocks in Moscow falling by 10.8 per cent , their biggest daily fall since the 2008 financial crisis .
Global markets also reacted to the prospect of a conflict and there was a jump in the price of commodities that are heavily dependent on Russia and Ukraine , such as wheat , oil and European natural gas .
The rouble , already one of the worse performing currencies , fell nearly 3 per cent to a record low of Rbs36.90 against the dollar before the central bank surprised the market by raising rates and spending at least $ 7bn propping up the rouble .
The market turmoil came as tensions continued to rise over Russia ’ s occupation of Crimea .
Ukraine ’ s defence ministry said its forces in Crimea had received an ultimatum from Russian forces to surrender to them by 5am local time today or face attack .
Russia dismissed the claims as “ utter nonsense ” .
The near 11 per cent slide in the rouble so far this year has raised fears of inflation in Russia , where people have painful memories of devaluations in 1997-98 and 2008-09 .
Economists said the combination of higher inflation , rising interest rates and capital flight could tip the struggling Russian economy into recession .
“ This is a security shock which will push Russia into a mild recession , ” Jacob Nell , chief Russia economist at Morgan Stanley .
The impact rippled across global stock markets .
Equities tumbled as investors fled to safer assets such as government bonds .
The FTSE All-World share index fell 1.4 per cent – reversing last week ’ s gains and by lunchtime in New York , the S &amp; P 500 was down 1 per cent .
Wheat leapt 4.7 per cent , Brent crude oil rose 2.1 per cent and UK natural gas futures jumped by nearly 10 per cent .
The cost of insuring Ukrainian and Russian debt against a default jumped by 15 per cent .
Cooper Tire takes $ 29m hit from Chinese strikes
Chinese industrial action cost Cooper Tire $ 29m in the three months to September 30 , the Ohio-based company reported , shedding rare light on the economic impact of a labour dispute in China .
While strikes are common across China , they typically occur at little-known suppliers .
On those rare occasions when labour unrest disrupts operations at a large multinational , the impact on a global company ’ s overall operations is usually not material enough to force disclosure about a specific strike ’ s financial cost .
The seven-month industrial action at Cooper ’ s joint venture Chengshan Tire factory in Shandong province derailed a $ 2.4bn bid by Apollo Tyres for Cooper , in what would have been the largest Indian takeover of a US company .
It also occurred at a facility that generates as much as one quarter of Cooper ’ s revenue and profit .
In a delayed third-quarter earnings report , Cooper said the strike had cost it $ 22m in reduced production and a further $ 7m in “ manufacturing inefficiencies ” .
The company incurred a further $ 5m in expenses related to the failed transaction during the quarter .
The losses in Shandong contributed to a 25 per cent year-on-year fall in third-quarter sales , to $ 832m .
Operating profit contracted almost 80 per cent compared with 2012 , to $ 28m .
Cooper reported a net loss of $ 168,000 for the July-September period , compared with a net profit of $ 74m a year earlier .
Management and the workforce at Chengshan had opposed the proposed takeover by Apollo , arguing that it would saddle Cooper with too much debt .
The campaign for Scottish Independence suffered a setback yesterday when two of the country ’ s biggest employers warned on the risks of a Yes vote , in a sign that companies are ready to break their silence on the issue .
Standard Life , the insurance company that employs 5,000 people north of the border , said constitutional changes could prompt it to shift large parts of operations out of Scotland in the most significant intervention by a big company .
Royal Bank of Scotland , which has 12,000 staff in the country , also warned a vote for independence could damage its credit rating , although its chief executive insisted the group would remain “ neutral ” on the outcome of the referendum .
Until now few companies have been willing to enter the independence debate for fear of upsetting customers and staff .
However , if opinion polls continue to show nationalists narrowing the gap ahead of the vote in September then groups worried about the implications are more likely to speak out .
Standard Life , which has been based in Scotland since 1825 , has started to register new entities in England , which would smooth any move south .
The future of the currency is its biggest concern , say people familiar with the matter .
The Royal Bank of Scotland said in its annual report : “ A vote in favour of Scottish independence would be likely to significantly impact the group ’ s credit ratings . ”
Second in size only to the City of London , the Scottish financial and professional services industry supports 150,000 jobs and accounts for nearly 13 per cent of the Scottish economy , says lobby group TheCityUK .
China denies direct role in renminbi ’ s decline
The renminbi has suffered its steepest weekly fall against the US dollar since China reformed its exchange rate system in 2005 in a move that some economists have interpreted as a warning from the country ’ s central bank to currency speculators .
The renminbi posted its seventh straight daily decline yesterday , sliding 0.02 per cent against the dollar to close at 6.1244 having hit its lowest level since early August in intraday trading .
One popular theory among economists and investors is that the People ’ s Bank of China engineered the depreciation because it was concerned about huge inflows of capital in recent months and wanted to show markets that trading the currency was not a one-way bet .
Analysts had been forecasting a continuation of the appreciation seen since late 2012 .
However , the Chinese central bank used its first official statement on the sudden weakening of the country ’ s currency to say the sell-off was a reflection of market forces and should not be over-interpreted .
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange , an agency under the central bank , did not acknowledge any role in guiding the currency .
“ The recent movement of the renminbi exchange rate is the result of market players adjusting their near-term trading strategies , ” it said .
“ The degree of exchange rate volatility is normal by the standards of developed and emerging markets . ”
After huge investment and trade inflows at the start of the year , there was a clear reversal of the trend in February , according to China Financial News , a central bank newspaper .
“ Risk appetite has weakened somewhat because of lower-than-expected growth data . Also , concerns about the property market have increased , ” said Peng Wensheng , an economist with China International Capital Corp , the research group .
However , the hand of the ­ Chinese central bank , which keeps a tight grip on the exchange rate , has been evident .
When the currency started falling last week it was the central bank that steadily lowered its daily reference rate , while banks and companies continued to trade it at a stronger level .
It was only over the past two days that the market-traded exchange rate fell below the daily rate set by the central bank – a sign that Beijing has , for now , succeeded in breaking at least some of the one-way bets on appreciation .
China faced immense capital inflows at the start of this year , according to data published on Tuesday by the central bank .
Banks bought a net $ 73bn of foreign currency in the onshore market from their clients who wanted renminbi in January , the biggest monthly amount on record .
Inflows have been accelerating since the middle of last year when China ’ s mountain of foreign exchange reserves grew by $ 500bn to $ 3.8tn.
Beijing faces up to failure in Xinjiang
The dramatic failure of China ’ s containment strategy for a long-running insurgency in the remote northwestern region of Xinjiang poses a grave policy challenge for Beijing .
The conflict , involving Muslim Uighurs who object to Chinese control of their energy-rich homeland , burst into the country ’ s heartland in a terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 33 people in the southwestern city of Kunming on Saturday night .
The deadly assault by machete-wielding assailants , who struck at the city ’ s main railway station , also raises questions about whether the Chinese government ’ s hardline response to Uighur “ separatism ” has succeeded only in creating a more intractable crisis .
Last night the official Xinhua news agency said Chinese police had arrested three people involved in the attack and identified the group ’ s leader as Abdurehim Kurban .
Authorities killed another four suspects and apprehended a fifth at the railway station on Saturday .
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Beijing has always maintained its conflict in Xinjiang is with unspecified “ separatist ” elements rather than with “ Uighur ” activists .
The distinction is important because it suggests that external or hostile forces – rather than the government ’ s own policies – are to blame for tensions in strategically important regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet .
More than 100 people were killed in clashes in Xinjiang last year , mostly in remote areas where conflicting accounts of the incidents could not be independently checked .
The massacre in Kunming is the second time the conflict has spilled beyond Xinjiang ’ s borders since October , when three Uighurs drove a vehicle into a crowd in Tiananmen Square .
Although a highly symbolic attack at the centre of China ’ s capital , it killed only two bystanders .
Saturday ’ s mass killing , by contrast , was shocking for both its location and its death toll .
In Kunming yesterday clear blue skies and blooming flowers added to the sense of disbelief at what had occurred less than 48 hours earlier .
“ The number of casualties and the impact of the violence are unprecedentedly high , ” said Li Wei , an antiterrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations .
“ The terrorist threat is clearly moving beyond Xinjiang . The attack was carefully organised and planned . The people involved had been well trained . ”
The savage nature of what some state media have called “ China ’ s 9 / 11 ” was on graphic display on the ninth floor of the Number one Kunming People ’ s Hospital , where victims of the terror attack are recovering .
Most of the wounded were slashed in the head , their shaven scalps now criss-crossed with long scars and stitches .
Cao Nian described the moment when his 23-year-old girlfriend , Wang Hongli , was struck in the back of the head .
“ I was seeing her off at the station when &#91; the attackers &#93; appeared , ” he said .
“ First there was one , then six . We were crouching down when they hit her . ” The two staggered out of the station , running some 400 metres to find medical help .
Mr Cao , who was not injured in the attack , spoke as another casualty was wheeled by his sleeping girlfriend .
A deep scar cut across the right side of the victim ’ s head , which had been stitched .
A pool of blood was still evident in his ear .
“ We are all appalled by this tragedy , ” said Na Zhouhuai , a Muslim trader from China ’ s Hui ethnic group , as he waited for midday prayers to begin at the Shuncheng mosque .
“ They killed ordinary people – ordinary people like us here . We believe that you should not even kill an ant . ”
There was no police presence outside Mr Na ’ s mosque and surprisingly modest security at Kunming ’ s railway station , which was again crowded with travellers .
A banner outside the Shuncheng mosque in Kunming ’ s city centre urges worshippers to “ strengthen ethnic relations and unity , construct a harmonious society ” .
While a large number of police vans were parked near Dashuying , a mixed Uighur and Hui neighbourhood , officers were not visible on the streets .
“ People are scared and business is down , ” one restaurant owner said . “ They rounded up some Uighurs here on Sunday . ”
The detentions could not be confirmed .
Elsewhere , however , there were signs of a possible backlash brewing on the eve of the annual two-week session of China ’ s national parliament .
Li Fangping , a human rights lawyer representing a prominent Uighur scholar charged on Wednesday last week with separatist offences , posted on his blog a copy of a police notice from Nanning , another city in China ’ s southwest , asking local residents to report the arrival of any Uighur residents , businessmen or tourists in the area .
Nanning police declined to comment on the notice .
“ This is a reaction to the central government ’ s top-down demand for stability . It ’ s their usual way of doing things , ” said Mr Li .
“ It ’ s an illegal and exaggerated response that won ’ t solve the crisis and will just make things worse . ”
Big Brother can watch me at work any day
Last week the Financial Times published a scary story about how technology is being used by companies to spy on us at work .
It described how sensors can be easily and cheaply hidden in name badges and office furniture to track where we are , who we talk to and in what tone of voice .
HR departments can find out how long we take to get to work and how we behave when we get there .
In shops , call centres and even boardrooms , the data could be used to decide who to promote and who to fire .
I shuddered as I read the article – as did most FT readers .
Nineteen Eighty-Four is upon us , they commented online .
Totalitarianism is rampant ! Privacy is down the plughole !
( Some of the comments are published in “ Feedback ” below ) .
Yet on closer inspection , the arrival of Big Brother in the corporate world is not necessarily such a bad thing .
Being constantly monitored by invisible devices might sound frightening but I ’ m not sure it is any more so than being monitored infrequently by visible human beings .
Under the present arrangement , we are observed in a haphazard and unscientific way by superiors who may well have made up their minds about us already , based on not much evidence at all .
Sod ’ s Law decrees that when you do something good , no one notices but the minute you do something bad you get caught .
I remember one boss who , once in a blue moon , would walk around the office ; whenever he crept up behind me I was invariably writing a shopping list or was on the phone to my mum .
Such surveillance didn ’ t improve my behaviour , though it did increase my sense of injustice .
To have been monitored all the time – which would have put the shopping list in the context of otherwise diligent behaviour – would have been a vast improvement .
In most offices a raft of mainly pointless , cumbersome tools are used to assess performance , including “ competency matrices ” , appraisal interviews and psychometric testing .
Together they are so ineffective that according to a delightful piece of research by the University of Catania , companies would be no worse off promoting people at random .
If we are in favour of meritocracies , we should also be in favour of anything that helps us measure merit more accurately .
While the data collected by the new sensors are almost certainly too crude to offer much help now , I see no reason why in time ( and probably quite soon ) we will not have worked out exactly which behavioural quirks are the key to high ( or low ) performance , and found a decent , objective way of measuring them .
Steelcase , which makes some of the sensors so loathed by FT readers , hopes that one day they will not only be used to monitor juniors but in boardrooms too .
While it is hard to see directors willingly turning these tools upon themselves , it would be a terrific idea if they did .
At the moment , monitoring of boardroom behaviour is hopeless – outsiders periodically come in to observe , but such are the political sensitivities it is almost impossible for them to make a difference .
If , by contrast , all directors were wired up , anyone who banged on indefinitely , lowering the pulses of their boardroom colleagues , would be faithfully fingered by the technology .
Equally , the person who made the odd remark that made everyone sit up in their seats would also be marked out .
Knowing that the devices were there , and knowing the object of the exercise was to make incisive , controversial points , would improve board meetings no end .
It is objected that monitoring behaviour in offices would kill trust and spontaneity , making robots of us all .
But so long as everyone knew they were being monitored and understood what for , I don ’ t see why it should be such a terrifying idea – except perhaps for those who bully , shout at and harass others – and who have been getting away with it .
Far from making work less civilised , the arrival of Big Brother could make it more so .
Office life could become more transparent and less political .
And managers would be freed from having to play the role of policeman all day and allowed to get on with the more important role of helping people do a better job .
Some problems would need resolving .
For a start extensive monitoring could be illegal .
You would also have to ensure that workers were not able to subvert the process – and that wicked managers were not busily manipulating the data for their own devious ends .
Above all , for the system to work , you would need to have some faith in the regime that implemented it .
But then , if you don ’ t have any faith in the regime , the chances are that you are screwed anyway .
New steel plants cast doubt on China ’ s emission control plan
Steel plant closures central to the Chinese government ’ s plan for cutting pollution are likely to be outpaced by steel mills under construction , casting doubt on Beijing ’ s ability to make headway against air pollution enveloping northern China .
On Wednesday , Beijing was again gripped by the thick grey pall that has lingered over northern China for more than a week .
Public anger over air pollution has spurred the government to speed up the release of air monitoring data , and could strengthen the hand of environmental regulators in shutting down powerful polluters .
About 30m tonnes of new steel capacity across the country is still under construction , double the 15m tonnes of cuts pledged for 2014 by Hebei province , the industrial heartland surrounding Beijing which accounts for about a quarter of Chinese steel capacity .
Hebei agreed to the cuts as part of a national plan to reduce polluting emissions in the North China plain , where pollution regularly exceeds national standards .
State media showed footage of steel mills and cement plants being destroyed to underline the government ’ s resolve .
About 8m tonnes of capacity have been permanently closed down in Hebei since the plan was announced .
But so far , it is the least powerful polluters that have taken it on the chin .
“ Generally speaking , the mills that have closed are older and unprofitable , ” Wang Jiguang , a sales director at Hebei Iron and Steel Group , one of China ’ s largest steel producers , said at an iron ore conference organised by Metal Bulletin in Beijing .
Most of them have actually been idle for six months to a year already due to economic reasons .
Hebei pledged to cut its steel capacity by 60m tonnes by 2017 , as part of a negotiated deal to reduce emissions in northern China , the Yangtze Delta and the Pearl River Delta while encouraging industrial investment in the arid west .
Meanwhile , the central government set up a $ 1.6bn fund to reward industry that complies with emission cuts , in recognition of the local jobs and taxes generated by polluting companies .
It is expected to transfer about $ 330m to Hebei province , which is also the source of most of Beijing ’ s power supply .
Past attempts by central planning agencies to reduce industrial capacity by fiat have similarly ended in tears , as plant bosses and the banks that lend to them almost always chose to expand rather than face closure .
Allowing the market to cull the inefficient producers has proved even more difficult in China , as state-owned steel companies are generally the worst performers .
Nearly every inland steel producer with more than 5m tonnes of capacity – in other words , at least a dozen of China ’ s biggest and most politically powerful mills – are losing money , according to industry expert Xu Zhongbo of Beijing Metal Consulting Ltd , with the exception of mills that have invested in automotive steel .
Policies directly tied to reducing pollution rather than cutting industrial capacity have generally been more effective .
For instance , about a decade ago China ordered the phase-out of the heavily polluting Soderberg process at aluminium smelters , and smelters were duly upgraded .
Power plants across China have installed emissions scrubbers , and have become more willing to use them in recent years after power subsidies were tweaked to reward their operation .
China ’ s mobile sector grows up superfast
The bustling shopping streets of Shanghai drive home the image of a country glued to mobile devices , often at the expense of passers-by shouldered out of the way by workers hurrying past with smartphone in hand .
The Chinese telecoms market was equally as urgent for the 75,000 people who descended on a bustling Barcelona last week for the industry ’ s biggest annual conference .
While Europeans and Americans have had superfast 4G services for several years , the close to a billion people signed up to China Mobile , the world ’ s largest mobile carrier , are only now being given their first sight of so-called 4G or LTE technology .
But such is the scale and speed at which China ’ s telecoms industry moves , driven by state policy , that there are already more 4G mobile masts installed in China than in the whole of Europe .
This gap will widen with a further wave of large tenders expected by the leading equipment makers in the next few months .
China ’ s adoption of 4G is not just a story about bringing faster internet speeds to the most populous nation .
The type of 4G technology – a standard called TD-LTE – used by China Mobile and its rivals means there are wide-ranging ramifications for device makers such as Apple and Samsung and telecoms equipment makers such as Ericsson and Nokia .
Not to mention homegrown technology champions such as Huawei , which is benefiting more than most from the country ’ s telecoms boom .
“ The telecoms industry has been the poster child of the Chinese economic boom . A global standard based on a Chinese design is a prestige thing , and also an economic boon to the Chinese telecoms vendors , ” says Tom Mowat , lead analyst for Analysys Mason ’ s Asia-Pacific team .
Need for speed
4G technology is capable of delivering the internet over mobile phones almost instantly , opening up a host of services and applications as well as a vast market for western technology groups such as Apple , which will finally be able to sell its iPhones to China Mobile ’ s 750m customers .
“ By 2016 , we estimate that China Mobile will be used for one in ten handsets globally , ” says Mr Mowat .
The rapid adoption of superfast internet technology underscores the country ’ s economic and social development .
While Chinese companies were previously seen as cheap imitators of western groups , the introduction of superfast networks has meant new web-orientated businesses such as WeChat and Alibaba are already competing with Silicon Valley rivals .
This is not the first time China has sought to take a lead with its telecoms networks .
The battle for the 3G market has been fought with unblinking perseverance between GSM and CDMA standards over the past decade .
China Mobile , which favoured the TD-CDMA standard , lost . Most global networks now conform to GSM .
This is why there was no iPhone on China Mobile ’ s network for so many years and why visitors to the Beijing Olympics complained about the poor mobile service at such an important event .
“ The government had to force it down the throat of China Mobile and even then the company could not really make it work , ” says Duncan Clark , chairman of BDA , an inward investment group .
With 4G , China ’ s TD standard is not necessarily a competing technology to the more common FDD-LTE technology , since both can coexist in handsets .
Equipment makers will not be forced to choose between competing technologies – and as such will give the TD standards a far higher chance of success .
The Chinese market is also more mature now , and the sheer scale of the rollout this time involving all three of the country ’ s telecoms groups means there is a much higher chance of putting the TD technology at the heart of the global telecoms market .
Standards battle
The scale of the 4G programme gives the adopted standard momentum – and China the opportunity to take the lead in the next generation of global broadband technology .
In a growing battle over future technology standards , analysts say China is sponsoring the less popular form of technology through widespread domestic take-up .
There are only about 17 TD-LTE mobile networks commercially available worldwide – or one in 40 LTE connections globally .
“ The world ’ s largest operator running this sort of network immediately turns &#91; TD-LTE &#93; into a very successful global standard , ” says Mr Mowat .
Division of the spoils
There are some ironies in China ’ s bold ambitions for the introduction of superfast mobile broadband , given the internet can be incredibly slow because of the “ Great Firewall ” that blocks or filters foreign sites .
But the speed of the rollout needs to be seen in the context of a telecoms industry largely controlled by the state .
“ China Mobile has $ 65bn on its balance sheet so it can afford to build out very quickly . The government sees its balance sheet as a useful tool , ” says Tucker Grinnan , regional head of telecoms for HSBC in Asia .
Much of the work to build the 4G network has been won by Chinese groups such as Huawei and ZTE , which deny direct links to the state .
Western groups such as Ericsson , NSN and Alcatel-Lucent have won sizeable contracts , but some of their executives have expressed dissatisfaction about China Mobile awarding all three western manufacturers a seemingly arbitrary 11 per cent each of its Rmb20bn ( $ 3.25bn ) 4G contract .
Beyond 4G
Chinese technology groups are not stopping at 4G in the race for industry leadership , with Huawei committing significant resources to the next generation of so-called “ 5G ” technology .
CCS Insight , a UK-based research group , predicts China will become the leader in next-generation mobile technology in the next two years , leaving behind a Europe where authorities are belatedly pushing the industry to invest “ to regain former glory ” .
Huawei said that by 2018 it would invest at least $ 600m in research into 5G technology capable of speeds more than 100 times faster than 4G .
That investment is far more than has been claimed by any western rival .
Indeed , this has now become a battle of regional interests to seek an edge in next-generation technology .
The march towards superfast mobile internet in China has been speeded by government efforts and the desire to create a market to benefit its technology champions .
China consumers will enjoy world-class network quality , with resulting benefits to the internet groups already growing rapidly in the country , though censors will probably continue keeping a close tab on content .
The US is currently negotiating major trade agreements across the Atlantic and Pacific .
Both deals are historic in scope , offering us a chance to shape the global economy in ways that strengthen US leadership in the world and the American middle class at home .
Many in Congress and in my own party view new trade agreements sceptically and are reluctant to offer their support .
I understand the pressures these lawmakers face .
But I am convinced that the two deals we are negotiating are in America ’ s best interest , and that politicians will ultimately be rewarded for making them happen .
That is why President Barack Obama and I are committed to seeing them through .
The global economy is at an inflection point .
The choices we make now will determine our role in the world for decades to come .
We have an opportunity to shape the path of global commerce to spread our values and benefit our people , and we should seize it .
The US has been the world ’ s pre-eminent economic power for many years and will remain so for the foreseeable future .
But the rise of new economic powers means we will face fierce competition from more places than ever before .
America ’ s economic relations with the rest of the world matter more now than ever before .
Countries that throw up protectionist barriers and distort their economies to favour state-owned enterprises are challenging rules of the road that we have relied on for decades .
The question is whether the US will take a leadership role in shaping a new course that reflects American values – or whether we will stand on the sidelines as a new order unfolds .
The two agreements now in the works would place the US at the centre of two vast trading regions .
The Trans-Pacific Partnership would connect America to economies as diverse as Japan , Malaysia and Chile .
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership would significantly deepen what is already a multitrillion-dollar economic relationship with the EU .
Together they would unite nearly two-thirds of the world economy in support of open and fair economic competition .
Both of the deals will increase US exports and help attract good middle-class jobs to America .
When 95 per cent of the world ’ s customers live beyond our borders , exports are critical .
Outside studies have found that the TPP and TTIP would each increase exports by more than $ 120bn a year .
Some 44m Americans work for companies that export goods .
Jobs supported by exports pay as much as 18 per cent higher than the national average .
After decades when our economy grew but the middle class took a beating , Americans are understandably worried about rising inequality at home .
The president and I are determined to address this .
So the deals we are negotiating are different from those our country has signed before , reflecting the lessons of two decades of globalisation .
They include unprecedented steps to protect labour standards , the environment and intellectual property , as well as new commitments against favouritism for state-owned enterprises .
They require nations that might otherwise try to undercut us to match our high standards instead .
Our exports still face barriers in many countries .
These agreements must level the playing field .
America has less than a 1 per cent share of Japan ’ s automobile market .
As I have said directly to Japan ’ s leaders , we must address barriers to American car exports if we hope to move forward .
But the benefits are not just economic .
As America reasserts its role as a Pacific power , many in the region are asking whether we are there to stay .
Deploying soldiers and diplomats is essential .
But as other nations use their economic might to compete for influence and even coerce smaller neighbours , there is no substitute for robust American economic engagement – on behalf of our own companies and in defence of open commerce and fair competition .
The TPP has become a symbol of American staying power .
We must see it through .
Our European allies are already our security partners of first resort , from Libya to Afghanistan .
TTIP will spur growth that helps both sides of the Atlantic continue to modernise and invest in the most powerful alliance in history .
When a president receives support and guidance from Congress , that strengthens America ’ s hand at the negotiating table .
That is why the president and I have asked Congress to grant us trade promotion authority .
This means that Congress outlines US objectives in detail and sets the terms for close consultation .
Congress gets the final say when it puts the resulting agreements to a simple vote .
I realise trade can be a contentious issue .
Having run for office a few times myself , I do my best never to tell another man or woman his or her politics .
But I also believe that good policy makes good politics .
And trade that strengthens America ’ s middle class is both .
North Korea fires short range missiles
North Korea has fired two short range missiles in a second apparent show of displeasure with US-South Korean joint exercises that began last week .
The South Korean defence ministry said two missiles were fired from near the post city of Wonsan at 6.19am on Monday .
They travelled more than 500 kilometres into the ocean , but did not appear to be targeting South Korean vessels .
This comes after North Korea performed a similar exercise on Friday , firing four short-range missiles .
The defence ministry also said South Korea was monitoring the situation , with no special alert footing declared .
North Korea typically protests strongly against the annual major exercises by US and South Korean troops , which it labels preparation for an invasion .
Its ambassador to London warned early last month that the joint exercises may bring the peninsula &quot; to the brink of war &quot; , echoing bellicose rhetoric that grabbed global media attention last year .
However , Pyongyang has made a series of statements over the past two months stressing its desire to improve relations with Seoul , and last month it hosted the first reunions of families divided by the inter-Korean border since 2010 .
The South Korean ministry of defence said the joint exercises will continue as planned .
For Chinese internet finance , small is beautiful
Internet Finance is a term drawing massive attention from cities to villages across China .
By broad definition , internet finance – which includes Peer-to-Peer ( P2P ) lending and crowd funding – includes any organisation that extends their financial applications to the public over internet or any other IP network .
Heated discussion surrounds the question of whether internet finance may replace conventional banking in China , unlike in many countries where it has undergone an evolution alongside conventional banking .
To see the future of this competition , we first need to understand the fundamental differences between them .
Here let us focus on a particular class of internet finance as an example – online lending – which includes two popular models .
One is based on e-commerce , in which loans are provided to registered customers such as with Ali finance in China and Amazon in the US .
The other model is P2P lending , such Lufax and PP Dai in China , and Kabbage , Lending Club , Prosper Marketplace in the US and European countries .
Almost all online lending organisations in China and overseas target small clients .
The lending quotas of Ali Finance , for example , range from $ 8,000 to $ 160,000 and the minimum investment in Lufax is around $ 1,500 .
The average loan amount of Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace , the two largest P2P platforms in US , is around $ 12,000 and $ 7,000 respectively .
In contrast to internet finance , a lot of conventional banks prefer large customers rather than small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) .
The China Minsheng Bank , for instance , is famous for its smaller scale client business in China which has seen it lend to about 1m enterprises , but even here the average loan amount has been approximately $ 250,000 – significantly higher than that of online lending platforms .
The main reason for this dichotomy lies in the different risk management operations of conventional banks and internet finance companies .
Conventional banks rely heavily on collateral , guarantees and offline information collection , while online platforms usually require no such collateral or guarantees while relying on online information sources .
The offline information collection and collateral management functions of conventional banks are consuming of time and money ; meaning that the marginal cost of such work diminishes as the size of the loan increases .
No wonder therefore that banks prefer granting big loans based on collateral .
By contrast , online lending usually doesn ’ t require borrowers to provide collateral or guarantees .
But what makes online supply chain lending different is that they can obtain real-time transaction information through e-commerce platforms .
With sufficient information input , the lending platform may trust statistical models to evaluate borrowers ’ creditworthiness .
As the borrowers are usually small ones , they are very likely to be independent of each other , and idiosyncratic risks can be diversified away , lowering the overall risk of the lending portfolio .
Although statistical models do not guarantee 100 per cent accurate evaluations of borrowers , sound models can provide a stable accuracy ratio over time .
Nevertheless , the limited access to the credit information of individual borrowers on P2P platforms constrains risk management in P2P lending .
The truth is that a lot of burgeoning P2P platforms in China have no basic risk diversification , not to mention the risk management .
Yet predicting the future based on our current experience is very difficult , if ever possible .
Nevertheless , whether choosing large clients or small clients depends on the risk management procedure a lending organization adopts .
Based on this principal , I would imagine online lending will keep focusing on small loans .
In particular , establishing a reliable and inexpensive credit information platform is the key to the real boom of P2P lending industry , in addition to strengthening regulation .
For banks , as interest rate liberalisation proceeds , lending to small borrowers may become a “ must do ” .
In this case , banks need to find a way to lower the cost of information collection and credit evaluation procedure .
Liang Xiaozhong is deputy director of the China Banking Regulatory Commission
The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of China Banking Regulatory Commission .
On being asked about his wife , Chen Dongsheng stiffens in his large ivory-coloured armchair , but stays calm .
His office manager and translator looks more weary than worried by a question about Kong Dongmei .
In China , guanxi , or connections , have always been important , but rampant corruption in recent years has in-grained a deep cynicism about al-most all such links .
Ms Kong is a granddaughter of Mao Zedong , foun-der of the People ’ s Republic of China and after Mr Chen married Ms Kong in 2011 , the couple began to attract innuendo-laden media coverage .
Ms Kong , a decade younger than 56-year-old Mr Chen , has worked at his insurance company , Taikang Life , since its earliest days .
She also helps run a Beijing cultural centre and bookshop dedicated to communist history , and has written books about her grandfather , leading some to denigrate her for profiting from his legacy .
“ Usually , I do not answer questions on my private life , ” Mr Chen says , as we sit side by side in diplomatic formation beneath large , classical Chinese paintings .
“ &#91; But &#93; I can say that the connection of my wife has not much to do , or even has no relationship , with my business . ”
That should be businesses .
Mr Chen has founded three private companies in China and remains the largest shareholder of each .
His business card shows he is chief executive and chairman of Taikang Life , China ’ s only national life insurer with no direct government ownership , and the country ’ s fourth biggest by new business sales .
The card ’ s flipside denotes his other roles : founder and chairman of China Guardian , the world ’ s third biggest fine art auction house after Soth-eby ’ s and Christie ’ s ; and founder of ZJS Express , a Beijing-based delivery company run by Mr Chen ’ s brother .
He set up all three companies from scratch , starting in the early 1990s when Deng Xiaoping , then the Chinese leader , undertook his “ southern tour ” in 1992 to promote market ref-orms .
Deng wanted to stir China out of the political , social and econ-om-ic slump it entered after 1989 ’ s pro-democracy protests were crushed .
Mr Chen insists the three companies grew by being professional and pursuing market-oriented strategies .
The Mao name does of course still carry great prestige but the Mao family have faded from politics over many years , he says .
“ There is a saying that the hong-er-dai &#91; second generation reds &#93; is different from the guan-er-dai &#91; second generation officials &#93; , ” he says . “ For sure &#91; the former &#93; enjoy great glory and are in the spotlight , but they don ’ t have much relationship with real politics and the economy . ”
Such connections , however , mean “ we have to be more cautious , as whether you do it right or wrong , you always attract jealousy and disapproval ” .
However , he is adamant that his businesses thrive because of “ corporate culture , core competitiveness , teams and brands , and not &#91; through &#93; government connections ” .
His words are measured and Mr Chen himself is not flashy .
Today he is dressed plainly and his long , greying sideburns and low-rise quiff are from a different era to the shining jet-black coiffures of China ’ s political leaders .
Taikang ’ s offices are smart rather than opulent , although a baby-grand piano stands incongruously be-hind the executive floor receptionists .
Later , Mr Chen levels a more direct criticism at the guan-er-dai .
“ The hong-er-dai didn ’ t take ad-vantage and &#91; maintained &#93; a revolutionary quality , ” he says . “ The children of the recent government officials , however , made lots of money through their connection and power . ”
People who know Mr Chen personally or have dealt with his companies echo his depiction of his path to success .
Insurance executives and bankers describe him as extremely bright and hard working , and a charismatic leader of the 220,000 sales agents who deliver 60 per cent of his profits by selling life products door to door , as agents still do across much of Asia .
When Mr Chen first got the business bug he left a safe job as an assistant researcher in the former Ministry of International Business and Cooperation in Beijing .
It took four years for China to open up insurance to private capital and allow Taikang to win a licence .
Since then , China Guardian has been run by co-founder Wang Yannan , while Mr Chen focused on Taikang .
The notion that the Chinese central bank is waging a campaign against currency speculators conjures up an image of Beijing taking on shadowy hedge funds managed by George Soros and his cohorts .
The reality is more prosaic and hits closer to home : much of the so-called speculation on renminbi appreciation has been longer-term investment , and many of the investors are Chinese actors , including state-owned companies , rather than global financiers .
By guiding the renminbi down by 1 per cent over the past week – its steepest depreciation since China introduced a new currency system in 2005 – the People ’ s Bank of China has rekindled uncertainty about the exchange rate .
In so doing , bankers and traders who deal with the PBoC say it wants to encourage Chinese companies to be more cautious before betting on sustained appreciation – caution which in itself could slow the renminbi ’ s rise .
In early 2012 when Beijing widened the renminbi ’ s daily trading band , it vowed to make the currency more volatile , as likely to fall as it is to rise .
But since September of that year , it had drifted upwards without interruption , gaining 5 per cent against the dollar .
“ The PBoC can scream its head off about two-way &#91; exchange rate &#93; volatility , but for the past year and a half , the renminbi has only risen . It was a no-brainer to borrow dollars . It wasn ’ t speculation . It was a sure thing , ” said a bank strategist in Shanghai .
The main way in which Chinese companies have bet on a stronger renminbi is by borrowing dollars offshore , mainly in Hong Kong , and remitting that money into the mainland .
The advantages of dollar debt are clear : the renminbi ’ s appreciation makes eventual repayment easier and , more importantly , offshore interest rates are much lower than Chinese rates .
UBS estimates that banks in Hong Kong and Singapore have lent mainland companies around $ 200bn over the past 12 months alone and that $ 170bn of this has been sent back to the mainland .
Chinese companies have also been highly active in offshore bond markets .
Some of that offshore borrowing went into purely speculative carry trades .
Investors used it to take punts on the Chinese property market or to buy high-yielding shadow-bank products .
But much of it also went to the “ real ” economy , with property companies becoming particularly reliant on Hong Kong for financing .
Offshore debt accounts for 87 per cent of the total debt of China Overseas Land and Investment , a state-owned company that is one of the mainland ’ s biggest real estate developers .
Safe investing practice dictates that companies borrowing in dollars to spend renminbi should hedge their currency exposure .
Normally , they would buy contracts that guarantee them dollars at an agreed-upon price in the future when they need to repay the loans .
But the relentless appreciation of the renminbi changed that calculation .
“ Because borrowers thought there was no risk , many just decided to take the dollar spot price in two years ’ time , ” said Zhou Hao , an analyst with ANZ .
If the PBoC could make the renminbi regain volatility , it will force people borrowing offshore to hedge their risk and that will work against renminbi appreciation .
The one area in which Chinese companies have hedged heavily has been in covering their exposure to dollar earnings .
Exporters , which earn dollars but pay costs in renminbi , have been highly active in buying derivatives .
For example , Morgan Stanley estimates that $ 350bn of target redemption forwards – a product that pays out when the renminbi rises to a certain level – have been sold since the start of 2013 .
A steeper fall in the renminbi could lead to big losses for exporters , but it would be wrong to blame speculation alone for the boom in these derivatives .
“ Better export performance was also a key factor . It was largely hedging , though some might have over-hedged and taken a more aggressive view , ” said Liu Linan , a strategist with Deutsche Bank .
Strong demand for renminbi in Hong Kong at the start of this year also added to the complications in China .
Because the renminbi was trading at a premium in Hong Kong , Chinese oil companies – the country ’ s biggest corporate buyers of dollars – shifted there to buy dollars , according to a currency trader with a bank in Beijing .
The resulting drop in dollar demand in China fuelled more appreciation pressure in the mainland market .
That has gone into reverse with this week ’ s drop in the renminbi .
As companies and investors in Hong Kong unwind their positions , the currency ’ s fall in the offshore market has been even steeper than in China , eliminating the Hong Kong premium .
“ The oil companies have come back onshore to buy dollars . That is what the PBoC wanted to see , ” the trader said .
Most of the world ’ s internet titans are snapping up mobile apps and start-ups , from WhatsApp to AutoNavi to Viber .
Sina is going the opposite way .
It has appointed banks for a partial spinout of its Weibo platform , a Twitter-like microblog for the Chinese market .
Why exit as others mob the entrance ?
Sina has given no details yet .
It doesn ’ t need the cash .
It held $ 1.2bn in net cash as of September – equivalent to a quarter of its current market capitalisation and nearly four times its 2012 cash burn ( cash flow data for 2013 are not yet available ) .
That leaves the desire for a higher valuation as the most likely motive .
Alibaba bought an 18 per cent stake in Sina ’ s Weibo in April , stamping it with a value of $ 3.3bn.
But the prices of big and growing mobile communications assets have risen merrily since then .
Weibo had 60m daily active users in the third quarter of last year , and Barclays reckons it has 195m monthly users .
The market values the monthly users at Facebook and Twitter at $ 142 and $ 126 apiece , respectively .
Rakuten ’ s purchase of Viber rates its users at $ 90 .
Facebook just paid about $ 42 a subscriber for WhatsApp .
Using that last figure , Weibo would be worth $ 8.2bn ( on what is clearly a very imprecise valuation method ) .
Sina ’ s 71 per cent stake is then worth $ 5.8bn – against Sina ’ s total market capitalisation of $ 4.9bn.
The logic of the valuations may be hard to understand .
The urge to chase them is not .
This leaves two issues outstanding .
First , what happens to the rest of Sina ?
Its other business is selling internet advertising .
That is a slower-growth business , and Sina disclosures make it difficult to know how profitable it is .
Second : where is Alibaba ?
It has an option to increase its stake to 30 per cent .
If it does not do so before the float , investors may be spooked – just as their excitement about all things mobile is peaking .
Merkel joins anti-US spying push
German chancellor Angela Merkel has thrown her weight behind calls for Europe to develop internet services that are walled off from the US .
Ms Merkel ’ s weekend comments come despite intensive efforts by President Barack Obama to quell European anger over the National Security Agency revelations made public by former contractor Edward Snowden , including documents that showed that US spy agencies had tapped Ms Merkel ’ s mobile phone .
Ms Merkel said she would press French president Franois Hollande to back the push for EU-based alternatives to the current US-dominated internet infrastructure when she holds talks in Paris on Wednesday .
“ We ’ ll talk with France about how we can maintain a high level of data protection , ” Ms Merkel said in her weekly podcast .
“ Above all , we ’ ll talk with European providers that offer security for our citizens , so that one shouldn ’ t have to send emails and other information across the Atlantic . ”
One US company , which refused to be named , said there were questions over the practicalities of how email between the US and countries in this undefined new service would work .
Some tech experts have warned that proposals to build alternative networks in Europe fail to take account of how the internet operates , or the continued legal obligation of American companies to turn information over to the NSA , no matter where it is stored .
Ms Merkel ’ s decision to throw her personal backing behind EU-centric internet services reflects how politically charged the issue is in Germany .
Alibaba opens the door to US platform
Alibaba , the Chinese ecommerce company that has long -connected US brands to Chinese suppliers , now wants to help sell goods to American -consumers .
The company , which is poised for an initial public offering that analysts say could value it at more than $ 100bn , announced yesterday that it would launch its first majority-owned ecommerce venture in the US .
Two of Alibaba ’ s US subsidiaries , Vendio and Auctiva , will soon launch a business-to-consumer site , called 11 Main .
Alibaba did not give further details about 11 Main beyond describing it as a boutique ecommerce platform selling “ interesting quality products ” from “ handpicked shop owners ” .
The move is the latest by Alibaba to seek additional sources of growth .
Alibaba ’ s sites control 80 per cent of China ’ s ecommerce , and revenues from those sites last quarter grew by more than half to $ 1.78bn , but the rate of growth has slowed since last year .
Earlier this week , it made an unsolicited bid to take private AutoNavi , in an all-cash deal that values the mapping company at $ 1.6bn.
The deal would allow Alibaba to improve its mobile commerce capabilities .
Alibaba is also expanding into wealth management services and taxi hailing apps in China .
Alibaba now markets in the US mainly using Aliexpress , an English language website intended to connect US businesses with wholesalers in China .
It operates mostly in emerging markets such as Russia , India , Chile and Brazil , but also in the US .
A person with knowledge of the 11 Main launch cautioned against portraying it as a foray by Alibaba into the US , saying that despite having full ownership the venture wouild be run independently by its two subsidiaries .
Aside from a few Communist Youth League banners and a summary of the reforms unveiled at the Chinese Communist party ’ s third plenum last November , there is little to distinguish Dongfeng ’ s wholly owned Aeolus car plant from its nearby joint venture with Peugeot Citroen and Honda .
Situated in a development zone in Wuhan , an industrial city in central China , the Aeolus factory has borrowed equipment and manufacturing systems from both Peugeot and Nissan , state-owned Dongfeng ’ s third joint venture partner .
The parking lots outside each plant , however , tell a different story .
While thousands of cars are lined up outside Dongfeng ’ s Peugeot and Honda factories in Wuhan , awaiting shipment to distributors across the world ’ s largest car market , its Aeolus factory produces only about 300 vehicles a day , or about 100,000 units annually .
Dongfeng , one of China ’ s “ Big Three ” automobile groups alongside Shanghai Auto and First Auto Works , has more joint ventures with international car groups than any of its domestic peers .
Including Korean partner Hyundai , it currently operates four joint ventures and signed a fifth partnership agreement in December with Renault .
The Wuhan-based company is also poised to take a 14 per cent stake in Peugeot as part of a ￠ 3bn capital raising .
Dongfeng ’ s four joint ventures account for more than 90 per cent of the group ’ s annual passenger car sales , dwarfing those of its own Aeolus brand .
It is an imbalance shared by all of China ’ s state-owned car companies and helps explain why the country that boasts the world ’ s biggest car market has , unlike Japan and Korea before it , thus far failed to produce a national champion of its own that can compete globally .
“ On the plus side , joint ventures spin off a tremendous amount of profit for the state-owned enterprises that they ’ re affiliated with , ” says Bill Russo of Synergistics , an industry consultancy .
“ On the negative side , those profits are a drug that you become dependent on . Chinese car companies haven ’ t really been successful at investing them into their own branded vehicles . ”
Last month ( jan ) , the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced that the country ’ s car sales rose more than 15 per cent last year to 18m units – almost triple the number sold in 2008 .
During this period , the market share of Chinese brands peaked at 31 per cent in 2010 and has since fallen to 27 per cent .
Meanwhile , China ’ s 2013 car exports fell almost 10 per cent year on year to just 596,300 units – accounting for only 3.3 per cent of total production .
Imports , meanwhile , nearly tripled to 1.1m vehicles , driven by strong demand for luxury vehicles .
While China exports more cars to Algeria than any other country – with its next biggest markets being Russia , Chile and Iran – the largest source of its own automotive imports is Germany .
“ The quality of Chinese cars currently can ’ t compete with multinationals , ” says Yao Jie , deputy secretary-general of the association . “ We need to work harder to improve domestic brands . ”
According to CAAM , last year China ’ s 10 most popular models , led by the Ford Focus , were all manufactured by Sino-foreign joint ventures .
“ Most Chinese state car companies know how to bolt a car together , ” agrees Max Warburton , car analyst with Bernstein Research .
“ But replicating a foreign manufacturing system is not a particularly valuable skill set . Real skills lie in product development and in future technology . ”
On a tour of Dongfeng ’ s Aeolus plant , employees are humble but also determined .
“ I feel that we can catch up but it will take a long time , perhaps 10 years , ” says Huang Mingke , a line manager who gave up a job with Dongfeng ’ s Peugeot joint venture even though the Aeolus plant generally pays lower wages than the joint ventures .
“ We are investing a lot in critical components , such as engines and transmissions . ”
Tao Haiying , a company official , adds : “ Although we have borrowed some advanced management techniques from Peugeot and Nissan , it ’ s only a foundation on which we are building . We can study and absorb their best practices as we create our own . ”
Many analysts believe Dongfeng and its domestic peers will have to sort out their competitive issues at home before they can emerge as a threat overseas .
“ Maybe China can do something that no one else has , but I haven ’ t ever seen a car company become a successful exporter without having stable development in their home market first , ” says Mr Russo .
“ You have to achieve a certain size and scale at home before you can compete away . ”
The challenge for China ’ s car companies will be to achieve this in the world ’ s most competitive automotive industry .
When Japan and Korean automakers broke out in the 1970s and 1980s , they did so from the shelter of protected home markets .
Dongfeng ’ s pending deal with Peugeot and Geely ’ s acquisition of Sweden ’ s Volvo in 2010 suggest another way forward .
What Chinese car companies lack in experience , they can make up for in cash .
Last year Geely established a research centre in Sweden , while Peugeot offers Dongfeng a tempting short-cut in some key areas .
On 8 March 2014 , the Second Session of the Twelfth National People &apos;s Congress held a press conference at its Press Center and invited Wang Yi , China &apos;s Minister of Foreign Affairs , to answer questions from Chinese and foreign journalists about China &apos;s foreign policy and external relations .
Wang Yi : Good morning , everyone .
It is a great pleasure to meet with journalists from the press .
At the outset , on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , I would like to thank you for your interest in and understanding of China &apos;s diplomacy . I would also like to thank you for your efforts in reporting on China .
Today is the International Women &apos;s Day .
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my best festive greetings to all the ladies in this room , including those behind the cameras .

Signs of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane point to an oil slick in the Gulf of Thailand . The 12-mile-long streak of oil could be a clue as to what happened to the Boeing 777-200 that was carrying 239 passengers early Saturday morning . Flight MH370 wound up lost after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing .
New York Times reports March 8 that Malaysia ’ s prime minister , Mr. Najib , said 15 aircraft and nine ships were out searching for the jet .
It has not been confirmed that the MH370 flight lost crashed , but fuel tanks were limited in the distance it had .
The possible Malaysia Airlines oil slick discovered , would benefit crash survivors if it landed in the Gulf of Thailand due to shallow waters in that area versus deep waters in the Atlantic .
Suspicions of foul play showed up when authorities learned that two foreign citizens who stole passports from Asia were on flight MH370 .
One was an Italian and another an Austrian .
The Italian man is identified as Luigi Maraldi .
An Austrian spokesperson did not identify the Austrian .
An anonymous U.S. official want to make clear that this does not mean an act ofterrorism occurred .
“ We are not ruling out anything , ” said chief executive of Malaysia Airlines , Ahmad Jauhari Yahya , Saturday night . “ As far as we are concerned right now , it ’ s just a report . ”
According to the report from Malaysia Airlines , passengers on the plane included &quot; two infants , and an all-Malaysian crew of 12 . The passengers included 154 citizens from China or Taiwan , 38 Malaysians , seven Indonesians , six Australians , five Indians , four French and three Americans , as well as two citizens each from Canada , New Zealand and Ukraine and one each from Austria , Italy , the Netherlands and Russia . &quot;
The mythical bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto may not be a myth after all .
He may in fact be a rumpled 64-year-old man named Satoshi Nakamoto who is living quietly in the San Gabriel Valley .
A Newsweek magazine reporter says she followed a trail that led her to a Satoshi Nakamoto in Temple City .
When the reporter went to Nakamoto &apos;s home unannounced , he apparently called the Temple City police , who stood watch as a short interview was conducted .
&quot; Now face to face , with two police officers as witnesses , Nakamoto &apos;s responses to my questions about bitcoin were careful but revealing , &quot; according to the Newsweek article .
&quot; I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it , &apos; he says , dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand .
&apos;It &apos;s been turned over to other people . They are in charge of it now . I no longer have any connection . &quot;
It has been widely believed that Satoshi Nakamoto was a fake name for a programmer , probably much younger , who wished to be anonymous .
And the Satoshi Nakamoto tracked down by Newsweek is living in a modest house .
But it &apos;s believed that the real Satoshi Nakamoto holds bitcoins worth about $ 400 million .
One thing is clear : If this is the real bitcoin inventor , his life many never be the same now that his true identity has been revealed .

As relationships go , theirs is surely one of the most enduring .
Now Mr and Mrs Potato Head have had their nuptials captured on film by an inventive wedding photographer in a bid to explain his work to his young son .
Chris Thornton , 34 , was left at a loss when his three-year old son Cole asked what he did for a living .
As he was a big fan of Toy Story , Mr Thornton decided to put together some shots of the characters in the traditional wedding photograph poses .
The result will delight fans of the famous Disney Pixar films as it shows all of the characters in wedding dresses and top hats .
Mr Thornton &apos;s mother made the outfits and her house played venue for the cartoon festivities .
She even played prop assistant by pouring a watering can to provide a back drop of rain for some sparkling backdrops .
One of his most popular shots in the five years he &apos;s been photographing weddings features Buzz Lightyear holding the brides shoes .
Mr Thornton , from Leeds , said : “ Cole &apos;s first big love was Toy Story . It was one of the first things that he would sit and watch for longer than 15 minutes . And of course I love it too . Cole would always ask when I &apos;m heading out of the house if I &apos;m going to take pictures at a wedding . ”
Although he didn &apos;t really understand what this was or wasn &apos;t at all interested in any of the photos .
I thought I &apos;d try and shoot a wedding that he &apos;d be really interested in and use my job to make him smile .
“ Since then he &apos;s actually got his own little camera and did take some shots at a recent wedding I was invited to . ”
Cameras in the zoo &apos;s Panda House show Yuan Zai — whose name van be translated to mean &quot; Yuan Yuan &apos;s child ” or literally the &quot; the little round thing &quot; — slowly sliding down a hall into a common area with a mischievous smirk on her face .
She was crawling on her stomach as if to avoid detection .
Yuan Yuan sees her daughter and walks over to put her back .
She first grabs her by the neck using her mouth , and then cradles her and carries her back to her bed .
The baby did not seem happy , but couldn ’ t put up much of a fight .
Yuan Zai , who was born on July 6 , probably needs her rest as her family is the biggest attraction at the zoo .
The zoo can accomodate up to 19,000 people a day to come and see the panda family , which also includes father Tuan Tuan .
Most young adults now choose to end relationships via text , followed closely by social media .
Gone are the days of giving someone the courtesy of a face-to-face chat - most break-ups are now conducted digitally .
More than half ( 56 per cent ) of those who went through a break-up last year ended their relationship by means of technology .
Many said they chose technology as it makes the process &apos; less awkward &apos; , reveals a new report .
The American men and women surveyed had all gone through a break up in the past 12 months , and all 2,712 respondents were aged 18-30 .
Those taking part were asked how their last relationships had ended , and had to describe the &apos; means through which your break-up was finalised &apos; .
More than half ( 56 per cent ) of those who went through a break-up last year ended their relationship digitally ; either through text message , social media or email .
Two in three ( 62 per cent ) of the respondents claimed that they had been the one to end their last relationship .
The majority ( 55 per cent ) who ended their relationship via text message explained that it made the process &apos; less awkward &apos; , while 61 per cent of those who dumped on social media said they did so as they had &apos; deleted or blocked &apos; their last partner &apos;s phone number .
More than half ( 58 per cent ) of those who broke up through email claimed they had chosen that method as it allowed them to &apos; fully explain their reasons.&apos;
When asked if they would be annoyed if they were broken up with digitally , three quarters , 73 per cent , of those taking part said &apos; yes &apos; .
When asked why , the majority , 60 per cent , claimed they felt it would be &apos; too impersonal &apos; .
According to the results , just 2 per cent of respondents claimed to have broken up using a good old fashioned written letter .
The study was conducted by vouchercloud.net as part of research into the part that technology plays in the lives of American consumers , given that &apos; technology coupons &apos; were amongst the top searched-for on site for the past 12 months consecutively .
&apos;Digital has well and truly taken over , even when it comes to our relationships it seems , &apos; says a spokesperson .
&apos;However you want to break up is entirely up to you , but it may be worth noting that we found that quite a lot of people would be hurt by a digital break-up , as it &apos;s seen as a little too impersonal .
When spouses cheat on each other , the fallout can be absolutely disastrous .
Making a scene in public isn ’ t that uncommon , but this clever wife in Texas found a better , subtler way to let everyone know how disappointed she was in her cheating husband .
She took out a classified ad in a Texas newspaper , sending a message out to her husband and his mistress , signed with love .
You ’ re going to love this .
When Timeshia Brown discovered her husband Patrick was sleeping around and got a girl pregnant , she didn ’ t set his car on fire . She did , however , find a better way to burn him .
Her ad reads :
I would like to say congratulations to Shara Cormier and Patrick Brown .
They are expecting a baby .
Hope you both are really in love and I hope it works out .
It ’ s possible she meant some of the well-wishing , but you know for sure she was laughing all the way to the newspaper .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been nominated for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize ; but the conflict in Ukraine is also likely to be on the Nobel committee &apos;s agenda .
A record 278 candidates , including 47 organizations , received nominations for the 2014 prize , said the Norwegian Nobel Institute &apos;s director , Geir Lundestad .
Committee members who met on Tuesday added their own proposals with a focus on recent turmoil around the globe .
&quot; Part of the purpose of the committee &apos;s first meeting is to take into account recent events , and committee members try to anticipate what could be the potential developments in political hotspots , &quot; Lundestad said .
Russia seized control of Ukraine &apos;s Crimea region after President Viktor Yanukovich was ousted on February 22 , prompting the most serious confrontation between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War .
Pope Francis and former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden also received nominations as well as Putin .
Although nominations are kept secret for 50 years , thousands of people around the world are eligible to propose candidates , including any member of any national assembly , and many make their picks public .
The committee narrowed its list to between 25 and 40 on Tuesday and it will cut its list to about a dozen by the end of April .
First awarded in 1901 , the prize includes 8 million Swedish crowns ( $ 1.24 million ) in cash .
The winner will be announced on the second Friday of October and the prize will be presented on December 10 , the anniversary of Alfred Nobel &apos;s death .
This year ’ s gathering of China ’ s official lawmaking and top political advisory bodies , which will rubber-stamp laws and policies decided by the ruling Communist party , will be closely watched as it is the first to be held since President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang formally took the reins of government , writes Jamil Anderlini in Beijing .
Each year there is talk about whether or not these gatherings of China ’ s National People ’ s Congress and the Chinese People ’ s Political Consultative Congress remain just a political pageant , or if the party is allowing more debate to creep in .
The main topics at this week ’ s event are likely to include :
Growth targets
These are expected to remain unchanged , but if they are it could provide useful insight into the new leaders ’ thinking on the strength of the economy and how willing they are to accept lower rates of growth as they try to reform the economic model .
Real estate policy
After years of ineffectual attempts to rein in the booming property market , there are some signs the leadership is preparing policies to bring down residential prices , a source of discontent among the growing urban population .
The annual government report is often used to announce such policies .
Other areas
Reform of state-owned enterprises , pollution , foreign relations , local government debt and shadow banking .
Washington ’ s outgoing ambassador to Beijing has ended his three-year posting on a combative note , saying Chinese travellers ’ experience of freedoms and democracy during trips to the US could encourage them to “ want some of those same things ” .
Gary Locke is leaving Beijing at a time of heightened Sino-US tension over issues ranging from President Barack Obama ’ s recent meeting with the Dalai Lama , Tibet ’ s spiritual leader , to Beijing ’ s declaration of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea last year .
Since his appointment in 2011 , Mr Locke has been at the centre of a series of diplomatic spats between China and the US , one of which led to Beijing ’ s highest-level political purge since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
In a wide-ranging farewell briefing on Wednesday , Mr Locke emphasised the importance of streamlining visa applications for Chinese tourists and business people .
“ Part of the reason for doing that is to enable more Chinese to experience America , to see first-hand our freedoms , our democracy , our diversity , ” he said .
“ I hope that perhaps from their experiences in the US they ’ ll want some of those same things in China or understand what is possible in China . ”
As Washington ’ s first Chinese-American ambassador to Beijing , Mr Locke has been a popular figure in China even while clashing with Chinese government officials on a number of fronts .
He will be succeeded by Max Baucus , a former Montana senator .
In a reference to the recent war of words between Beijing and Tokyo over a group of islands administered by Japan , Mr Locke warned both sides of “ an unintended incident that leads to unintended consequences ” and also spoke of the need for “ more direct and instantaneous ” communication between the US and Chinese militaries .
The People ’ s Liberation Army and the Pentagon established a “ defence telephone link ” after a Chinese jet collided with a US surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea in 2001 .
But the DTL does not function as a direct hotline , as military-to-military discussions over it must be scheduled in advance .
“ You need to make sure there are the right people available monitoring these attempts to communicate , whether it ’ s picking up the phone or receiving the email or the secure cables , ” Mr Locke said .
“ You can have all the mechanisms in the world , but if no one ’ s there to act upon it then it doesn ’ t make much sense . ”
Mr Locke was unapologetic about his engagement with Tibetans and Uighurs – ethnic groups whose home regions in China are increasingly restive – as well as religious leaders and legal activists , saying US diplomats were eager to “ learn about what they were doing and see how we could support them ” .
“ Human rights is about more than just economic prosperity , ” Mr Locke said . “ It is also about fundamental and universal rights , freedom of speech , freedom of assembly ... We call on China to improve its record . ”
The ambassador referred to the failed asylum request in 2012 of Wang Lijun , a former Chinese police chief , as a “ very , very intense 48-hour period ” .
Mr Wang ’ s flight to a US consulate led to the purge and prosecution of Bo Xilai , the then party head of Chongqing , China ’ s most populous city .
In guiding the renminbi into its steepest dive since 2005 this week , Beijing was employing a strategy of “ one arrow , two vultures ” , as the saying goes .
The first vulture denotes the international speculators who have – in spite of warnings by Chinese officials – regarded renminbi appreciation against the US dollar as a one-way bet .
The second vulture signifies the domestic shadow financiers who refuse to be brought down to earth .
Neither of Beijing ’ s avian quarries is dead or even mortally wounded , but the renminbi ’ s surprise decline will have ruffled plenty of feathers .
More importantly , it serves notice that China is opening up a new front in its battle to reduce risks in a highly volatile financial system .
It takes a little detective work to unravel how guiding the renminbi lower helps China manage financial risks because it involves a vast twilight zone of financial dealings for which there is little data , official or otherwise .
Nevertheless , it is the dealings in this zone – which includes domestic shadow finance and irregular cross-border capital flows – that are increasingly setting the tone for Beijing ’ s policies .
The story starts with the People ’ s Bank of China ’ s repeated failure to bring shadow finance to heel .
Since the announcement of Document 463 in December 2012 , authorities have been turning up the pressure on shadow finance , mainly with the aim of preventing high-interest trust loans from triggering defaults among local government borrowers .
But official statistics show that such efforts have not yet borne fruit .
Entrusted loans rose to Rmb396.5bn ( $ 64.7bn ) in January , almost double the levels of the same month a year ago .
Worse than this failure , though , is evidence that the PBoC ’ s policies may be backfiring .
Dodging the central bank ’ s pressure to liquidate shadow financial assets ( which offer attractive returns ) , banks are opting instead to sell off lower yielding enterprise bonds ( debt issued by state-owned companies ) , thus raising the cost of financing to companies and local governments , according to research by China Confidential , a research service at the Financial Times .
While this squeezes the supply of credit to the “ real ” economy , the shadow finance segment is nourished by inflows of capital that gush through a hundred holes in China ’ s nominally “ closed ” capital account .
A shadow banker in Ningbo , eastern China , recently described the attractions of such a trade .
“ It is easy to borrow abroad at around 1 per cent annual interest . Then change that money into renminbi and bring it into the mainland , ” said the banker , who declined to be identified because of the illegal nature of his business .
“ You can get around 10 to 12 per cent by lending it to a trust or around 20 per cent by putting it with an underground bank . On top of that you get whatever the renminbi has appreciated by the time you need to repay the foreign loan . ”
One sign that this cross-border carry trade has been robust of late is evidence of an increase in the over-invoicing of exports , a common ruse used to spirit funds into the mainland .
A China Confidential survey of exporters in January found that 44 per cent of respondents thought that such fake invoicing was on the increase .
Besieged by these pressures , it is hardly surprising that the PBoC was keen to shoot an arrow .
Its hope is that by instilling in speculators ’ consciousness a sense that the renminbi can fall as well as rise , it will staunch the inrush of speculative capital lured by the outsized returns available in the mainland ’ s shadow finance markets .
In this , as ever , Beijing is looking for incremental shifts , such as the 1.2 per cent that the renminbi has depreciated by so far this year .
It knows that if it were to try to stop the inflow of illegal capital entirely , it may trigger the very wave of financial defaults it is hoping to avoid .
Thus a gradual approach using exchange rate flexibility to generate a market response seems to suit the PBoC ’ s objectives for now .
One of China ’ s best known ethnic rights activists has been charged with “ separatism ” in the restive far western region of Xinjiang , in the latest sign of a tightening by the authorities in a region that is expected to receive a surge in industrial investment .
Ilham Tohti , an economist and the most prominent voice for Uighurs in China , has not been seen since security forces detained him with some of his students in Beijing in January .
His lawyer , Li Fangping , told the Financial Times on Wednesday that authorities in Urumqi , the capital of Xinjiang , are refusing to meet him or allow him to see his client .
Xinjiang has been the scene of several violent clashes between security forces and local Uighur groups demanding more autonomy in recent years .
Mr Tohti ’ s detention came shortly before a Beijing court sentenced another progressive activist , Xu Zhiyong , to four years in prison for organising a movement that urged Communist party leaders to reveal their personal wealth .
Across the nation , dozens of less well-known ethnic rights activists , environmental campaigners , human rights activists and outspoken internet personalities have also been detained or jailed in the past year .
The Uighurs , a Turkic-speaking Muslim people , make up about half the population of Xinjiang – an oil-rich , arid region on the Chinese border with central Asia .
Chinese security forces have reported several clashes with Uighurs in recent months , including two in Aksu prefecture in the past two months in which 20 “ attackers ” were shot by police or died in explosions .
Tohti and his Mandarin-language website Uighurbiz.net was one of the only channels within China willing to cite specific local grievances , economic inequality or instigation by authorities as the cause of clashes in Xinjiang .
The Chinese government nearly always attributes unrest in the region to terrorism .
Security forces have maintained a heavy presence in Xinjiang , particularly in the Uighur heartland around Kashgar , since Uighur rioters killed about 200 people , mostly ethnic Han Chinese , in Urumqi in July 2009 .
A writer for Uighurbiz.net was jailed for 15 years for endangering state security after speaking to foreign journalists after the riot and posting critical articles online .
The crackdown on outspoken dissidents comes as Chinese state-owned companies prepare for huge mining and coal conversion projects in Xinjiang , which holds about 40 per cent of the nation ’ s coal reserves .
Most of those deposits were untapped until recently , but a decade-long central government push to “ Develop the West ” combined with more recent policies to reduce coal use in the more prosperous coastal cities has spurred investment in remote Xinjiang and across the arid north and west .
Xinjiang already accounts for almost one-third of Chinese domestic oil production and about 60 per cent of its cotton harvest .
Narendra Modi , the Indian opposition leader , has told China to abandon its “ expansionist attitude ” in a rare foray into foreign policy as his general election campaign gathers pace .
Mr Modi , prime ministerial candidate for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party , was portraying himself as an Indian patriot in a weekend speech in the Himalayan border state of Arunachal Pradesh – a territory claimed in its entirety by neighbouring China .
“ No power on earth can take away even an inch from India , ” he told a rally in Pasighat in the far northeast of India . “ China should give up its expansionist attitude and adopt a development mindset . ”
He wore a traditional hat from the local Adi tribe decorated with a hornbill ’ s giant beak .
Mr Modi , who has focused until now on his plans to restore economic growth and boost investment and jobs in India , said : “ I swear by this land that I will not let this nation be destroyed , I will not let this nation be divided , I will not let this nation bow down . ”
India ’ s governing Congress party has in the past been equally insistent on rejecting China ’ s claims over Arunachal Pradesh , but Mr Modi is eager to burnish his nationalist credentials in the run-up to the election to be held within three months .
Sanjaya Baru , director for geoeconomics and strategy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , a global security think-tank , likened Mr Modi to Shinzo Abe , the nationalist Japanese prime minister whose goals include economic revival as well as pushing his country to stand up to an increasingly assertive China .
“ Modi would project himself as a more nationalistic leader , just in the way that Abe does , ” said Mr Baru , adding that Indian foreign policy under a Modi government would probably not be fundamentally different to that of Manmohan Singh , the current Congress prime minister .
Chinese look to retail agents for a taste of luxury
May Liu earns about $ 2,500 a month as an office worker in Hong Kong , but she spends about 10 to 15 times that on luxury goods , buying everything from Prada handbags to products from US cosmetic brand Fresh .
While Ms Liu loves shopping , she buys mostly for others in her role as a “ daigou ” agent – a growing breed of people who specialise in helping mainland Chinese consumers secure products from overseas .
She started her daigou business a year ago as a way to earn more money , but the young mainland Chinese was soon bringing in up to $ 10,000 a month .
Ms Liu now has about 2,600 clients , who use Weibo , China ’ s equivalent of Twitter , and WeChat , a messaging app , to order goods .
“ I didn ’ t know how much money I would make . I didn ’ t have any expectation of profits , ” says Ms Liu , who asked to use a pseudonym . “ I only knew it would be profitable . ”
She has not given up her day job , realising that being a daigou agent , while highly profitable , can also be illegal .
Some agents focus on ferrying goods from Hong Kong to mainland China .
But the web-based phenomenon has spread to expatriate Chinese who are help compatriots back home buy brands from cities such as Paris , London , New York , Hong Kong , Tokyo and Seoul .
The daigou boom is an example of how ecommerce is rapidly transforming the Chinese retail market .
According to Chinese media , there are hundreds of thousands of people working in the daigou business .
A search for the term on Alibaba ’ s Taobao , China ’ s largest online marketplace , produces more than 240,000 virtual stores and nearly 15m items from child car seats through air purifiers to pocket printers .
The China e-Commerce Research Centre says the daigou market grew 19-fold between 2008 and 2012 when it reached Rmb48bn , and reckons that it rose again in 2013 to Rmb74bn ( $ 12bn ) .
According to a recent study by Bain , about 60 per cent of the Chinese consumers who buy luxury goods have used daigou at some point .
The business is thriving for several reasons .
Many Chinese believe the same product is better made when bought overseas because of the mainland ’ s uneven reputation for quality .
The rising strength of the renminbi , the growing purchasing power of Chinese consumers , and high-profile food safety scandals in China , have also spurred demand for safe and high-quality foreign products .
Mo Daiqing , an analyst at the e-commerce research centre , says the main reason Chinese are turning to daigou is because of hefty import tariffs on luxury goods .
China levies a 50 per cent duty on cosmetics , one of the dominant daigou categories , and that is before the imposition of the standard 17 per cent value added tax that is added to imported luxury products .
“ The same brands of milk powder , cosmetics and handbags are much cheaper in Hong Kong , the US , Japan and South Korea than in mainland China , ” said Ms Mo .
But the industry is increasingly drawing attention from customs officials in mainland China and Hong Kong , particularly with the rising numbers of so-called parallel traders who take advantage of multi-entry visas to cross the border at the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen many times a day , carrying products for resale that they do not declare at customs .
Dong Yizhi , a lawyer who specialises in ecommerce , points out that the daigou business is not illegal if the agents pay import taxes , but says that if agents pay duties the premise of the business becomes moot .
“ If they pay customs duties , the price disparities will be much smaller and they won ’ t make money , ” said Mr Dong .
Chinese citizens can legally import Rmb5,000 ( $ 823 ) of duty-free goods for personal use each time they return to the mainland .
But Shenzhen customs officers are taking a tougher line on parallel traders who cross the border back into the mainland more than once a day with goods over the value of Rmb500 .
Liu Lizhen , a Shenzhen customs official , said the move was aimed at clamping down on the abuse of the multiple re-entry system .
This has become a more serious issue in Hong Kong since 2009 when it started allowing Shenzhen permanent residents to enter the former British colony without restrictions .
“ We once found a person who had crossed the border 26 times a day , ” said Ms Liu .
According to the Shenzhen customs bureau , more than 20,000 parallel traders operate at the six land border checkpoints between Hong Kong and the southern Chinese city .
Hong Kong ’ s immigration department said just over a thousand parallel traders were arrested last year for breaching the terms of their stay in the territory .
Despite the crackdown , May Liu , the daigou agent , says she is not worried , and still travels to Shenzhen a few times a week .
“ Carrying so much stuff across the border every time provides me with a lot of exercise . I don ’ t even have to go to the gym , ” jokes Ms Liu .
‘ Brands are much cheaper in Hong Kong , the US , Japan and South Korea than China ’
China closes net around former security chief
China has placed two high-ranking officials under investigation in moves that appear to close the net more tightly around the country ’ s powerful former security chief .
The detentions are the latest in a series that have targeted former colleagues of Zhou Yongkang , who ran China ’ s domestic security apparatus until 2012 .
The Communist party is widely believed to have already placed Mr Zhou under virtual house arrest but it has yet to announce any legal action against him .
As a member of the nine-person politburo standing committee that ruled China , Mr Zhou , 71 , is the most senior politician to be caught up in a corruption investigation in decades .
In a sign that the party could be tightening its grip around him , two more former allies have been detained , adding to a growing list already under investigation , according to reports .
Shen Dingcheng , Communist party secretary of PetroChina International , the state oil company , was detained before the Chinese New Year last month , according to China Business Journal newspaper .
Mr Shen had served as secretary to “ a particular leader at China National Petroleum Corporation at some point between 1992 and 1997 ” , the newspaper reported .
It did not mention Mr Zhou by name but he was a top leader of CNPC during those years , building up a group of supporters that later came to be known as the country ’ s “ petroleum faction ” .
Three other secretaries of Mr Zhou from his time with the national oil company have already been detained .
Separately , the New York Times reported that Liang Ke , director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of State Security , was taken into custody last month by the party ’ s discipline inspection body .
The newspaper said he had been detained because of suspected corruption but added that his links to Mr Zhou also were a factor .
“ Liang Ke was detained because he is suspected of assisting Zhou Yongkang beyond approved means and channels , ” a former security official was quoted as saying .
Mr Zhou retired in 2012 and was last seen in public at a China University of Petroleum alumni celebration in October .
He had been a close ally of Bo Xilai , the former leadership hopeful who in September received a life sentence for corruption .
China ’ s Communist party has long acknowledged corruption as an existential threat to its continued rule .
Since Xi Jinping took power in late 2012 , Beijing has launched investigations targeting some of the country ’ s most powerful officials and companies as well as waging a broader campaign to rein in lavish spending by officials .
Funds launched by the likes of Alibaba have been lambasted as parasites that are endangering China ’ s economic health by a prominent commentator , the latest salvo in a battle that pits new online funds against the traditional banking system they are shaking up .
The war of words over the weekend is a sign of the growing controversy over the online investment funds , which were launched less than a year ago but have already upended traditional business models in China ’ s banking system .
Alibaba , the ecommerce company behind the biggest of the funds , shot back at the criticism , saying that its product is providing a service to the economy by putting more money in ordinary people ’ s hands .
The Chinese government caps bank deposit interest rates to limit what it fears could be damaging competition in the financial sector .
Online investment funds offered by internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent have blown a hole in that ceiling by giving savers direct access to money-market funds .
Thus depositors receive a maximum 0.35 per cent , while those investing in the Alibaba and Tencent funds are more than 15 times better off with an annual rate of 6 per cent – prompting a rechannelling of cash from banks to online funds .
Regulators have so far done little to crimp the online funds ’ development , viewing them as healthy innovations .
But the attack by Niu Wenxin , a financial editor with the state broadcaster China Central Television , suggests they could begin to face tougher opposition .
Mr Niu called for the outright prohibition of Alibaba ’ s Yu ’ e Bao fund .
“ It is attacking the financing costs of Chinese society as a whole and attacking the overall economic safety of China , ” he wrote in a blog post published on Friday .
“ Yu ’ e Bao is like a vampire that has climbed on to the body of banks . ”
With Mr Niu ’ s comments circulating widely , Alibaba used its official microblog early on Saturday to fight back .
In a post calculated to appeal to the general public , Alibaba said its fund was helping to make working people richer and the economy stronger .
“ I used to have just two steamed vegetable buns in the morning . Now I can have two meat buns ! This motivates me to work that much harder for our motherland ’ s economy every day , ” Alibaba said .
A poor country triples its trade volume in six years . Exports to its main partner soar fivefold .
This is a rare feat for a nation not blessed with oil ; rarer still for a country under UN Security Council sanctions , tightened three times during the same trade spurt .
We are talking of North Korea , believe it or not .
Unbelievers appear to include Kim Jong Un .
When the young leader brutally purged his uncle-mentor , Jang Song Thaek , in December the charge sheet included “ selling off precious resources of the country at cheap prices ” .
China does receive some ( not all ) North Korean minerals cheap , since no one else will buy .
But to be fair , on Jang ’ s watch – he oversaw trade with China – an economy still poorer on most indicators than when Moscow pulled the plug in 1991 began to grasp one big nettle : how to raise exports .
Pyongyang issues no numbers ; when they do that , we will know for sure reform is under way .
But its partners ’ recent trade statistics tell a striking story .
North Korea has never traded much , and has always run a deficit .
When the USSR collapsed , China was left as its main partner-cum-sponsor .
For many years their trade was more like aid .
In the late 1990s the value of imports from China averaged about $ 500m a year – though often they were not paid for .
Pyongyang exported next to nothing in return .
The debts mounted , as did Chinese impatience .
The deficit rose throughout the subsequent decade , reaching $ 1.3bn in 2008 – twice the level of Pyongyang ’ s exports .
In 2012 South Korean news agency Yonhap noted a startling change .
In just four years , starting in 2007 , the value of trade had almost tripled to $ 5.6bn.
At the same time , it became less one-sided ; North Korea ’ s exports more than quadrupled to $ 2.5bn.
That is still peanuts by regional and global standards , and the deficit narrowed rather than disappearing entirely .
But it began to look like serious , reciprocal trade .
The progress continues , if no longer at quite such a clip .
Latest Chinese customs statistics show that North Korean exports to China in 2013 rose 17 per cent to nearly $ 3bn , against imports of $ 3.6bn.
China apart , North Korea has , or had , only one crucial partner : South Korea : Pyongyang ’ s trade with the rest of the world in 2012 totalled less than $ 800m , according to Seoul ’ s Bank of Korea .
In 2007 after a decade of “ sunshine ” , the engagement pursued by two liberal presidents , Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun , inter-Korean trade reached $ 1.8bn , snapping at China ’ s heels .
South Korea briefly became the North ’ s biggest export market as the joint venture Kaesong Industrial Complex , in the North but near to Seoul , grew .
Larger plans were afoot .
In 2007 , at the second North-South summit , accords were signed for co-operation on shipbuilding , mining , transport and more .
A plethora of new joint committees started work quickly to implement all this .
For once the Koreas talked business , not politics .
Nothing came of it .
At the end of that year , South Koreans elected as president Lee Myung-bak , who insisted the North must first give up nuclear weapons .
The agreements were aborted and a downward spiral began .
In May 2010 , after the sinking of a South Korean warship , Mr Lee banned all inter-Korean trade and all investment except at Kaesong .
That zone alone still generated record North-South trade of $ 2bn in 2012 .
Meanwhile trade between China and North Korea leapt ahead .
Last April , Mr Kim sabotaged Kaesong , pulling out the North ’ s workers .
It reopened in September but the closure meant inter-Korean trade fell 42 per cent in 2013 to $ 1.1bn : an eight-year low , and barely one-sixth the value of trade with China .
North Korea is a risky place to do business , for Chinese as for others .
Yet well-publicised horror stories may mislead .
The numbers show that many Chinese companies have found a way to navigate the obstacles and make money .
They would not be there otherwise .
Beijing ’ s gain is Seoul ’ s loss .
Stillborn state-run projects aside , in the sunshine era a few bold companies from the South vied with China to do business in North Korea .
Outside Kaesong they all lost their shirts .
Yet it was not Kim Jong Il , the current leader ’ s father and predecessor , but Mr Lee who did for them .
The sectors affected ( mining above all ) mourn the chances lost , but politicians are in denial .
In January President Park Geun-hye told South Koreans to prepare for reunification , which she bizarrely called a “ jackpot ” .
But the Koreas can barely even agree to hold family reunions – the first in four years began this week – much less recoup ground lost under Mr Lee , whose trade ban remains in force .
Pyongyang always tries to play off its interlocutors against one another .
Conceivably , the mercurial Mr Kim might suddenly try to ditch China and re-embrace South Korea .
But Beijing will not let him and the cautious Ms Park would not have him .
Uncle Jang ’ s men may have fallen from favour but the trade ties he built will last .
Seoul blew its chance .
North Korea ’ s future now lies with China .
Nobel Prize winner Chen Ning Yang gives a talk at UM
Prof. Chen Ning Yang , the first Chinese winner of the Nobel Prize and a renowned physicist , gave a talk entitled “ My Experience as Student and Researcher ” at the University of Macau ( UM ) on 21 February .
The talk attracted a full-house audience consisting of UM teachers , students and the general public .
UM also arranged live broadcast in a classroom and on the intranet due to continued requests to register for the lecture after it was fully booked .
The talk was chaired by UM Rector Wei Zhao , who praised Prof. Yang for his internationally acclaimed academic achievements and said he is the pride of all Chinese people .
Wei Zhao expressed his hope that the talk could increase the students ’ understanding of the world and give them new inspiration .
China urges Obama to cancel Dalai Lama meeting
China called on US President Barack Obama to immediately cancel a planned meeting with the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of Tibet , and warned the meeting would “ severely impair ” Sino-US relations if it goes ahead .
Mr Obama is scheduled to welcome the exiled septuagenarian Tibetan leader at 10am Washington time on Friday and will spend just over an hour with him in the White House Map Room .
Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as a political exile and a violent anti-China separatist and regularly imposes various sanctions and punishments on governments who meet him publicly .
The Tibetan leader is usually based in Dharamsala in India and has consistently advocated non-violence and repeatedly said he wants greater autonomy for Tibet rather than outright independence .
“ By arranging a meeting between the President and the Dalai Lama , the US side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of China , seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair China-US relations , ” a spokesperson for China ’ s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday in Beijing .
The US President ’ s decision to meet the Dalai Lama is a show of concern for China ’ s human rights record but also appears aimed at warning Beijing it does not have the right to dictate who leaders of other countries can meet .
Mr Obama has met the Dalai Lama twice before , in February 2010 and July 2011 .
Like virtually every other country , the US recognises Tibet as part of China and does not support Tibetan independence but Washington also supports the Dalai Lama ’ s call for more autonomy and improvement in human rights .
Diplomats and foreign policy analysts say European leaders are very unlikely to agree to a similar meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader in the wake of China ’ s livid response to meetings by the German , French and British heads of government in recent years .
Most recently , China reacted to a meeting between UK Prime Minister David Cameron and the Dalai Lama in May 2012 by cutting off all high-level diplomatic ties for more than a year .
Relations only began to warm again after Mr Cameron reiterated Britain ’ s opposition to Tibetan independence in front of his colleagues in Parliament and later publicly stated he had no plans to meet the Dalai Lama again .
Tensions across the Tibetan plateau have been steadily rising in recent years , with widespread anger at Chinese religious and ethnic repression and the militarised occupation of many Tibetan areas .
Since 2009 , more than 120 Tibetans have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule and to call for the return of the Dalai Lama to his homeland .
Better-fed Chinese soldiers have trouble fitting into their tanks
China already has the largest army in the world .
Now its soldiers are getting bigger too .
A People ’ s Liberation Army study has concluded that its soldiers are significantly taller and fatter than they were 20 years ago – so much so that they are in danger of outgrowing their equipment .
The study recommended developing larger models of current military hardware because of the changed “ parameters ” of a generation raised on plentiful and fast food , compared with the austerity generation of the cultural revolution era .
The average height of soldiers , it said , is now 2cm greater than two decades ago , and waistlines are 5cm larger , which makes sliding into tank hatches and fitting into aircraft cockpits especially tricky .
Even the buttstocks of rifles produced for the PLA needed to be lengthened so as not to affect firing accuracy , the study said .
“ The configuration of armaments and military personnel ’ s physique should be matched because that is the only way to ensure handy use of the equipment , ” said Ding Songtao , director of the survey .
Bigger tanks will be the focus of the new generation of roomier equipment .
The low silhouettes of China ’ s main battle tanks – based on the 30-year-old Russian T-series – make them more difficult targets , but their compartments are too cramped for today ’ s beefier crews .
Owing to better nutrition , China ’ s younger generation is now much taller than its parents , although obesity is a problem .
A study by China ’ s health ministry in 2007 showed that urban Chinese boys aged six are 6.3cm taller and 3kg heavier on average than boys 30 years ago .
But the conclusion that the PLA ’ s 2.3m active personnel needed a range of supersized military hardware was met by derision from some analysts .
Jiang Lianju , a researcher with the China Academy of Military Sciences , said the size issue was a “ very minor consideration ” compared to technical specifications such as armour and combat effectiveness .
Ni Lexiong , a military expert based in Shanghai , said height and weight had always been a consideration in choosing tank crewmen .
“ Choosing tank operators is like choosing weight-lifters – both require men to be short and quick . ”
Rather than building larger tanks , it was more likely that their inside compartments could be enlarged , keeping overall size unchanged , he said .
John Kerry warns China against declaring second air defence zone
John Kerry , US secretary of state , warned China against declaring a second air defence zone three months after Beijing infuriated its neighbours by unilaterally declaring one over disputed islands in the East China Sea .
Mr Kerry also said he sought agreement from Chinese officials to pursue their claims in the South China Sea in a peaceful manner , submit them for adjudication , and negotiate a code of conduct with other regional governments that would prevent maritime confrontations from getting out of control .
“ It is important to resolve these disputes in a peaceful and non-confrontational way that honours the law of the sea and the rule of law in general , ” he said during a visit to Beijing on Friday , amid heightened tensions between China and its neighbours over a range of maritime disputes .
In November China unilaterally declared an “ air defence identification zone ” in the East China Sea which overlaps with a similar zone declared by Japan and covers a disputed chain of islands .
The US strongly criticised the move at the time as a “ provocative ” action .
Ever since there has been speculation in the Chinese press about the declaration of a second ADIZ in the South China Sea to buttress territorial claims there .
Mr Kerry said in response to a question about a second ADIZ in the South China Sea : “ With respect to the ADIZ we have indeed made clear our feelings about any unilateral announcements and I reiterated that again today . And I hope that whatever follows in the future will be done in an open transparent and accountable way . ”
An ADIZ requires foreign aircraft entering the airspace to identify themselves , and Chinese officials have stressed it is not a territorial claim .
But Shi Yinhong , a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing , said the creation of the zone “ may indirectly support territorial claims ” .
Following criticism of the ADIZ last month , the US again singled out China ’ s territorial claims earlier this month when Daniel Russel , assistant secretary of state , said in testimony to the US Congress that China ’ s claim to much of the South China sea , known as the “ nine dash line ” , was “ fundamentally flawed ” .
It was the first time the US has explicitly challenged the Chinese claim .
Wang Yi , Chinese foreign minister , told Mr Kerry on Friday that he hoped the US would respect China ’ s “ sovereign rights ” , “ treat the issue objectively and fairly ” and not take sides , the official Xinhua news agency reported .
Tempers in Beijing are frayed because many Chinese believe they have the right to assert control of their environment in the western Pacific .
Wu Shicun , director of the South China Sea Institute , said : “ I don ’ t think the US has a right to interfere in the issue ; the US is trying to use the South China Sea as a vehicle to contain China . ”
As we record this podcast , the Oscars are about to get underway in LA .
It seems there is no limit to what celebrities will do to look their best during the Hollywood ’ s glamorous award season .
But beauty treatments of all kinds are big business in the US and not just for the stars .
According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons ,
more than 15 million cosmetic surgery procedures were performed in the US last year .
BBC ’ s Lee Pattison met two Los Angles doctors to see how treatments could actually help stars reveal the best versions of themselves .
Deep breath . Exhale slowly . ” Lodie Richards gets her blood drawn for what is in the office a routine beauty treatment .

LA is cosmetic city . There ’ s no question about it .
We have people who come in who have to beg , borrow and steal , but they are doing the ‘ vampire face-lift ’ . ”
The sinister name comes from the fact that the procedure uses the patients ’ own blood .
It ’ s an especially popular pre-Oscars treatment because it ’ s non-invasive with little recovery time .
And doctor Darrel sees results . Biopsies have been done and we have actually seen new tissue growth .
This is not just a mania of cosmetics . This is the new face-lift . ” You look good . You wanna look better .

Meanwhile , in Moscow President Putin insists he still recognizes Ukraine ’ s ousted President Viktor Yanukovych as the legitimate leader .
“ It ’ s clear he doesn &apos;t have any power . That ’ s understandable .
I want to repeat that the legitimate president in purely legal terms is of course Yanukovych . ”
So what impact might this have for the US Secretary of States meeting in Kief with those who replaced him ?
Also in this podcast , an ancient virus has been brought back to life by French scientists after lying dormant for at least 30,000 years .
And we ’ ll hear about the last letters written by Japanese Kamikaze pilots to their loved ones during the World War II .
“ Dear mother , my one regret is I could not do more for you before I die .
But to die as a fighter for the Emperor is an honor . It is something you can feel happy about . Do not feel sad . ”
Could climate change unleash deadly viruses that have lain dormant for thousands of years .
It ’ s possible according to a group of French scientists
who have for the first time revived an ancient virus that have been buried in Siberian permafrost for 30,000 years .
Fortunately , the one they found wasn &apos;t deadly to humans but it did cause some nasty damage to an amoeba they tested it on .
Our science reporter Rebecca Morelle spoke about the findings .
“ It ’ s an absolutely incredible piece of research .
So the viruses was found varied about 30 meters down in the Siberian permafrost .
And it ’ s been lying there dormant , not doing anything for the last 30,000 years .
It ’ s also quite a weird virus , too . It ’ s very big in size .
You can actually see it under a microscope , which is really unusual for a virus and it ’ s the biggest scientists have found so old and revived . ”
“ And it ’ s under control or not ? ” “ Yes . So the good news is this doesn &apos;t actually affect humans or animals .
But scientists all worried that there could be more deadly viruses lurking down there in the deep place at the permafrost , smallpox for example .
That was around thousands of years ago . It ’ s eradicated now on the surface , but there is a chance if those deep places were penetrated . ”

The former Turkish military chief , Ilker Basbug has been released from a life sentence , imposed for conspiring to overthrow the government .
In a televised statement , he said the Turkish nation had understood that he and other convicted officers had nothing to do with plotting coups .
He called for justice against those who &apos;d had him locked up for more than two years . From Istanbul S G reports .
General Basbug &apos;s release could prove a turning point in the so-called Ergenekon trials in Turkey which have seen dozens of senior officers , lawyers and journalists jailed .
General Basbug was convicted of plotting to overthrow the government last year .
But on Thursday , Turkey &apos;s top court decided that the correct trial procedures had been followed .
The trials were seen as part of a long-running battle by the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to tame Turkey &apos;s powerful armed forces .

and the third day running , they &apos;ve been turned back . This time though , there were some additional menace in the air .
The armed men who stopped them fired warning burst of automatic gunfire .
The fact of shots were fired , albeit as a warning ,
is likely to be seen as another show of Russian defiance in Crimea and another slap in the face for the international community .
The Untied States says it &apos;s deeply concerned about what is described as the recent escalation of violence in the Sudanese region of Darfur .
There &apos;s been no word so far from Khartoum . Here &apos;s our Africa editor Mary Harper .
In a statement , the US State Department said government-allied militias had recently burned homes and attacked civilians near the town of Nyala , causing thousands of people to flee .
The US said the Sudanese air force had been involved , and urged Khatoum to stop its campaign of aerial bombardments in Darfur .
The US said the people of Darfur have suffered insecurity , violence and atrocities for far too long
and that now was the time for peaceful resolution to the violence.World News from the BBC
The Syrian government says it &apos;s seized a town from rebels near the Lebanese border as part of its efforts to block their supply lines . Sebastian Usher reports .
Battles continue to rage across Syria , some more significant than others .
That &apos;s certainly how the Syrian government is talking up its recapture of the town of Zara .
It &apos;s important to the government because it &apos;s near the border with Lebanon , from where rebel fighters run vital supply lines for weapons and reinforcements .
President Assad &apos;s supporters are trying to block these , and may now be closed doing so .
Since last month , they &apos;ve been bombarding in Yabroud , some 40 kilometers south along the border .
The storming of Zara maybe a foretaste of what &apos;s installed for that town &apos;s remaining residents .
Opposition activists say some of those left in Zara were killed in their homes .
Several thousand people have marched through the Lebanese capital Beirut to demand the passage of law , protecting women against domestic violence .
The rally coincides with International Women &apos;s Day .
Lebanon is one of the most liberal countries in the Arab World ,
but there &apos;s no law protecting women from violence by their fathers , husbands or brothers .
Thousands of Venezuelan students and opposition supporters have gathered for an anti-government rally in the capital Caracas .
The government has deployed thousands of security officers to prevent a planed march towards the food ministry .
President Nicolas Maduro said all parties were invited to take part in a dialogue for peace .
But the opposition has said any participation will be conditional on the release of detained students .
At least 21 people have been killed in nearly a month of protests .
Italy has urged ArmaLite in the United States to withdraw an advertisement , showing an image of Michelangelo &apos;s David holding a rifle .
The Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said the government would take legal action against the company unless it immediately withdraws the campaign .
He said the image of an armed David was not only offensive but also illegal .
When The Boss Works Long Hours , Do We All Have To ?
The problem : Every night , your workaholic boss is still glued to the computer when you need to leave .
How to go home without looking like a slacker ?
Should you sneak out , hoping to avoid a six o &apos;clock showdown in the hall ?
Guiltily apologize , promising to be on email all night ?
Or just walk straight toward the door in the most professional way you can ?
Many hard-working employees have an even harder-working boss who toils late into the night .
Career coaches and employees who have been there say the first priority should be conveying that you are still working hard -- and good at your job .
That requires communicating clearly and frequently about your progress and results .
Ideally , you want to figure out what the boss really needs and deliver it consistently enough that your hours become a non-issue .
Many employees assume managers value people for working day and night , and workplace trends support that belief : Two-thirds of workers are putting in much longer hours on the job than five years ago , according to a poll of 325 employees last fall by Right Management , Milwaukee , a talent and career-management company .
But before you get too hung up on work hours , check your assumptions about what the boss wants , says Cali Williams Yost , chief executive officer of Flex + Strategy Group , a Madison , N.J. , training and consulting firm .
Managers work long hours for a variety of reasons : It may be a personal habit or preference , or perhaps they just don &apos;t want to go home .
&apos;People make way too many guesses about managers &apos; expectations that are just wrong , &apos; Ms. Yost says .
Bosses are often taken aback by employees &apos; focus on their schedules .
Betty Enyonam Kumahor often works 14-hour days , emailing and calling contacts around the world . &apos; My teams started tracking how many hours they thought I slept each night , based on my email &apos; send &apos; times , &apos; says Ms. Kumahor , a regional managing director in Atlanta for ThoughtWorks , a software-development company .
&apos;They asked me jokingly , &apos; Do you ever sleep ? &apos; &apos; She assured employees she would stop sending so many late-night and early-morning emails so they didn &apos;t have to extend their hours to respond .
When managers focus on employees &apos; work hours , they are often looking for reassurance on other fronts : that their subordinates are meeting deadlines ; that they can be reached when needed , and that they aren &apos;t creating extra work for colleagues , Ms. Yost says .
Rich Gee &apos;s boss on a former job took him aside and criticized him for leaving the office at 5 p.m. , says Mr. Gee , a Stamford , Conn . , executive coach .
The manager acknowledged that Mr. Gee was meeting deadlines and delivering good work ; he arrived at the office at 6 : 30 a.m. , two hours before his co-workers .
The boss seemed nervous , however , that Mr. Gee wouldn &apos;t be available when needed .
Mr. Gee said he could be reached 24 / 7 by cellphone , and pointed out that he always responded quickly to emergency requests .
He continued to leave the office at 5 p.m. , but updated his boss often on his progress and results and checked in every evening before he left .
In time , he says , his boss &apos; saw that it wasn &apos;t hours that mattered -- it was how hard I worked.&apos;
One key to Mr. Gee &apos;s solution : healthy communication .
Employees should sit down with their bosses and ask them to define job objectives and time lines for reaching them , says Pat Katepoo , the Kaneohe , Hawaii-based owner of WorkOptions , a consulting firm . Then &apos; look for natural times to communicate about your progress , when you have a staff meeting or you &apos;re walking by or writing an email , &apos; says Ms. Katepoo .
There are many ways to project a hard-working image .
If a manager speaks about a project in an intense , focused way , answer with similar intensity , acknowledging its importance and repeating the deadline , says Anne Brown , an advertising executive who has written about how young employees can deal with workaholic bosses in a book , &apos; Grad to Great , &apos; and on a website she co-founded , GradtoGreat .
Manage time well in one-on-one meetings , moving quickly through your agenda , adds Ms. Brown , of Kansas City , Mo . And , of course , be prepared to work long hours during a crisis or busy season , or when a major project deadline is looming .
In some cases , shifting your work hours can help .
At companies where managers focus on face time , employees who work 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. -- when more people are present -- are more likely to get noticed than those who work 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Executive coach Michael Melcher was told in a previous job at an investment bank that &apos; I wasn &apos;t working long enough hours , &apos; he says . &apos; I started coming in later and staying later , &apos; he says .
&apos;A couple of months later , my boss said , &apos; It hasn &apos;t gone unnoticed that you &apos;re putting in additional hours . &apos; &apos;
Faking a presence at the office , however , doesn &apos;t work .
Throwing your coat over your chair as if you just stepped away , then leaving for the day , is likely to backfire , Ms. Yost says .
Colleagues will &apos; think you &apos;re there and run around like crazy people trying to find you.&apos;
Another nonstarter , says Mr. Melcher , an executive coach with Next Step Partners , New York , is &apos; being a whiny complainer , with a lot of exasperated sighs , saying you &apos;re working your fingers to the bone . Nobody wants to hear that.&apos;
In some professions , working long hours is unavoidable .
Certain firms &apos; cultures breed intense competition and long hours among new hires , says Julie Cohen , a Philadelphia career and personal coach .
Others have unwritten cultural rules , such as , &apos; Nobody leaves the office before the boss leaves , &apos; she says .
It is wise to prove yourself on the job for at least six months and ask a mentor for advice before exploring shorter hours , Ms. Cohen says .
&apos;You might be stepping into a minefield if you don &apos;t understand the ins and outs of the organization.&apos;
To get the most out of a negotiation about hours , Mr. Melcher says , think in advance about the boss &apos;s needs , and bring specifics documenting your own performance .
Start on a positive note , talking about what &apos;s going well .
Ask what the boss expects of employees when it comes to work hours and responding to email .
To propose solutions , Mr. Melcher recommends the &apos; yes . . .
and &apos; technique : Affirm the boss &apos;s point , and then state your own .
For example : &apos; Yes , I want you to be able to rely on me after hours . And since I have young twins , it is important to me to be home between 5 : 30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and spend that time with family . I could respond to you between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. How does that sound ? &apos;
Such conversations can open a dialogue -- or expose a brick wall .
When project manager Ashanti Stanford raised the issue with a boss at a previous job , the manager rolled her eyes and sighed . &apos; The expectation was , &apos; I have to work these hours , so why are you complaining ? &apos; &apos; Ms. Stanford says . She has since moved on to a job with better hours .
It has long been said that a man with a good sense of humour can laugh a woman in to bed , despite his looks .
Now researchers believe the opposite may also be true - that we also find attractive members of the opposite sex more amusing .
Psychologists at the University of Stirling have discovered that good-looking people were perceived as funnier when the people listening to them could see what they looked like - i.e. whether they were attractive or not .
In the study , undergraduate psychology students were videoed while being asked which two items they would take to a desert island , and why .
They could pick from either chocolate , hairspray or a plastic bag .
While the students weren &apos;t told that the study was about humour , the vast majority gave the appearance of trying to be funny in their answers .
Other students were then asked to rate the desert-island comments for wit , as well as how attractive each of the commenters might be for a short-term or long-term relationship .
The researchers found that attractive individuals were rated as funnier in video clips than their less dashing counterparts .
Funnier men were also considered most attractive for a fling , the researchers found .
This might be because wit may give off the impression of not being serious or willing to commit to a long-term relationship .
Being recorded on video also made a real difference .
Men who were videoed were generally considered more amusing than those who only had their voices recorded and provided a photo of themselves .
One theory is that men , in particular , use humour as a mating signal , to show-off their intelligence and good genes to women .
Another is that we use wit to indicate we are sexually attracted to people .
The study was published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences .
10 biggest patent troll targets in business
Wireless carrier AT &amp; T ( T ) was the top target of so-called patent trolls in 2013 , having been sued more than 54 times by them in 2013 — more than once a week .
This year &apos;s list of top ten patent troll targets was published today in a Fortune magazine feature story about RPX Corp. ( RPXC ) , which compiled the statistics .
The article , called &quot; Taking on the Trolls , &quot; states : &quot; AT &amp; T is no anomaly . Google ( GOOG ) was hit with 43 &#91; such &#93; suits last year ; Verizon ( VZ ) , 42 ; Apple ( AAPL ) , 41 ; Samsung ( SSNLF ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) , 39 each ; Dell and Sony ( SNE ) , 34 each ; Huawei , 32 ; Blackberry ( BBRY ) , 31 . Every brand on this unenviable top-ten list was sued by &#91; a patent troll &#93; at least once every 12 days . &quot;
&quot; Patent troll &quot; is a pejorative term .
A more neutral term , and the one that RPX uses , is &quot; non-practicing entity , &quot; or NPE .
An NPE is a company that sells no products or services of its own .
In their most controversial form , NPEs purchase patents on the open market and then assert them against operating companies , like AT &amp; T and Google , seeking licensing fees and , often , suing to get them .
RPX is what &apos;s known as a defensive patent aggregator .
In exchange for a subscription fee — currently paid by some 168 companies , including Google , Verizon , and Samsung — it attempts to buy up potentially problematic patents on the open market , before NPEs can get their hands on them .
According to RPX &apos;s statistics — which have been relied upon by academics and government agencies — NPEs filed 3,608 new suits in 2013 , up 19 % from the 3,042 they filed in 2012 , and their suits named 4,843 total defendants , up 13 % from the 4,282 sued a year earlier .
NPE suits accounted for 67 % of all new patent cases filed last year , and 63 % of all new patent defendants , according to the figures RPX shared with Fortune .

The Creature in the Shop
My name is Dr Frederick Treves . I am a doctor at the London Hospital .
One day in 1884 , I saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital .
I stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture .
At first I felt interested , then I felt angry , then afraid .
There was a man in the picture , but he did not look like you and me .
He did not look like a man . He looked like an elephant .
I read the writing under the picture . It said ： Come in and see the Elephant Man . 2 pence .
I opened the door and went in .
There was a man in the shop . He was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth .
‘ What do you want ？ ’ he asked .
‘ I &apos;d like to see the elephant man , please , ’ I said .
The man looked at me angrily .
‘ Well , you can &apos;t , ’ he said . ‘ The shop &apos;s closing now . You can come back tomorrow . ’
‘ I &apos;m sorry , ’ I said . ‘ But I would like to see him now . I have no time tomorrow — I have a lot of work to do . But I can give you more than 2 pence . ’
The man looked at me carefully . Then he took the cigarette out of his mouth and smiled with his yellow teeth .
‘ All right , sir , ’ he said . ‘ Give me twelve pence then . ’
I gave him the money and he opened a door at the back of the shop .
We went into a little room . The room was cold and dark , and there was a horrible smell in it .
A creature sat on a chair behind a table .
I say a creature , because it was not a man or a woman , like you or me .
The creature did not move or look at us . It sat very quietly on the chair in the cold , dark , dirty room , and looked at the table . On the table in front of it , there was a dead flower .
‘ Stand up ! ’ said the shopkeeper , loudly .
The creature stood up slowly . It took the old cloth off its head , and put it on the chair .
I looked at the creature and felt sad .
I am a doctor , so I know a lot about accidents and ill people .
I see horrible , ugly things every day . But this creature , this thing , was the worst of all .
There were no men or women in the hospital like him .
He wore some old trousers , but no shirt , coat , or shoes , so I could see his body very well .
His head was the most interesting thing . It was very , very big — like an enormous bag with a lot of books in it .
The head did not have much hair , and there was another bag of brown , dirty skin at the back of it . This skin came down below his neck .
I could not see one of his eyes very well , because a lot of skin came down in front of his face , too .
An enormous red tooth came out of his mouth , under his nose . It looked like an elephant &apos;s tooth . The mouth and nose were like holes in the face . The face could not smile or laugh or look angry or sad , because the skin could not move . It was dead , like an elephant &apos;s face .
There were more bags of dirty skin on the front and back of the creature &apos;s body . These bags came down to his legs .
The right arm was enormous , and there were bags of skin on it , too . The right hand was like a man &apos;s foot .
But the left hand the left arm and the left hand were beautiful ! The left arm had wonderful skin , and the fingers of the left hand were long and beautiful . It was like a young woman &apos;s hand !
‘ Walk , Merrick ! ’ said the shopkeeper angrily . ‘ Come on , quickly , move ! ’
He hit the creature with his hand .
Slowly , the creature walked across the room .
But he could not walk well . His legs were very big and fat , and he had a bad back . He could not walk far without a stick .
‘ All right , thank you , ’ I said . ‘ Let him sit down . I don &apos;t want to see any more . ’
I felt ill , and the smell in the room was very bad .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ said the shopkeeper . ‘ Sit down , Merrick . ’
We went out of the room and closed the door .
The shopkeeper smiled at me with his yellow teeth .
‘ Wonderful , sir , isn &apos;t it ？ ’ he said . ‘ The best Elephant Man in England ! Hundreds of people come to see him , you know , hundreds ! I take him all over the country , I do ! ’
‘ Yes , very interesting , ’ I said . ‘ Can I sit down ？ ’
‘ Yes , sir , of course . Here &apos;s a chair . ’ He looked at me , smiling . ‘ Would you like a glass of water , sir ？ ’
‘ Yes , please , ’ I said .
Then I looked at the things in the dirty shop . There were two or three bad apples and some old black bananas ： that was all .
‘ Er , no … no , thank you . I &apos;m all right , ’ I said . ‘ Did you … did you call the creature Merrick ？ ’
‘ That &apos;s right , sir . Joseph Merrick . The best ElephantMan in England ! I take him all over the country , you know . Lots of people want to see him . ’
&apos;What do you want ? &apos; said Mr Dombey .
&apos;If you please , Sir , I wish to speak to you , &apos; said Susan .
Mr Dombey moved his lips as if he were repeating the words , but he seemed so lost in astonishment at the presumption of the young woman as to be incapable of giving them utterance .
&apos;I have been in your service , Sir , &apos; said Susan Nipper , with her usual rapidity , &apos; now twelve &apos; year a waiting on Miss Floy my own young lady who couldn &apos;t speak plain when I first come here and I was old in this house when Mrs Richards was new , I may not be Meethosalem , but I am not a child in arms.&apos;
&quot; You know my methods of work , Mr. Mac . But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible . I only wish to verify my details in one way , which can very readily be done , and then I make my bow and return to London , leaving my results entirely at your service . I owe you too much to act otherwise ; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study . &quot;
&quot; This is clean beyond me , Mr. Holmes . We saw you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last night , and you were in general agreement with our results . What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case ? &quot;
&quot; Well , since you ask me , I spent , as I told you that I would , some hours last night at the Manor House . &quot;
Well , what happened ?
Ah , I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment .
By the way , I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building , purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist .
Here Holmes drew a small tract , embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House , from his waistcoat pocket .
You are making fools of us , Mr. Holmes !
“ What use is your life to anyone ? When I think of what you ’ ve made of it the phrase ‘ pig ’ s ear ’ comes irresistibly to my mind . ”
“ But I was President of the Galaxy , man ! ”
“ Huh , ” muttered his ancestor , “ And what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox ? ”
“ Hey , what ? Only President you know ! Of the whole Galaxy ! ”
“ Conceited little megapuppy . ”
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment .
“ Hey , er , what are you at , man ? I mean Great Grandfather . ”
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee . This had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn ’ t feel a thing .
“ You know and I know what being President means , young Zaphod . You know because you ’ ve been it , and I know because I ’ m dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective . We have a saying up here . ‘ Life is wasted on the living . ’ ”
“ Yeah , ” said Zaphod bitterly , “ very good . Very deep .
Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads . ”
“ Fifty seconds , ” grunted Ford Prefect .
“ Where was I ? ” said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth .
“ Pontificating , ” said Zaphod Beeblebrox .
“ That ’ s right guys , ” the computer sang out suddenly .
“ just coping with that problem right now , and wow , it ’ s a biggy . Be with you in a while . ” It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent .
As if to relieve the tension , the Vogons chose that moment to start firing .
The ship shook , the ship thundered . Outside , the inch thick force-shield around it blistered , crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon , and looked as if it wouldn ’ t be around for long .
Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it .
“ Three minutes and fifty seconds , ” he said a short while later .
“ Forty-five seconds , ” he added at the appropriate time . He flicked idly at some useless switches , then gave Arthur an unfriendly look .
“ Dying for a cup of tea , eh ? ” he said . “ Three minutes and forty seconds . ”
“ Will you stop counting ! ” snarled Zaphod .
“ Yes , ” said Ford Prefect , “ in three minutes and thirty-five seconds . ”
To distinguish real friends from real enemies , we must make a general analysis of the economic status of the various classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes towards the revolution .
At the slightest provocation they make arrests , crown the arrested with tall paper hats , and parade them through the villages , saying , &quot; You dirty landlords , now you know who we are ! &quot;
Since this theory impedes the rise of the peasant movement and so disrupts the revolution , we must firmly oppose it .
&quot; We joined the peasant association long ago , &quot; they say to the rich peasants , &quot; why are you still hesitating ? # The rich peasants answer mockingly , &quot; What is there to keep you from joining ? # You people have neither a tile over your heads nor a speck of land under your feet ! &quot;
We must combat the counter-revolutionary talk of a &quot; movement of riffraff &quot; and a &quot; movement of lazy peasants &quot; and must be especially careful not to commit the error of helping the local tyrants and evil gentry in their attacks on the poor peasant class .
Therefore , our present task is to lead the peasants to put their greatest efforts into the political struggle , so that the landlords &apos; authority is entirely overthrown .
&quot; Well , well , &quot; said Holmes gleefully , &quot; you have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend ! It &apos;s a lesson in being practical , Mr. Mac . &quot;
&quot; Ay , it &apos;s just that , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said the inspector with satisfaction .
&quot; But this may all fit in with your theories , &quot; I remarked .
&quot; That may or may not be . But let us hear the end , Mr. Mac . Was there nothing to identify this man ? &quot;
So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification .
There were no papers or letters , and no marking upon the clothes .
A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table .
He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle , and no more was heard of him until our inquiries .
&quot; That &apos;s what puzzles me , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said White Mason .
If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him , one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist .
As it is , he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder .
So one would imagine .
Still , he has been justified of his wisdom up to date , at any rate , since he has not been taken .
But his description--what of that ?
MacDonald referred to his notebook .
He stopped again , as if to discover whether he had led Mr Dombey far enough yet . And again , with his chin resting on his hand , he leered at the picture .
&apos;Carker , &apos; said Mr Dombey , &apos; I am sensible that you do not limit your - &apos;
&apos;Service , &apos; suggested his smiling entertainer .
&apos;No ; I prefer to say your regard , &apos; observed Mr Dombey ; very sensible , as he said so , that he was paying him a handsome and flattering compliment , &apos; to our mere business relations . Your consideration for my feelings , hopes , and disappointments , in the little instance you have just now mentioned , is an example in point . I I am obliged to you , Carker.&apos;
“ Yes , ” said Ford Prefect , “ in three minutes and thirty-five seconds . ”
Experience has shown that in enemy-occupied areas it is best not to magnify the class contradiction among the Chinese ; the basic idea should be to unite all Chinese in the fight against the enemy .
Experience has also shown that achieving unity of the Chinese against the enemy involves a struggle , too .
Fifth , they should at all times secretly look after the interests of the Chinese people , especially anti-Japanese revolutionaries .
Doing Everything to Safeguard the Interests of the Chinese People .
Members of our guerrilla units and armed working teams in enemy-occupied areas should aim at safeguarding the interests of the Chinese people ; this is a matter of preserving the might of the country and building up our strength and is the starting point of our revolutionary work in these areas .
Since there are 450 million people in China and only 2 billion people in the world , our victory will mean the victory of one-fourth of the world &apos;s population .
Therefore , opposing feudalism is a fundamental task of the Chinese revolution .
In “ Introducing The Communist ” , Chairman Mao pointed out that the united front , armed struggle and Party building are the three fundamental questions in the Chinese revolution .
The reason for our victory in the Chinese revolution was that we successfully handled the three questions .
In China most of the minority nationalities live in the northwest and southwest .
Historically , China &apos;s minority nationalities have been estranged to a high degree from the Han nationality .
We should convince the various minority nationality people that , politically , all nationalities within China &apos;s boundaries are truly equal , that their living standards can be improved and that their cultural level can be raised .
In China , Mao Zedong Thought -- the integration of the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution --can also help solve this problem .
The Characteristics of the Chinese Bourgeoisie .
The Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party , held 11 years ago , laid down the following principle : we shall integrate the universal truth of Marxism and Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution as a guide for our country &apos;s revolution and development .
These were the first words of antagonism .
To fling elaborate sarcasms at Tess , however , was much like flinging them at a dog or cat .
The charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated , and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled .
She remained mute , not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her .
She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek , a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled , like the object lens of a microscope .
Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life , in his universe , returned to him , and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood .
Some consequent action was necessary ; yet what ?
&apos;Tess , &apos; he said , as gently as he could speak , &apos; I cannot stay - in this room - just now . I will walk out a little way.&apos;
He quietly left the room , and the two glasses of wine that he had poured out for their supper - one for her , one for him - remained on the table untasted .
This was what their Agape had come to .
At tea , two or three hours earlier , they had , in the freakishness of affection , drunk from one cup .
The closing of the door behind him , gently as it had been pulled to , roused Tess from her stupor .
He was gone ; she could not stay .
Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed , putting out the candles as if she were never coming back .
The rain was over and the night was now clear .
She was soon close at his heels , for Clare walked slowly and without purpose .
His form beside her light gray figure looked black , sinister , and forbidding , and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud .
Clare turned at hearing her footsteps , but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference in him , and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house .
The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water , the rain having been enough to charge them , but not enough to wash them away .
Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick transit as she passed ;
she would not have known they were shining overhead if she had not seen them there - the vastest things of the universe imaged in objects so mean .
The place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same valley as Talbothays , but some miles lower down the river ; and the surroundings being open she kept easily in sight of him .
Away from the house the road wound through the meads , and along these she followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him , but with dumb and vacant fidelity .
At last , however , her listless walk brought her up alongside him , and still he said nothing .
The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment , and it was mighty in Clare now .
The outdoor air had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse ; she knew that he saw her without irradiation - in all her bareness ;
that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then--
Behold , when thy face is made bare , he that loved thee shall hate ;
Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate .
For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain ;
And the veil of thine head shall be grief , and the crown shall be pain .
He was still intently thinking , and her companionship had now insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought .
What a weak thing her presence must have become to him !
She could not help addressing Clare .
&apos;What have I done - what have I done ! I have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you . You don &apos;t think I planned it , do you ? It is in your own mind what you are angry at , Angel ; it is not in me . O , it is not in me , and I am not that deceitful woman you think me ! &apos;
&apos;H &apos;m - well . Not deceitful , my wife ; but not the same . No , not the same . But do not make me reproach you . I have sworn that I will not ; and I will do everything to avoid it.&apos;
But she went on pleading in her distraction ; and perhaps said things that would have been better left to silence .
&apos;Angel ! - Angel ! I was a child - a child when it happened ! I knew nothing of men.&apos;
&apos;You were more sinned against than sinning , that I admit.&apos;
&apos;Then will you not forgive me ? &apos;
&apos;I do forgive you , but forgiveness is not all.&apos;
&apos;And love me ? &apos;
To this question he did not answer .
O Angel - my mother says that it sometimes happens so !
- she knows several cases where they were worse than I , and the husband has not minded it much - has got over it at least .
And yet the woman has not loved him as I do you !
Don &apos;t , Tess ; don &apos;t argue .
Different societies , different manners .
You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman , who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things .
You don &apos;t know what you say .
&apos;I am only a peasant by position , not by nature ! &apos;
She spoke with an impulse to anger , but it went as it came .
So much the worse for you .
I think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue .
I cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other fact - of your want of firmness .
Decrepit families imply decrepit wills , decrepit conduct .
Heaven , why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent !
Here was I thinking you a new-sprung child of nature ; there were you , the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy !
Her narrative ended ; even its re-assertions and secondary explanations were done .
Tess &apos;s voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone ; there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind , and she had not wept .
But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed .
The fire in the grate looked impish - demoniacally funny , as if it did not care in the least about her strait .
The fender grinned idly , as if it too did not care .
The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem .
All material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration .
And yet nothing had changed since the moments when he had been kissing her ; or rather , nothing in the substance of things .
But the essence of things had changed .
When she ceased the auricular impressions from their previous endearments seemed to hustle away into the corners of their brains , repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind foolishness .
Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire ; the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him .
After stirring the embers he rose to his feet ; all the force of her disclosure had imparted itself now .
His face had withered .
In the strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor .
He could not , by any contrivance , think closely enough ; that was the meaning of his vague movement .
When he spoke it was in the most inadequate , commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him .
&apos;Tess ! &apos;
&apos;Yes , dearest.&apos;
Am I to believe this ?
From your manner I am to take it as true .
O you cannot be out of your mind !
You ought to be ! Yet you are not ... . My wife , my Tess - nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that ? &apos;
&apos;I am not out of my mind , &apos; she said .
&apos;And yet-- &apos; He looked vacantly at her , to resume with dazed senses : &apos; Why didn &apos;t you tell me before ? Ah , yes , you would have told me , in a way - but I hindered you , I remember ! &apos;
These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed .
He turned away , and bent over a chair .
Tess followed him to the middle of the room where he was , and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep .
Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot , and from this position she crouched in a heap .
&apos;In the name of our love , forgive me ! &apos; she whispered with a dry mouth . &apos; I have forgiven you for the same ! &apos;
And , as he did not answer , she said again--
&apos;Forgive me as you are forgiven ! I forgive you , Angel.&apos;
&apos;You - yes , you do.&apos;
&apos;But you do not forgive me ? &apos;
&apos;O Tess , forgiveness does not apply to the case ! You were one person ; now you are another . My God - how can forgiveness meet such a grotesque - prestidigitation as that ! &apos;
He paused , contemplating this definition ; then suddenly broke into horrible laughter - as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell .
&apos;Don &apos;t - don &apos;t ! It kills me quite , that ! &apos; she shrieked . &apos; O have mercy upon me - have mercy ! &apos;
He did not answer ; and , sickly white , she jumped up .
&apos;Angel , Angel ! what do you mean by that laugh ? &apos; she cried out . &apos; Do you know what this is to me ? &apos;
He shook his head .
&apos;I have been hoping , longing , praying , to make you happy ! I have thought what joy it will be to do it , what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not ! That &apos;s what I have felt , Angel ! &apos;
&apos;I know that.&apos;
I thought , Angel , that you loved me - me , my very self !
If it is I you do love , O how can it be that you look and speak so ?
It frightens me !
Having begun to love you , I love you for ever - in all changes , in all disgraces , because you are yourself .
I ask no more .
Then how can you , O my own husband , stop loving me ?
&apos;I repeat , the woman I have been loving is not you.&apos;
&apos;But who ? &apos;
&apos;Another woman in your shape.&apos;
She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times .
He looked upon her as a species of impostor ; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one .
Terror was upon her white face as she saw it ; her cheek was flaccid , and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole .
The horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered ; and he stepped forward , thinking she was going to fall .
&apos;Sit down , sit down , &apos; he said gently . &apos; You are ill ; and it is natural that you should be.&apos;
She did sit down , without knowing where she was , that strained look still upon her face , and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep .
&apos;I don &apos;t belong to you any more , then ; do I , Angel ? , she asked helplessly . &apos; It is not me , but another woman like me that he loved , he says.&apos;
The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill-used . Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further ; she turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears .
Clare was relieved at this change , for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself . He waited patiently , apathetically , till the violence of her grief had worn itself out , and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals .
&apos;Angel , &apos; she said suddenly , in her natural tones , the insane , dry voice of terror having left her now . &apos; Angel , am I too wicked for you and me to live together ? &apos;
&apos;I have not been able to think what we can do.&apos;
&apos;I shan &apos;t ask you to let me live with you , Angel , because I have no right to ! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married , as I said I would do ; and I shan &apos;t finish the good-hussif I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings.&apos;
&apos;Shan &apos;t you ? &apos;
&apos;No , I shan &apos;t do anything , unless you order me to ; and if you go away from me I shall not follow &apos; ee ; and if you never speak to me any more I shall not ask why , unless you tell me I may.&apos;
&apos;And if I do order you to do anything ? &apos;
&apos;I will obey you like your wretched slave , even if it is to lie down and die.&apos;
&apos;You are very good . But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past mood of self-preservation.&apos;
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife . However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
&quot; My dear Mr. Bennet , &quot; said his lady to him one day , &quot; have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? &quot;
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not .
&quot; But it is , &quot; returned she ; &quot; for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . &quot;
Mr. Bennet made no answer .
&quot; Do not you want to know who has taken it ? &quot; cried his wife impatiently .
&quot; You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . &quot;
This was invitation enough .
Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .
What is his name ?
Is he married or single ?
&quot; Oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! &quot;
&quot; How so ? how can it affect them ? &quot;
&quot; My dear Mr. Bennet , &quot; replied his wife , &quot; how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . &quot;
&quot; Is that his design in settling here ? &quot;
&quot; Design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . &quot;
&quot; I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for , as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . &quot;
My dear , you flatter me .
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley . He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . It was then disclosed in the following manner . Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , &quot; I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . &quot;
&quot; We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes , &quot; said her mother resentfully , &quot; since we are not to visit . &quot;
&quot; But you forget , mama , &quot; said Elizabeth , &quot; that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . &quot;
&quot; I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . &quot;
&quot; No more have I , &quot; said Mr. Bennet ; &quot; and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . &quot;
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .
&quot; Don &apos;t keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven &apos;s sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . &quot;
&quot; Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , &quot; said her father ; &quot; she times them ill . &quot;
&quot; I do not cough for my own amusement , &quot; replied Kitty fretfully .
When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ?
&quot; Aye , so it is , &quot; cried her mother , &quot; and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . &quot;
Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to her .
Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ?
&quot; I honour your circumspection . A fortnight &apos;s acquaintance is certainly very little . One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . &quot;
The girls stared at their father . Mrs. Bennet said only , &quot; Nonsense , nonsense ! &quot;
&quot; What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? &quot; cried he .
Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?
I cannot quite agree with you there .
What say you , Mary ?
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts .
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .
&quot; While Mary is adjusting her ideas , &quot; he continued , &quot; let us return to Mr. Bingley . &quot;
&quot; I am sick of Mr. Bingley , &quot; cried his wife .
I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ?
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .
How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet !
But I knew I should persuade you at last .
I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .
Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .
&quot; Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , &quot; said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .
&quot; What an excellent father you have , girls , &quot; said she , when the door was shut . &quot; I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . &quot;
&quot; Oh ! &quot; said Lydia stoutly , &quot; I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I &apos;m the tallest . &quot;
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet &apos;s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .
Angel sat down , and the place felt like home ; yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there .
Every time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence , and since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than usual .
Its transcendental aspirations - still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things , a zenithal paradise , a nadiral hell - were as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet .
Latterly he had seen only Life , felt only the great passionate pulse of existence , unwarped , uncontorted , untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate .
On their part they saw a great difference in him , a growing divergence from the Angel Clare of former times .
It was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now , particularly bis brothers .
He was getting to behave like a farmer ; he flung his legs about ; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive ; his eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke , and more .
The manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared ; still more the manner of the drawing-room young man .
A prig would have said that he had lost culture , and a prude that he had become coarse .
Such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains .
After breakfast he walked with his two brothers , non-evangelical , well-educated , hall-marked young men , correct to their remotest fibre ; such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a systematic tuition .
They were both somewhat shortsighted , and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string ; when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass ; when it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway , all without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own vision .
When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies ; and when Shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on their shelves .
When Correggio &apos;s Holy Families were admired , they admired Correggio &apos;s Holy Families ; when he was decried in favour of Velasquez , they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection .
If these two noticed Angel &apos;s growing social ineptness , he noticed their growing mental limitations .
Felix seemed to him all Church ; Cuthbert all College .
His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the main-springs of the world to the one ; Cambridge to the other .
Each brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant scores of millions of outsiders in civilized society , persons who were neither University men nor churchmen ; but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected .
They were both dutiful and attentive sons , and were regular in their visits to their parents .
Felix , though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devolution of theology than his father , was less self-sacrificing and disinterested .
More tolerant than his father of a contradictory opinion , in its aspect as a danger to its holder , he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching .
Cuthbert was , upon the whole , the more liberal-minded , though , with greater subtlety , he had not so much heart .
&apos;I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now , my dear fellow , &apos; Felix was saying , among other things , to his youngest brother , as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity .
And , therefore , we must make the best of it .
But I do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals .
Farming , of course , means roughing it externally ; but high thinking may go with plain living , nevertheless .
&apos;Of course it may , &apos; said Angel . &apos; Was it not proved nineteen hundred years ago - if I may trespass upon your domain a little ? Why should you think , Felix , that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals ? &apos;
&apos;Well , I fancied , from the tone of your letters and our conversation - It may be fancy only - that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp . Hasn &apos;t it struck you , Cuthbert ? &apos;
Now , Felix , said Angel drily ,
we are very good friends , you know ; each of us treading our allotted circles ;
but if it comes to intellectual grasp , I think you , as a contented dogmatist , had better leave mine alone , and inquire what has become of yours .
They returned down the hill to dinner , which was fixed at any time at which their father &apos;s and mother &apos;s morning work in the parish usually concluded .
Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare ; though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions .
The walk had made them hungry , Angel in particular , who was now an outdoor man , accustomed to the profuse dapes inemptae of the dairyman &apos;s somewhat coarsely-laden table .
But neither of the old people had arrived , and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their parents entered . The self-denying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners , whom they , somewhat inconsistently , tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh , their own appetites being quite forgotten .
The family sat down to table , and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them .
Angel looked round for Mrs Crick &apos;s black-puddings , which he had directed to be nicely grilled , as they did them at the dairy , and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself .
&apos;Of course , &apos; said Angel cheerfully , looking round for the mead .
&apos;I found the mead so extremely alcoholic , &apos; continued his mother , &apos; that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage , but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency ; so I have put it in my medicine-closet.&apos;
&apos;We never drink spirits at this table , on principle , &apos; added his father .
&apos;But what shall I tell the dairyman &apos;s wife ? &apos; said Angel .
&apos;The truth , of course , &apos; said his father .
&apos;I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the blackpuddings very much . She is a kind , jolly sort of body , and is sure to ask me directly I return.&apos;
&apos;You cannot , if we did not , &apos; Mr Clare answered lucidly .
&apos;AH - no ; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.&apos;
&apos;A what ? &apos; said Cuthbert and Felix both .
&apos;Oh-- &apos; tis an expression they use down at Talbothays , &apos; replied Angel , blushing . He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment , and said no more .
Clare , restless , went out into the dusk when evening drew on , she who had won him having retired to her chamber .
The night was as sultry as the day .
There was no coolness after dark unless on the grass .
Roads , garden-paths , the house-fronts , the barton-walls were warm as hearths , and reflected the noontide temperature into the noctambulist &apos;s face .
He sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard , and knew not what to think of himself .
Feeling had indeed smothered judgment that day .
Since the sudden embrace , three hours before , the twain had kept apart .
She seemed stilled , almost alarmed , at what had occurred , while the novelty , unpremeditation , mastery of circumstance disquieted him - palpitating , contemplative being that he was .
He could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet , and what their mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward .
Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary existence here was to be the merest episode in his life , soon passed through and early forgotten ; he had come as to a place from which as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world without , and , apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman--
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes , How curious you are to me !
resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew .
But , behold , the absorbing scene had been imported hither .
What had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show ; while here , in this apparently dim and un-impassioned place , novelty had volcanically started up , as it had never , for him , started up elsewhere .
This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic First Cause - her all ; her every and only chance .
To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun .
Living in such close relations , to meet meant to fall into endearment ; flesh and blood could not resist it ; and , having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency , he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged .
As yet the harm done was small . But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her .
He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse .
He thought he would go and see his friends .
It might be possible to sound them upon this .
In less than five months his term here would have ended , and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge , and in a position to start on his own account .
Would not a farmer want a wife , and should a farmer &apos;s wife be a drawing-room wax-figure , or a woman who understood farming ?
Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence he resolved to go his journey .
One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day .
&apos;O no , &apos; said Dairyman Crick . &apos; Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi &apos; his kinsfolk.&apos;
For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke , and the birds muffled their song .
But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness .
&apos;He &apos;s getting on towards the end of his time wi &apos; me , &apos; added the dairyman , with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal ;
and so I suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere .
Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease :
and now , as they again confronted him , clothed with colour and life , they sent an aura over his flesh , a breeze through his nerves , which wellnigh produced a qualm ;
and actually produced , by some mysterious physiological process , a prosaic sneeze .
She then became conscious that he was observing her ;
but she would not show it by any change of position , though the curious dream-like fixity disappeared , and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened , and then faded till only a tinge of it was left .
The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down .
Resolutions , reticences , prudences , fears , fell back like a defeated battalion .
He lumped up from his seat , and , leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind , went quickly towards the desire of his eyes , and , kneeling down beside her , clasped her in his arms .
Tess was taken completely by surprise , and she yielded to his embrace with unreflecting inevitableness .
Having seen that it was really her lover who had advanced , and no one else , her lips parted , and she sank upon him in her momentary joy , with something very like an ecstatic cry .
He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth , but he checked himself , for tender conscience &apos; sake .
&apos;Forgive me , Tess dear ! &apos; he whispered .
I ought to have asked .
I - did not know what I was doing .
I do not mean it as a liberty .
I am devoted to you , Tessy , dearest , in all sincerity ! &apos;
Old Pretty by this time had looked round , puzzled ;
and seeing two people crouching under her where , by immemorial custom , there should have been only one , lifted her hind leg crossly .
&apos;She is angry - she doesn &apos;t know what we mean - she &apos;ll kick over the milk ! &apos; exclaimed Tess , gently striving to free herself , her eyes concerned with the quadruped &apos;s actions , her heart more deeply concerned with herself and Clare .
She slipped up from her seat , and they stood together , his arm still encircling her .
Tess &apos;s eyes , fixed on distance , began to fill .
&apos;Why do you cry , my darling ? &apos; he said .
&apos;O - I don &apos;t know ! &apos; she murmured .
As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw .
&apos;Well , I have betrayed my feeling , Tess , at last , &apos; said he , with a curious sigh of desperation , signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgment .
&apos;That I - love you dearly and truly I need not say . But I - it shall go no further now - it distresses you - I am as surprised as you are . You will not think I have presumed upon your defencelessness - been too quick and unreflecting , will you ? &apos;
&apos;N &apos; - I can &apos;t tell.&apos;
&quot; In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . &quot;
&quot; But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; It is more than I engage for , I assure you . &quot;
But consider your daughters .
I desire you will do no such thing .
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .
But you are always giving her the preference .
&quot; They have none of them much to recommend them , &quot; replied he ; &quot; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . &quot;
&quot; You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . &quot;
&quot; Ah ! you do not know what I suffer . &quot;
&quot; But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; It will be no use to us if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . &quot;
&quot; Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty I will visit them all . &quot;
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .
Her mind was less difficult to develope .
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . When she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous .
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .
&apos;Never mind that , &apos; she coaxed .
&apos;Put me down , I beg you . I don &apos;t mind where it is ; only let me get down , sir , please ! &apos;
She accepted these terms , and slid off on the near side , though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss .
He sprang down on the other side .
&apos;I suppose I must hold the horse ? &apos; said she .
&apos;Oh no ; it &apos;s not necessary , &apos; replied Alec , patting the panting creature . &apos; He &apos;s had enough of it for to-night.&apos;
He turned the horse &apos;s head into the bushes , hitched him on to a bough , and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves .
&apos;Now , you sit there , &apos; he said .
The leaves have not got damp as yet .
Just give an eye to the horse - it will be quite sufficient.&apos;
He took a few steps away from her , but , returning , said , &apos; By the bye , Tess , your father has a new cob to-day . Somebody gave it to him.&apos;
&apos;Somebody ? You ! &apos;
D &apos;Urberville nodded .
&apos;O how very good of you that is ! &apos; she exclaimed , with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then .
And the children have some toys.&apos;
&apos;I didn &apos;t know - you ever sent them anything ! &apos; she murmured , much moved . &apos; I almost wish you had not - yes , I almost wish it ! &apos;
&apos;Why , dear ? &apos;
&apos;It - hampers me so.&apos;
&apos;Tessy - don &apos;t you love me ever so little now ? &apos;

My talk is &quot; Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes . &quot;
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
It ties to origami .
So let me start .
What is origami ?
Most people think they know what origami is .
It &apos;s this : flapping birds , toys , cootie catchers , that sort of thing .
And that is what origami used to be .
But it &apos;s become something else .
It &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding , is how we create the form .
You know , it &apos;s very old .
This is a plate from 1797 .
It shows these women playing with these toys .
If you look close , it &apos;s this shape , called a crane .
Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane .
So this art has been around for hundreds of years , and you would think something that &apos;s been around that long -- so restrictive , folding only -- everything that could done has been done a long time ago .
And that might have been the case .
But in the 20th century , a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along , and he created tens of thousands of new designs .
But even more importantly , he created a language -- a way we could communicate , a code of dots , dashes and arrows .
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore &apos;s talk , we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection , and we know where that leads .
And where it has led in origami is to things like this .
This is an origami figure : one sheet , no cuts , folding only , hundreds of folds .
This too is origami , and this shows where we &apos;ve gone in the modern world .
You can get horns , antlers -- even if you look close , cloven hooves .
And it raises a question : what changed ?
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
That is , people applied mathematical principles to the art , to discover the underlying laws .
And that leads to a very powerful tool .
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you .
Because what you can do is take your problem and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved , and use their solutions .
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami .
Origami revolves around crease patterns .
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure .
And you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
They have to obey four simple laws .
And they &apos;re very simple , easy to understand .
The first law is two-colorability .
You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting .
The directions of the folds at any vertex --the number of mountain folds , the number of valley folds --always differs by two .
Two more or two less .
Nothing else .
If you look at the angles around the fold , you find that if you number the angles in a circle , all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line .
All the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line .
And if you look at how the layers stack , you &apos;ll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets , a sheet can never penetrate a fold .
So that &apos;s four simple laws .
That &apos;s all you need in origami .
All of origami comes from that .
And you &apos;d think , &quot; Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity ? &quot;
But indeed , the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin , and yet they govern all of chemistry , all of life , all of history .
If we obey these laws , we can do amazing things .
So in origami , to obey these laws , we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds , called textures -- and by itself it &apos;s nothing .
But if we follow the laws of origami , we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very , very simple , but when we put it together , we get something a little different .
This fish , 400 scales -- again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
And if you don &apos;t want to fold 400 scales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a turtle , or toes .
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag , with 13 stripes .
And if you want to go really crazy , 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake .
And this guy &apos;s on display downstairs , so take a look if you get a chance .
The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures .
And I can put it in this simple equation .
We take an idea , combine it with a square , and you get an origami figure .
What matters is what we mean by those symbols .
And you might say , &quot; Can you really be that specific ?
I mean , a stag beetle -- it &apos;s got two points for jaws , it &apos;s got antennae . Can you be that specific in the detail ? &quot;
And yeah , you really can .
So how do we do that ?
Well , we break it down into a few smaller steps .
So let me stretch out that equation .
I start with my idea . I abstract it .
What &apos;s the most abstract form ? It &apos;s a stick figure .
And from that stick figure , I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject .
A flap for every leg .
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base , you can make the legs narrower , you can bend them , you can turn it into the finished shape .
Now the first step : pretty easy .
Take an idea , draw a stick figure .
The last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that &apos;s hard .
But that &apos;s the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump .
And I &apos;m going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something .
But we &apos;re going to start small .
This base has a lot of flaps in it .
We &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
How would you make a single flap ?
Take a square . Fold it in half , fold it in half , fold it again , until it gets long and narrow , and then we &apos;ll say at the end of that , that &apos;s a flap .
I could use that for a leg , an arm , anything like that .
What paper went into that flap ?
Well , if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern , you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap .
So that &apos;s the flap , and all the rest of the paper &apos;s left over .
I can use it for something else .
Well , there &apos;s other ways of making a flap .
There &apos;s other dimensions for flaps .
If I make the flaps skinnier , I can use a bit less paper .
If I make the flap as skinny as possible , I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed .
And you can see there , it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap .
There &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
If I put the flap on the edge , it uses a half circle of paper .
And if I make the flap from the middle , it uses a full circle .
So no matter how I make a flap , it needs some part of a circular region of paper .
So now we &apos;re ready to scale up .
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps ?
What do I need ?
I need a lot of circles .
And in the 1990s , origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles .
And here &apos;s where the dead people start to help us out .
Because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles .
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements .
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles , you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules .
That gives you the folds .
Those folds fold into a base .
You shape the base .
You get a folded shape -- in this case , a cockroach .
And it &apos;s so simple .
It &apos;s so simple that a computer could do it .
And you say , &quot; Well , you know , how simple is that ? &quot;
But computers , you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms , and with this we could .
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker , and you can download it from my website .
It &apos;s free .
It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows .
And you just draw a stick figure , and it calculates the crease pattern .
It does the circle packing , calculates the crease pattern , and if you use that stick figure that I just showed , which you can kind of tell -- it &apos;s a deer , it &apos;s got antlers -- you &apos;ll get this crease pattern .
And if you take this crease pattern , you fold on the dotted lines , you &apos;ll get a base that you can then shape into a deer , with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted .
And if you want a different deer , not a white-tailed deer , you change the packing , and you can do an elk .
Or you could do a moose .
Or really , any other kind of deer .
These techniques revolutionized this art .
We found we could do insects , spiders , which are close -- things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and antennae .
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn &apos;t interesting enough , then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square .
She &apos;s eating him .
I call it &quot; Snack Time . &quot;
And you can do more than just insects .
This -- you can put details : toes and claws .
A grizzly bear has claws .
This tree frog has toes .
Actually , lots of people in origami now put toes into their models .
Toes have become an origami meme .
Because everyone &apos;s doing it .
You can make multiple subjects .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
The guitar player from a single square , the bass player from a single square .
And if you say , &quot; Well , but the guitar , bass -- that &apos;s not so hot .
Do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
Well , then you could do an organ .
And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand .
So now people can say , I want exactly this and this and this , and you can go out and fold it .
And sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work .
But I want to show you some examples .
Everything you &apos;ll see here , except the car , is origami .
Just to show you , this really was folded paper .
Computers made things move , but these were all real folded objects that we made .
And we can use this not just for visuals , but it turns out to be useful even in the real world .
Surprisingly , origami , and the structures that we &apos;ve developed in origami , turn out to have applications in medicine , in science , in space , in the body , consumer electronics and more .
And I want to show you some of these examples .
One of the earliest was this pattern : this folded pattern , studied by Koryo Miura , a Japanese engineer .
He studied a folding pattern , and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure .
And he used it to design this solar array .
It &apos;s an artist &apos;s rendition , but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995 .
Now , there is actually a little origami in the James Webb space telescope , but it &apos;s very simple .
The telescope -- going up in space , it unfolds in two places .
It folds in thirds .
It &apos;s a very simple pattern -- you wouldn &apos;t even call that origami .
They certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this , then you might need some origami .
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger .
They called it &quot; The Eyeglass . &quot;
The design called for geosynchronous orbit , 26,000 miles up , 100-meter diameter lens .
So , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
There were two groups of people who were interested in this : planetary scientists who want to look up , and then other people who wanted to look down .
Whether you look up or look down , how do you get it up in space ?
You &apos;ve got to get it up there in a rocket .
And rockets are small .
So you have to make it smaller .
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ?
Well , about the only way is to fold it up somehow .
So you have to do something like this -- this was a small model .
For the lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures .
But this pattern &apos;s not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .
So the Livermore engineers , wanting to make use of the work of dead people , or perhaps live origamists , said , &quot; Let &apos;s see if someone else is doing this sort of thing . &quot;
So they looked into the origami community , we got in touch with them , and I started working with them .
And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size , but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat , compact cylinder .
And they adopted that for their first generation , which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter .
But this is a five-meter telescope -- has about a quarter-mile focal length .
And it works perfectly on its test range , and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle .
Now , there is other origami in space .
The problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey .
And that works whether you &apos;re going into space , or whether you &apos;re just going into a body .
And this example is the latter .
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University .
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination , but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there , through your blood vessels .
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern , based on a model called the water-bomb base .
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space .
And they want to do their design by simulation .
So they need to figure out how , in a computer , to flatten an airbag .
And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation .
And so they can do a simulation like this .
Those are the origami creases forming , and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out : does it work ?
And that leads to a really interesting idea .
You know , where did these things come from ?
Well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school .
It &apos;s the same pattern , called &quot; the water-bomb base . &quot;
The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs .
The thing is , that this often happens in math and science .
When you get math involved , problems that you solve for aesthetic value only , or to create something beautiful , turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world .
And as weird and surprising as it may sound , origami may someday even save a life .
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
These are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
If you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
It &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
And it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
So , we have this ability as well .
And in humans , we call it the body clock .
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
So , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
And so , in this way , we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
So fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
It &apos;s a huge driver for culture , and I think that it &apos;s the most underrated force on our behavior .
We evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
But of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe , and in Arctic Canada , where I live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
So the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
In winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on .
You enjoy your family life inside .
And in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ?
Well , it turns out that , when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
They go to bed around 8 : 00 pm .
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 am until sunrise .
And in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
And during this time , there &apos;s a surge of prolactin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .
So , cut to the modern day .
We &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
And , you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but I believe we should understand the costs .
It can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
And it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task .
But what I &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that I think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
And those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
And I &apos;m going to start with this one .
If momma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
We know that , right ? We &apos;ve experienced that .
And if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
That &apos;s the theme of my Talk .
And we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932 .
Cannery Row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
Rolf Bolin , who was a professor at the Hopkin &apos;s Marine Station where I work , wrote in the 1940s that , &quot; The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . &quot;
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell .
But you know what they came out saying ?
They say , &quot; You know what you smell ?
You smell money . &quot;
That pollution was money to that community .
And those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
We made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages .
And I want to call that &quot; pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . &quot;
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now ... when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean .
Because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
We see the base of the food chain , the plankton the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
And that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; Save the ocean . Heal the ocean . &quot;
It &apos;s that pyramid .
Now why does that matter for human health ?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very frightening things happen .
Pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us , molecules like PCBs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
And they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up , they &apos;re passed up that way , on to predators and on to the top predators .
And in so doing , they accumulate .
Now , to bring that home , I thought I &apos;d invent a little game .
We don &apos;t really have to play it . We can just think about it here .
It &apos;s the Styrofoam and chocolate game .
Imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts .
Can &apos;t do much with them but put them in your pocket .
Because the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too .
What &apos;ll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here .
And they will accumulate in the drunkest stingiest people .
There &apos;s no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts .
And that &apos;s exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid .
They accumulate into the top of it .
Now suppose instead of Styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
Well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around .
And instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group .
Because they &apos;re absorbed by us .
And that &apos;s the difference between a PCB and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
PCBs accumulate .
We have great examples of that , unfortunately .
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay , in Texas , in North Carolina .
They get into the food chain .
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton , and those PCBs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
Now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin .
And what &apos;s that ?
In mother &apos;s milk .
Here &apos;s a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota bay .
Adult males , a huge load .
Juveniles , a huge load .
Females after their first calf is already weaned , a lower load .
Those females , they &apos;re not trying to .
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring .
And their offspring don &apos;t survive .
The death rate in these in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant .
And most of them die .
Now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first born calf .
There &apos;s another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
That top predator , of course , is us .
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo -- or is it ?
In fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
Some of them were illegal whale meat , by the way .
That &apos;s another story .
But some of them were not whale meat at all .
Even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
Some of them were dolphin liver . Some of them were dolphin blubber .
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs , dioxins and heavy metals .
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
That &apos;s a tragedy for those populations .
But it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
We had these data a few years ago .
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA .
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; Well , I know this . This is a great scientific discovery . &quot;
But it was so awful .
And for the very first time in my scientific career I broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals , and then begin to talk about them .
We sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of Japan .
Because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan .
And I &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in Japan that &apos;s labeled incorrectly , even though they &apos;re still selling whale meat , which I believe they shouldn &apos;t .
But at least it &apos;s labeled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
It isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic , a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
These women have toxic breast milk .
They cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
That means their immune systems are compromised .
It means that their children &apos;s development can be compromised .
And the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyramid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
We &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
That &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
There &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
The pyramid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a sewer line that &apos;s clogged .
And if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that pyramid , it can back up all through it .
And we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red tides for example , which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage .
We can also get blooms of bacteria , blooms of viruses in the ocean .
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
How many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
Why does that happen ?
It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches .
Often what jams us up is sewage .
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
Not very often . We wouldn &apos;t tolerate that .
We wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage .
But beaches are closed a lot in our country .
They &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason .
And I believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
It &apos;s not just a question of cleanliness .
It &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
These vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
They can go into your skin and create skin infections .
This is a graph from NOAA &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years .
Surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
And if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flashing poo alert .
That means that the beach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of surfing , this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve .
Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now .
And that makes them even more difficult .
These same infections create harmful algal blooms .
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish ciguatera , diarrhetic shellfish poisoning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning , paralytic shellfish poisoning .
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod .
Copepods are small crustaceans .
They &apos;re a tiny fraction of an inch long .
And they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
So what do you do ?
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
Well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
You could call Joe the Plumber , for example .
And he could come in and fix the flow .
But in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fixed , where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around .
Monterey is one of those .
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
In 1932 that &apos;s the picture .
In 2009 the picture is dramatically different .
The canneries are gone . The pollution has abated .
But there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top .
And that pyramid in Monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it &apos;s ever functioned for the last 150 years .
It didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
On the left there , Julia Platt , the mayor of my little home town in Pacific Grove .
At 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
In 1931 , she produced California &apos;s first community-based marine protected area , right next to the the biggest polluting cannery because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed .
And she wanted to provide that seed .
Other people David Packard and Julie Packard , who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay , but other places around the world .
Well , I want to leave you with the thought that , what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid .
And that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
It &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves terrestrial species .
But the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
And it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
Thank you very much .
The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation .
And I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with .
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands .
And in scenic Switzerland for me .
I always had a passion for alternative vehicles .
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada .
Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there .
And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil that I built in my bedroom , much to the dismay of my mother .
To the dismay of my mother , this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .
And I brought this all together , this passion with alternative energy . And raced a solar car across Australia .
Also the U.S. and Japan .
So , wind power , solar power , we had a lot to talk about .
We had a lot that got us excited .
So we decided to do a special project together .
To combine engineering and design and ...
Really make a fully integrated product , something beautiful .
And we made a baby .
Can you bring out our baby ?
This baby is fully electric .
It goes 150 miles an hour .
It &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design .
It &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar .
He came up with our name and logo . We &apos;re Mission Motors .
And we &apos;ve only got three minutes .
But we could talk about it for hours .
Thank you TED . And thank you Chris , for having us .
I grew up in Europe , and World War II caught me when I was between seven and 10 years old .
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them -- how few of them could even resemble a normal , contented , satisfied , happy life once their job , their home , their security was destroyed by the war .
So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living .
And I tried , as a child , as a teenager , to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question .
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance .
Actually I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself , because the snow had melted and there was -- I didn &apos;t have money to go to a movie , but I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Zurich , and it was about flying saucers he was going to talk .
And I thought , well , since I can &apos;t go to the movies , at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers .
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
And it -- actually , instead of talking about little green men , he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they &apos;re projecting flying saucers into the sky , kind of as a -- he talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war .
And this seemed very interesting to me .
And I started reading his books after that lecture .
And that was Carl Jung , whose name or work I had no idea about .
Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand these roots of happiness .
This is a typical result that many people have presented , and there are many variations on it .
But this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy .
And that hasn &apos;t changed at all .
Whereas the personal income , on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation , has more than doubled , almost tripled , in that period .
But you find essentially the same results , namely , that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level , increases in material well-being don &apos;t seem to affect how happy people are .
And , in fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources do not increase happiness .
So my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , I tried to understand now , where in everyday life , in our normal experience , do we feel really happy .
And to start that -- those studies about 40 years ago , I began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expect either fame or fortune , but which made their life meaningful and worth doing .
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the &apos; 70s .
And the interview was 40 pages long .
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview .
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well .
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state .
Now ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something .
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines .
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality .
And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it &apos;s China , Greece , Hindu civilization , or the Mayas , or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life .
We know the temples they built so -- where people could come to experience a different reality .
We know about the circuses , the arenas , the theaters -- these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated , more ordered form .
Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also -- this place , this arena , which is built like a Greek amphitheatre , is a place for ecstasy also .
We are participating in a reality which is different from that of everyday life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go to there .
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks , and as he does that , he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination .
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create -- like Jennifer did in her improvisation -- a new reality , that is a moment of ecstasy .
He enters that different reality .
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn &apos;t exist .
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration .
But actually , our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second .
And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
Well , when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new , as this man does , he doesn &apos;t have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels , or his problems at home .
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hungry or tired .
His body disappears , his identity disappears from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists .
So existence is temporarily suspended .
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any awe or wonder , because I can &apos;t compose .
So what is that telling you here , but in other parts of the interview is that obviously this automatic , spontaneous process that he &apos;s describing can only happen to someone who is very well-trained and who has developed technique .
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can &apos;t be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field .
Whether it &apos;s mathematics or music -- it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
Now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out .
And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the &quot; flow experience . &quot;
And it happens in different realms .
For instance , a poet describes it in this form .
This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States .
And it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats up in the sky -- very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked .
But it happens in other activities .
For instance , this is another student of mine , Susan Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater , the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person .
You don &apos;t think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music , and so forth .
It happens also , actually , in the most recent book I wrote , called &quot; Good Business , &quot; where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical , very socially responsible .
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things to be successful .
If you want a meaningful job and successful job -- Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed .
She is the founder of Body Shop , the cosmetic , kind of natural cosmetic king .
It &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka , who was , at that time , starting out Sony without any money , without a product -- they didn &apos;t have a product , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea .
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart &apos;s content .
I couldn &apos;t improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace .
Now , when we do studies , we have , with other colleagues around the world , done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks , to blind nuns , to Himalayan climbers , to Navajo shepherds -- who enjoy their work .
And regardless of the culture , regardless of education or whatever , there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow .
There &apos;s this focus that once it becomes intense , leads to a sense of ecstasy , a sense of clarity , you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other , you get immediate feedback .
You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
And once those conditions are present , what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake .
In our studies , we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme .
And we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about .
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skills that they feel they have at that moment .
So for each person we can establish an average , which is the center of the diagram .
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill , which will be different from that of anybody else .
But you have a kind of a set point there which would be in the middle .
If we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average .
And you may be doing things very differently from other people , but for everyone that flow channel , that area there , will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano , probably , be with your best friend , perhaps work , if work is what provides flow for you .
And then the other areas become less and less positive .
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there .
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill .
So , arousal is the area where most people learn from , because that &apos;s where they &apos;re pushed beyond their comfort zone and that to enter -- going back to flow -- then they develop higher skills .
Control is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfortable , but not very excited .
It &apos;s not very challenging any more .
And if you want to enter flow from control , you have to increase the challenges .
So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into .
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK .
Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative -- you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your skills , there &apos;s no challenge .
Unfortunately , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in apathy .
The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television , the next one is being in the bathroom , sitting .
And then , even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
So the question we are trying to address -- and I &apos;m way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice , but unfortunately a lot of people don &apos;t .
And that &apos;s what our mandate is in a way to do . OK .
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
And in doing that , I want to offer you a vision , an imagined future , if you will , of how , as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it , &quot; Once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history rhyme . &quot;
I want to start with these word pairs here .
We all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themsevles on the wrong side of these either .
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk-averse .
And in fact they weren &apos;t . They were reinventing charity in those times .
What Rockefeller called &quot; The business of benevolence . &quot;
But by the end of the twentieth century , a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way .
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about , and that &apos;s exactly what is happening , is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions .
For philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
And it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , by new pressures .
I &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
This report is our main public report .
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you .
And as I do that , I &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about , the Gates and the Soros and the Google .
Instead , what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us .
The democratization of philanthropy .
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
What I &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
The first is mass collaboration , represented here by Wikipedia .
Now , this may surprise you .
But remember , philanthropy is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
Clay Shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
He said , &quot; We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
Now we have Wikipedia .
Suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
Watch , this spring , for Paul Hawken &apos;s new book .
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about .
The book is called &quot; Blessed Unrest . &quot;
And when it comes out , a series of wiki sites under the label WISER , are going to launch at the same time .
WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility .
WISER sets out to document , link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement and fastest growing movement in human history .
Humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .
Now , all of these big things for love experiments aren &apos;t going to take off .
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of philanthropy in human history .
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces .
This is , of course , to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce .
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
And this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
Take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at DonorsChoose .
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose .
It &apos;s one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
Take a look at Changing the Present , started by a TEDster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
And it goes on and on .
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet , which I call aggregated giving .
It &apos;s not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
It &apos;s that he challenged another assumption , that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
There are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
One of the best known is Acumen Fund , led by Jacqueline Novogratz , a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED .
But there are many others . New Profit in Cambridge , New School &apos;s Venture Fund in Silicon Valley , Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington , Global Fund for Women in San Francisco .
Take a look at these .
These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing .
But with a twist , because often a community forms around these funds , as it has at Acumen and other places .
Now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments , mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving .

The ‘ wave ’ properties of macroscopic matter are not apparent because the wavelength is undetectably small .
The book remains at rest or , in physical terminology , in static equilibrium not because there are no forces acting on it but because the forces which do act on it annul one another .
As no machine ever runs without some friction , overcoming the force wastes work .
Since the operator had more experience with mounting tape than a programmer , setup time was reduced .
As friction is always present , it naturally causes losses in all types of machines , since because of friction ; part of useful mechanical energy is lost in the form of useless heat .

On the average the continental shelf is about 70 km wide . One much of the Pacific Coast it is relatively narrows , only a few tens of kilometers across .
During the course of a freezing season , sea ice may form at the surface up to thickness of 2 meters at the high latitudes .
In typical cases the zone is about 3000 ft ( 1 km ) in depth and 100 miles ( 100-200 km ) in width , with a slop of approximately 1 / 100 .
ONE of the oddest things about Homo sapiens is that he is alone .
Though storytellers have filled the world with imaginary hominids-from woodland pixies to mountain giants-no sign of the real thing has ever been seen .
But that was not true in the past .
As recently as 40,000 years ago there were three other species of human on Earth : Neanderthals in Europe , the &quot; hobbits &quot; of Flores , in Indonesia , and a recently discovered and still mysterious group of creatures called the Denisovans , who lived in Central Asia .
And now there is evidence that similar diversity existed earlier in human history , a little under 2m years ago , in Africa .
This evidence , just published in Nature , has been provided by a team led by Meave Leakey of the Turkana Basin Institute in Nairobi , Kenya . Dr Leakey is a member of an illustrious palaeontological clan .
The problem with studying humanity &apos;s fossil record is that it is so sparse : a jawbone here ; a braincase there .
Often , it is difficult to know if different bones have come from the same species or not .
Even multiple examples of the same type of bone can mislead . What looks like two species might actually be the male and the female of one .
Such confusion has bedevilled the interpretation of the human fossils found near Lake Turkana .
Some palaeontologists see a single , variable species called Homo habilis .
The new fossils found by Dr Leakey and her team ( which includes a third Leakey generation in the form of her daughter , Louise ) may , however , help clear up what is going on .
One of the new specimens , known as KMN-ER 62000 , has a face like the type specimen of Homo rudolfensis ( the fossil that defines the species , if species it turns out to be ) , though it seems to be from an adolescent , whereas the type specimen is an adult .
Crucially , 62000 has a reasonably well-preserved upper jaw , which the type specimen lacks .
A computer reconstruction ( see diagram ) suggests this upper jaw meshes well with the second of Dr Leakey &apos;s discoveries , a lower jaw ( KMN-ER 60000 ) .
She is not suggesting they are from the same individual , since they are of different ages , but they seem to come from the same species , namely Homo rudolfensis .
Equally significantly , a different computer reconstruction shows that the upper jaw of 62000 does not match another famous fossil from the area , known as KMN-ER 1802 .
This was found in 1973 and had previously been thought likely to be the lower jaw of rudolfensis .
What 1802 actually is , is now obscure .
It is too different from what this chain of reasoning suggests was the shape of Homo rudolfensis to be explained by sexual dimorphism , unless the sexes differed in this species in ways not seen in any other primate .
But its previous attribution was made because it does not look much like Homo habilis either .
It seems then that at least two , and possibly three species of Homo were stalking the east-African savannah a little under 2m years ago : habilis , rudolfensis and something as yet unnamed .
The intertwining history of the human family and the Leakey family has just become even more complicated .
Watching a film that makes you laugh is good for your heart , according to a study .
Researchers found watching a movie or programme that produces laughter has a positive effect on vascular function and is opposite to that observed after watching a war or horror film that causes mental stress 。
In the study volunteers watched segments of a funny film - such as There &apos;s Something About Mary starring Cameron Diaz - on one day and on another day watched the opening segment of the stressful war film Saving Private Ryan 。
Lead investigator Dr Michael Miller from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the U.S. said that when the volunteers watched the stressful film , their blood vessel lining developed a potentially unhealthy response called vasoconstriction , reducing blood flow . He said this finding confirms previous studies , which suggested there was a link between mental stress and the narrowing of blood vessels 。
However , after watching the funny movie , the blood vessel lining expanded . Overall , more than 300 measurements were made with a 30 to 50 per cent difference in blood vessel diameter between the laughter and mental stress phases . Dr Miller said : &apos; The take-home message here is that laughter is great for your heart 。
The time of year a baby is born can shape what profession they will embark on in later life , a new study has suggested 。
Being born in a certain month appears to indicate the statistical likelihood of what job a person will end up with , the study by the Office for National Statistics found 。
Researchers have uncovered that the month in which babies are born could also affect everything from intelligence to length of life 。
A child born December is more likely to become a dentist while someone whose birthday falls in January will tend to a debt collector , they found 。
A February birth appears to increase the chances of being an artist while March babies appear to go on to become pilots 。
Meanwhile , April and May are said to have a fairly even spread of professions , births in the summer months mean a much lower chance of becoming a high-earning football player , doctor or dentist 。
The study was derived by researchers who analysed the birth months of people in 19 separate occupations using information from the last census , the Daily Mail reported 。
Although these trends may be difficult to explain , correlations between birth months and specific health problems have a scientific basis 。
Spring babies are at greater risk of illnesses including schizophrenia , Alzheimer ’ s disease , asthma and autism 。
They may also be less clever than classmates born in other parts of the year 。
Many people say that they probably came to this planet and altered our DNA and other genetic forms while we were still primitives ?
Where do humans get all technology from ?
and how about those crop circles all around the world ?
Surely we are not alone , but I think they are good beings because if they were evil they would had eliminated us from along time ago , ( with all the technology they posses )
Also our ancestors were devoted to some strange gods , building pyramids and all that stuff just to please them .
There is evidence of Egyptians and Mayans drawings of little men pointing to the moon with suits and shuttles .
How come they knew so much about astronomy at that time ?
It &apos;s not believable that we come from chimpazees .
If that were true where does white and chinese people come from .
They don &apos;t look anything alike to those creatures .
How come humans know the age of our planet we are talking about billions and that number is not small .
Supposedly we didn &apos;t exist back then .
What an enigma !
According to the effects of colors on the human body and emotions , certain colors are selected to exert direct effects on the mind and emotions via eyes .
This is the so-called pleasing the eyes and refreshing the mind .
Besides , the color tones , color temperatures , etc. may also be used to regulate emotions 。
The method , under the guidance of the theory of &quot; the five colors corresponding to the five zang organs and five emotions &quot; , is used to arrange the colors of the patient &apos;s living surroundings such as living rooms , utensils , furnishings , clothes , quilts , window curtains and lights as well as the dresses of doctors and nurses of rehabilitation according to the requirements .
Colors and their indications are as follows 。
Warm colors
Red and orange , with warm feeling , possess the actions of making people excited and joyful .
The colors are applicable to depression , depressive psychosis , lethargy , dementia , etc 。
Cold colors
Among indigo blue , blue , purple and green have the actions of cooling , tranquilizing and making people restrained .
Cold colors are applicable to dysphoria , irascibility , insomnia , terror and fear as well as mania , epilepsy , etc 。
Joyful colors
Red and pink make people happy and have the action of restraining grief . The colors are applicable to people with low spirits , susceptibility to grief and cry ， and depression 。
Sad colors
Black is mainly applied or white may also be used to restrict anger . Both colors are applicable to susceptibility to anger , overjoy , etc 。
Fearful color
Black has the action of restricting overjoy . The color is applicable to mania , endless laughing , etc 。
Anxious colors
Yellow , light blue and light green possess the actions of restricting fear and benefiting thinking . The colors are applicable to terror , fear , distraction , etc 。
Anger and other strong emotions can trigger potentially deadly heart rhythms in certain vulnerable people , US researchers said on Monday .
Previous studies have shown that earthquakes , war or even the loss of a World Cup Soccer match can increase rates of death from sudden cardiac arrest , in which the heart stops circulating blood .
&quot; It &apos;s definitely been shown in all different ways that when you put a whole population under a stressor that sudden death will increase , &quot; said Dr. Rachel Lampert of Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . &quot; Our study starts to look at how does this really affect the electrical system of the heart , &quot; Lampert said .
She and colleagues studied 62 patients with heart disease and implantable heart defibrillators or ICDs that can detect dangerous heart rhythms or arrhythmias and deliver an electrical shock to restore a normal heart beat .
&quot; These were people we know already had some vulnerability to arrhythmia , &quot; Lampert said in a telephone interview .
Patients in the study took part in an exercise in which they recounted a recent angry episode while Lampert &apos;s team did a test called T-Wave Alternans that measures electrical instability in the heart .
Lampert said the team specifically asked questions to get people to relive the angry episode .
&quot; We found in the lab setting that yes , anger did increase this electrical instability in these patients , &quot; she said .
Next , they followed patients for three years to see which patients later had a cardiac arrest and needed a shock from their implantable defibrillator .
&quot; The people who had the highest anger-induced electrical instability were 10 times more likely than everyone else to have an arrhythmia in follow-up , &quot; she said .
Lampert said the study suggests that anger can be deadly , at least for people who are already vulnerable to this type of electrical disturbance in the heart .
&quot; It says yes , anger really does impact the heart &apos;s electrical system in very specific ways that can lead to sudden death , &quot; she said .
Each and every one of us is responsible for the greenhouse gases we emit in our daily actions and choices .
Therefore , combating climate change is going to take the combined efforts of everyone on the planet .
The average household carbon footprint in China is 2.41 tons of carbon dioxide annually .
That &apos;s enough to fill half an Olympic swimming pool .
Surprised ? Well , here &apos;s how you can work to reduce it :
Take showers rather than baths and reduce your shower time by two minutes . This will save water and give you an extra two minutes in bed .
Don &apos;t purchase unnecessary clothes , and be careful about the materials you buy .
Wool and cotton fabrics have a really high greenhouse gas impact .
Manmade fibers such as polyester are a better choice .
There &apos;s no point having the heat up high while the wind &apos;s blowing in under the door or sneaking in through the window .
Reseal all window frames to keep the heat in .
Try to buy high-quality , long-lasting products even though they may cost a little more .
A laptop is more efficient than a desktop , and a small screen TV is better than a big flat-screen .
Only turn the water heater on when necessary , and adjust temperature controls to avoid overheating .
Put a lid on a pan when boiling water .
When using the washing machine , be sure there &apos;s a full load and turn the temperature down if it &apos;s not really grubby .
The greediest home device along with the washing machine is the fridge .
Make sure it &apos;s as efficient as possible by keeping it out of direct sunlight and away from the oven or heater .
Don &apos;t put food in when it &apos;s still warm .
This is obvious , but essential : switch off all appliances when you &apos;re not using them . This includes lights .
Conserve energy by using efficient light bulbs .
They use about one-third of the energy of normal bulbs and last 10 times as long .
Only print things out when necessary , and print double-sided and reduce the margins .
Take your own mug and cutlery to work .
This saves throwing away disposable cups and containers--but that could be outweighed by washing your cutlery .
So , pay attention to how you use water when washing your dishes .
Find out what the recycling options are in your area .
Then make sure you keep items such as paper and plastic bottles separate so that they can be recycled .
There are places where you can recycle electronic appliances and batteries . Make sure you find them .
Look for reusable , recyclable , biodegradable items and remember to carry your reusable shopping bags !
Each week , choose one day when you don &apos;t eat meat .
Meat uses up lots of energy because it takes a long time to produce .
Only buy the amount of food you need and if there are leftovers , get creative .
For instance , make them into a soup .
Ask to take food home from restaurants if there &apos;s some left , but remember to take your own container to avoid using a disposable carton .
Food production eats up lots of energy .
When you buy food , go local rather than imported , and get fresh vegetables instead of frozen .
It &apos;s a tall order : Over the next few decades , the world will need to wean itself from dependence on fossil fuels and drastically reduce greenhouse gases .
Current technology will take us only so far ; major breakthroughs are required .
What might those breakthroughs be ?
Here &apos;s a look at five technologies that , if successful , could radically change the world energy picture .
They present enormous opportunities .
The ability to tap power from space , for instance , could jump-start whole new industries .
Technology that can trap and store carbon dioxide from coal-fired plants would rejuvenate older ones .
Success isn &apos;t assured , of course .
The technologies present difficult engineering challenges , and some require big scientific leaps in lab-created materials or genetically modified plants .
And innovations have to be delivered at a cost that doesn &apos;t make energy much more expensive .
If all of that can be done , any one of these technologies could be a game-changer .
SPACE-BASED SOLAR POWER
For more than three decades , visionaries have imagined tapping solar power where the sun always shines -- in space .
If we could place giant solar panels in orbit around the Earth , and beam even a fraction of the available energy back to Earth , they could deliver nonstop electricity to any place on the planet .
The technology may sound like science fiction , but it &apos;s simple : Solar panels in orbit about 22,000 miles up beam energy in the form of microwaves to earth , where it &apos;s turned into electricity and plugged into the grid .
( The low-powered beams are considered safe . )
A ground receiving station a mile in diameter could deliver about 1,000 megawatts -- enough to power on average about one million U.S. homes .
The cost of sending solar collectors into space is the biggest obstacle , so it &apos;s necessary to design a system lightweight enough to require only a few launches .
A handful of countries and companies aim to deliver space-based power as early as a decade from now .
ADVANCED CAR BATTERIES
Electrifying vehicles could slash petroleum use and help clean the air ( if electric power shifts to low-carbon fuels like wind or nuclear ) .
But it &apos;s going to take better batteries .
Lithium-ion batteries , common in laptops , are favored for next-generation plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles .
They &apos;re more powerful than other auto batteries , but they &apos;re expensive and still don &apos;t go far on a charge ; the Chevy Volt , a plug-in hybrid coming next year , can run about 40 miles on batteries alone .
Ideally , electric cars will get closer to 400 miles on a charge .
While improvements are possible , lithium-ion &apos;s potential is limited .
One alternative , lithium-air , promises 10 times the performance of lithium-ion batteries and could deliver about the same amount of energy , pound for pound , as gasoline .
A lithium-air battery pulls oxygen from the air for its charge , so the device can be smaller and more lightweight .
A handful of labs are working on the technology , but scientists think that without a breakthrough they could be a decade away from commercialization .
UTILITY STORAGE
Everybody &apos;s rooting for wind and solar power . How could you not ?
But wind and solar are use-it-or-lose-it resources .
To make any kind of difference , they need better storage .
Scientists are attacking the problem from a host of angles -- all of which are still problematic .
One , for instance , uses power produced when the wind is blowing to compress air in underground chambers ; the air is fed into gas-fired turbines to make them run more efficiently .
One of the obstacles : finding big , usable , underground caverns .
Similarly , giant batteries can absorb wind energy for later use , but some existing technologies are expensive , and others aren &apos;t very efficient .
While researchers are looking at new materials to improve performance , giant technical leaps aren &apos;t likely .
Lithium-ion technology may hold the greatest promise for grid storage , where it doesn &apos;t have as many limitations as for autos .
As performance improves and prices come down , utilities could distribute small , powerful lithium-ion batteries around the edge of the grid , closer to customers .
There , they could store excess power from renewables and help smooth small fluctuations in power , making the grid more efficient and reducing the need for backup fossil-fuel plants .
And utilities can piggy-back on research efforts for vehicle batteries .
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE
Keeping coal as an abundant source of power means slashing the amount of carbon dioxide it produces .
That could mean new , more efficient power plants .
But trapping C02 from existing plants -- about two billion tons a year -- would be the real game-changer .
Techniques for modest-scale CO2 capture exist , but applying them to big power plants would reduce the plants &apos; output by a third and double the cost of producing power .
So scientists are looking into experimental technologies that could cut emissions by 90 % while limiting cost increases .
Nearly all are in the early stages , and it &apos;s too early to tell which method will win out .
One promising technique burns coal and purified oxygen in the form of a metal oxide , rather than air ; this produces an easier-to-capture concentrated stream of CO2 with little loss of plant efficiency .
The technology has been demonstrated in small-scale pilots , and will be tried in a one-megawatt test plant next year .
But it might not be ready for commercial use until 2020 .
NEXT-GENERATION BIOFUELS
One way to wean ourselves from oil is to come up with renewable sources of transportation fuel .
That means a new generation of biofuels made from nonfood crops .
Researchers are devising ways to turn lumber and crop wastes , garbage and inedible perennials like switchgrass into competitively priced fuels .
But the most promising next-generation biofuel comes from algae .
Algae grow fast , consume carbon dioxide and can generate more than 5,000 gallons a year per acre of biofuel , compared with 350 gallons a year for corn-based ethanol .
Algae-based fuel can be added directly into existing refining and distribution systems .
in theory , the U.S. could produce enough of it to meet all of the nation &apos;s transportation needs .
But it &apos;s early .
Dozens of companies have begun pilot projects and small-scale production .
But producing algae biofuels in quantity means finding reliable sources of inexpensive nutrients and water , managing pathogens that could reduce yield , and developing and cultivating the most productive algae strains .
Hungry prehistoric hunters , not climate change , drove elephants and wooly mammoths to extinction during the Pleistocene era , new research suggests .
One slips on so-so earnings – only $ 7bn in quarterly profits . The other jumps 3 per cent on a deal that will hurt its bottom line .
It isn ’ t hard to see that the latter , Lenovo , has more market momentum than Samsung Electronics .
Both make consumer electronics and tech hardware , from Lenovo ’ s new server business to Samsung ’ s chips .
Might Lenovo become the next Samsung ?
On a size basis , the comparison is still a bit ridiculous .
Samsung ’ s market capitalisation is $ 160bn ; Lenovo ’ s , $ 14bn .
Samsung ’ s profits last quarter were 10 times Lenovo ’ s for the past year .
Still , Lenovo ’ s deal this week to buy IBM ’ s X86 server business demonstrates that it still has the ambition it showed when it bought Big Blue ’ s PC business in 2004 .
The relatively low price paid – half of sales – reflects the IBM unit ’ s swing into loss last year .
The business will knock about 5 per cent off Lenovo ’ s full-year earnings per share , including the slight dilution from the shares issued to IBM .
The shares ’ rise suggests that investors think it can use its lower cost structure to lift profits .
Investors like bold tech stories .
Samsung ’ s success was not born of timidity either .
It has never bought in growth as Lenovo has , but has taken risks to move up the value chain .
One of the reasons for its unexpectedly poor earnings in the latest quarter was a Won800bn ( $ 738m ) bonus paid to employees to mark the 20th anniversary of a strategy .
Back then its chairman made a bonfire of 150,000 mobile phones – worth $ 50m – to make the point he wanted better .
Now Samsung is trying to push into software – a challenge for a company staffed by hardware engineers .
Samsung ’ s shares have risen 20 per cent a year , compounded , for the past two decades .
Should Lenovo follow suit , it will take it a little over a decade to reach Samsung ’ s present size .
Lenovo has momentum on its side .
But can it sustain profit growth on a foundation of low-cost manufacture of commodity hardware ?
Samsung invested aggressively to acquire an enduring competitive advantage – scale – in chips , and from there built a hugely profitable premium phone business .
Lenovo needs to find a similar edge .
Combining sales growth with cost cutting is not an innovative idea .
It represents , nonetheless , a shocking return to sanity in Chinese retailing .
The 9 per cent opening pop in Gome ’ s shares after it raised its profits shows the importance of the simple improvements the company has made .
Last year Gome was lossmaking .
It became caught in a vicious online battle for market share in China ’ s electrical appliances market , the largest ecommerce sector after clothes .
Rivals such as 360 Buy , a purely online operator , had pledged zero gross margins for three years and other disrupting tactics .
Slowing sales that followed the expiry of some government subsidies hurt , too .
Yet this week Gome talked of same-store sales growing by 15 per cent ( above overall retail sales ) and an 18 per cent gross margin – half as much again as the level of three years ago .
Granted , that still lags behind the likes of Best Buy in the US , Japan ’ s Yamada Denki ( 23 per cent ) and Europe ’ s Darty group ( 32 per cent ) , but the size of the improvement delivered by a tactic as basic as cost-cutting is impressive .
More gains are possible . Consider inventory turnover , where Gome managed to cut its cycle by 14 days to 56 in the first half of 2013 .
It said then it thought there were another eight days it could trim over the next two years .
The company has focused on better positioning its store network and it is working : the rising sales have come on the back of less bricks-and-mortar space .
The real expansion in Chinese retail will be online , where sales could rise a quarter each year to 2018 , Citi estimates .
Gome still has to figure out how to make money from its online operations .
But in the meantime , do not ignore its achievement in swapping a disastrous online market share battle for a steady approach to bricks and mortar .
Xi Guohua will not have to join any queues to get his iPhone .
The China Mobile chairman was given one by Apple chief Tim Cook .
Friday sees the launch of the iPhone on the Chinese network , with its mind-boggling 750m subscriber base .
But the iPhone ’ s moment in the world ’ s biggest market comes just as the local competition is gearing up .
If , as Apple ’ s ( and Samsung ’ s ) margins suggest , even high-end smartphones are becoming less profitable , what are the likes of Huawei , Lenovo and Xiaomi thinking ?
Combined , China ’ s top 10 makers expect to shift more than 400m phones this year , a 50 per cent increase on 2013 .
About 440m smartphones will be sold in China in 2014 , according to Credit Suisse – a 25 per cent jump .
That includes Apple , Samsung and other top-tier makers , implying the home brands must also be aiming for other emerging markets , where sales are expected to rise a third , to 470m Chinese makers often have high-end ambitions , but their bread and butter is in the low- and mid-range phones that rule emerging markets .
Plentiful demand is one thing , making money is another .
Apple and Samsung profit from using their scale and brands to cut costs and demand top dollar .
Low-end phones cost far less to make .
The cost of producing a so-so brand 4.7 ’ ’ screen phone could be as low as $ 94 , Credit Suisse reckons , compared with $ 266 for Samsung ’ s Galaxy S4 .
But that cheap phone sells for $ 122 , versus $ 554 for Samsung ’ s smash hit .
That is a 10 times difference in gross profit .
Sure , commoditisation will squeeze Samsung and Apple , but it will not entirely kill their pricing power .
If consumers happily pay premiums for cigarettes and branded water , it is not hard to see value in a strong phone brand .
Chinese makers could try taking on Samsung and Apple by building rival brands – but ask HTC about the risks in that .
The jump in this year ’ s shipments implies they are instead seeking scale in order to squeeze suppliers and grind out profits .
It is the better plan , but it will not make much money , either .
‘ Tron ’ is a cool , if slightly scary , name for a video-game console .
It is also a 1982 Disney film about being trapped in a virtual world .
This has not stopped Huawei from launching a gaming device by that name in China , its home market , in 2014 .
Telecoms equipment is , however , a much larger business for this ambitious , unlisted , employee-owned company , founded by an ex-military engineer . Investors in the sector ’ s other big players are , increasingly , trapped in Huawei ’ s world .
Cheap consoles will help build Huawei ’ s brand now that it is shaking up consumer electronics in emerging markets , led by increasing sales of cheap smartphones .
Revealing its 2013 results on Tuesday , the company said it planned to shift 80m units this year – 30m more than last year .
Selling kit to carrier networks still accounted for three-quarters or so of its $ 40bn in revenues last year , growing decently from 2012 levels .
That should spook investors in Cisco , Alcatel-Lucent or Ericsson – for two reasons .
First , whatever it was that battered Cisco ’ s business in several emerging markets towards the end of 2013 , it did no harm to Huawei .
Potential Cisco customers might be put off by the revelations about US spies snooping via private hardware and be less worried than western politicians about China peeking down Huawei ’ s wires .
But it is more likely that Huawei is simply beating the western companies in emerging markets , just as big opportunities there ( the transition to 4G ) come up for grabs .
Huawei ’ s target for dollar revenue growth is 10 per cent per year to 2017 .
Ericsson sees the equipment market growing at 3 per cent to 5 per cent .
This suggests Huawei will take more share .
But Huawei does not detail which divisions will provide the growth . Nor does it say much about where its capital has , or will , come from .
Information about employees ’ share ownership or future bond issues ( it sold $ 150m in debt in Hong Kong three years ago ) is scant .
It is hard to know , therefore , whether Huawei ’ s expansion is sustainable or not .
In the race to build in-car information systems , Google may be destined for the checkered flag for one simple reason : It has the killer map .
At the International CES show last week , Google and several car makers , including General Motors , launched the Open Automotive Alliance .
This is a plan to establish Google &apos;s Android operating system as a common platform for apps in the connected car .
That opens a new front in Google &apos;s battle with Apple , which announced plans last year to integrate its devices into car makers &apos; dashboard control panels , and Microsoft , which developed in-car voice-activated and touch-screen technologies with Ford Motor .
Given rivals &apos; earlier moves , Google could be seen as having a late start .
But the open nature of Android has obvious appeal .
The ability for a company to customize Android persuades even Google &apos;s rivals to use it ; Amazon.com , for example , tweaked the software for its own Kindle reading device .
Given vehicle development &apos;s long lead times , these are important considerations .
More important may be Google &apos;s map expertise .
Having sent cars with cameras all over the world to develop its Street View capabilities , the company has created maps that are extremely accurate and up to date where others aren &apos;t .
Think of the apology Apple had to issue in 2012 following criticism of a new version of its own Maps app , which was designed to replace Google &apos;s .
The popularity of Google &apos;s maps for devices running Android and Apple &apos;s iOS creates a network effect .
The more people who use Google Maps , the more information Google has on factors such as traffic , and the more appealing the product becomes .
Such was the logic behind Google &apos;s purchase of Waze , a real-time traffic-information app , last year .
And don &apos;t forget a big reason for Google &apos;s interest in cartography is its autonomous vehicle program .
A crash means something quite different for a car compared with a smartphone .
To minimize the potential for error , a must from both a regulatory and product-liability standpoint , a self-driving car needs a painstakingly accurate map .
With a gaggle of companies demonstrating autonomous and semiautonomous vehicle technology at CES , and likely at this week &apos;s auto show in Detroit , the day when commercially available self-driving cars cruise U.S. roads looks less a futurist daydream and more a rapidly approaching reality .
&apos;With U.S. drivers driving 75 billion hours a year , autonomous cars are also poised to have a much greater impact on society as a whole than most people give them credit for , &apos; Morgan Stanley said in a recent report .
Google &apos;s autonomous-car program is a big reason the concept is being taken so seriously within the automotive industry .
It isn &apos;t hard to envision the company licensing the technology for car makers just as right now it provides its Android operating system to smartphone manufacturers .
At the least , car companies may want to tap Google &apos;s map technology for their programs .
But Google &apos;s wider product offering means they may see it as being in their best interest to build a closer relationship with it over the long term .
All of which gives Google an advantage over the likes of Apple as the autonomous age arrives and Detroit and drivers venture into unfamiliar territory without a map .
A new legal tool for U.S. investors who are locked in disputes with Chinese companies is being put to wider use .
A Delaware Chancery Court judge on Jan. 6 awarded investors who had tried unsuccessfully to gain access to the books of China &apos;s Yinlips Technology Inc. the ability to sell their shares back to the company .
It also appointed a receiver to seize the company &apos;s assets to fulfill the transaction .
Yinlips , an electronics company , didn &apos;t respond to a request for comment .
The ruling builds on a similar case last year , when another judge in Delaware Chancery Court granted essentially the same remedy to investors of a different Chinese company .
Together , the two cases are providing investors with a way to strike back at Chinese companies that cost investors money when their stocks drop because of alleged accounting or disclosure problems .
David Graff , a lawyer at the New York law firm of Anderson Kill who represents the investors in both cases , said he was aware of at least six other pending court cases against Chinese companies in which such a remedy could come into play .
Yinlips entered the U.S. in 2008 via a private placement of stock to investors , and Mr. Graff alleged in an interview that it &apos; absconded with the investor funds.&apos;
Yinlips said in U.S. government filings that it planned to trade on U.S. markets .
But the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the U.S. registration of the company &apos;s securities last July after Yinlips failed to file required annual and quarterly reports .
Four investors who bought a total of 1.5 million Yinlips shares in the private placement sued to force the company to open its books to them .
Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Donald F. Parsons Jr. ruled in their favor last October .
Mr. Graff said in a court hearing last week that Yinlips ignored the ruling and that at one point the company &apos; forcibly removed &apos; the investors &apos; representatives from its offices when they informed it of the litigation .
The judge found Yinlips in contempt , calling its conduct egregious and saying it had &apos; acted in bad faith.&apos;
He awarded the investors a put option to force Yinlips to buy back their shares at fair-market value , which will be determined at a court hearing to be held in late February or early March .
Mr. Parsons also appointed a receiver to help satisfy the judgment , with the authority &apos; to seize , deal in or dispose of any property of the company &apos; in the U.S. , China or elsewhere , according to the ruling .
In his ruling , Mr. Parsons cited the earlier case , in which a different judge ruled last March that investor Peter Deutsch was entitled to force network-equipment maker ZST Digital Networks Inc. to buy back his ZST shares for above-market prices totaling more than $ 32 million and to have the receiver seize and sell ZST assets to satisfy the judgment .
ZST didn &apos;t respond to a request for comment .
It can be challenging to go after a Chinese company &apos;s assets held outside the U.S. , but the receiver has said he has seized ZST bank accounts and control over some of its subsidiaries , and in August ZST indicated it was open to discussing a settlement of Mr. Deutsch &apos;s claims .
Mr. Graff declined to comment on the status of any ZST settlement discussions .
