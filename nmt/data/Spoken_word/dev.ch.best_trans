You would feel that there was no _UNK_ in the night .
You go to bed , you go to bed , and you lie down ,
It &apos;s not just going to fall asleep , but entered the _UNK_ .
This is time for a period of time , a period of time .
So how do we hope to _UNK_ -- if all night is interrupted ,
Why do we want you to work well ?
And if they were always disturbed , if they were always disturbed ,
And we asked them to work well ?
And it was a very _UNK_ for me .
So why do you work in other places ,
or you &apos;re _UNK_ on your couch and what you want .
They would ask you not to work at home ,
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t even see them , how do I know they work ? &quot;
It &apos;s ridiculous , but a lot of _UNK_ will always take it for an excuse .
But we &apos;re going to be able to improve the situation
but it &apos;s not going to really interfere with you .
You can decide when you &apos;re going to watch TV ;
when you decide to open the _UNK_ ;
when you decide to go downstairs and take a walk .
And in the office , most of the _UNK_
and the interference of the elements that are _UNK_ .
and often think that when work really makes you _UNK_ ,
There are some _UNK_ that can &apos;t even open these sites .
Is this in China ? How is this going to be ?
And that &apos;s why you can &apos;t do it in time ,
Over 10 years ago , people went out to work for 15 minutes and didn &apos;t care .
will there be a lot of opinions about it ?
And the problem is that I call it
These are the things that are in the office today ,
and the reason that the employees don &apos;t work well ,
When you hear people talking about their respective efficiency places ,
like in the house , in cars and planes ,
or at night or morning talking about it ,
You will find a lot of other interference factors , but not _UNK_ to managers and meetings .
The manager and the meeting will only be the disturbance of office office ,
It &apos;s also the manager who likes to do the work .
The act of their _UNK_ is actually a disturbance .
There are a lot of managers in the world ,
and there &apos;s a lot of people who have a lot of employees .
There is a lot of interference due to the manager .
And in order to investigate the progress , they would ask , &quot; What &apos;s going to work ?
to show me that . &quot; And so on .
They &apos;re always going to _UNK_ you in the _UNK_ time ,
When you &apos;re trying to finish their mission ,
But there &apos;s a little worse than that ,
And you don &apos;t see the meeting of the staff ;
This is really a very _UNK_ thing .
We &apos;re going to call 10 people a meeting now .
What you &apos;re going to do is stop everything in hand and come in . &quot;
And that 10 people stopped to the meeting all of a sudden ?
And then suddenly , you tell them , you have to stop _UNK_
They went into the conference room , and they got together ,
and talk about something that doesn &apos;t matter at all .
The meeting was intended to discuss the plan after the company .
and the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
The boss always wants to open a meeting for an hour ,
But this is not true , unless there is only one in the conference room .
If there were ten people at the meeting , it was ten hours of meeting , not an hour .
This 10 hours of meeting _UNK_ other organizations or other people ,
This conference should be _UNK_ by two or three _UNK_ .
_UNK_ 15 minutes , _UNK_ or one hour .
You can &apos;t . Of course , I don &apos;t know you can &apos;t .
You can extend 15 minutes , 45 minutes , or one hour .
And when it was an emergency , you know ,
So meetings and managers are the major problems in business today ,
They can _UNK_ the office to work for employees ,
It makes the office the preferred part of the work .
&quot; When I really want to work , I &apos;ll go to the office . &quot;
all the things that are involved in the work ,
But now you don &apos;t want to go to the office , how should we change this situation ?
I have three proposals , and now I &apos;m going to share with you .
It takes about three minutes to explain it .
It was easier to take a half the day , Thursday afternoon good .
Imagine the first afternoon in the morning of Thursday ,
There is no talk about in the office .
There was no one who was talking about ,
is that there is no interference in the world .
and four hours of working for the time ,
is the best gift to those who need work .
than _UNK_ _UNK_ , software is going to work hard ,
to give them four hours of quiet office --
If you try to do it , you will agree to it .
Maybe you can take a couple of times .
You will find that it &apos;s a very effective thing .
_UNK_ their shoulders , saying you &apos;re good , including the active communication ,
is going to be more passive in terms of communication .
Some people may say that email is very interference ,
But these _UNK_ factors are not in your own choice .
You can &apos;t use email functions , but you can &apos;t respond to your boss &apos;s email .
When you are free , you will have a personal time ;
Or when you &apos;re going to leave , your journey will be _UNK_ .
You &apos;re going to do something else first , slowly _UNK_ ,
and then you can do the work for the next year ,
Now , sometimes you have to check email , look at the _UNK_ .
There are few things that are going to happen
At the same time , you need to solve the problem immediately .
to encourage you to use multiple tools like _UNK_ and email ,
And there are other things that are _UNK_ ,
and then let you go on with them .
If you &apos;re going to open a meeting ,
This is Friday , generally speaking , the conference will be on Monday .
but forget the meeting , the meeting is in place .
you will find that everything is going to work well .
All of these things you have to do Monday morning .
and I was going to talk to you about
and forget them , it &apos;s going to be all right .
So , everyone thought they would have a more open morning ,
And you can see , maybe these things you have to do
And this is the three advice that I have ,
And the _UNK_ are still in the administration ,
It &apos;s better than to give you more time to work on the matter .
So , I think the last thing is going to get .
and use the knowledge we &apos;ve learned to look at the future .
_UNK_ , I &apos;ve done this for seven years ,
I don &apos;t know how the future will be .
Most of them are in India , China , Brazil and Africa
We live on this planet -- _UNK_ humans .
About three billion people , at the end of this year ,
There will be another billion people in the next two years .
We need to understand how they think about it .
And this is the focus of my work .
Our research generally begins by a simple problem ,
For example , what do you take with today ?
you will think of all the things you have
What are you going to do with you ?
Think about the last thing you &apos;re carrying with every day
then there is a certain value in the spirit of love and function .
We are willing to buy something that &apos;s worth it ?
I would have _UNK_ people &apos;s pockets and their wallet
I could even visit their home all over the world .
and then took the camera and they went to the town ,
We &apos;re just trying to find the answer to the problem .
We found that we had a lot of things
But what three things you have to take every day
through culture , sex , and context --
I &apos;m not saying that this is a good thing , but it &apos;s a thing ?
I can &apos;t get your cell phone out of your hand .
I don &apos;t have to say that I &apos;m a phone brand .
Why are these things important to us ?
Our research indicates that these items can save your life .
to save ourselves and the rest of us
We need a key to opening our own door
The cell phone is actually a tool for restoration .
If you &apos;re interested in the theory of needs ,
And of course , they have a lot of other functions .
And I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
You can go beyond the phone by calling .
Or you can _UNK_ a short message on your personal condition .
_UNK_ can also be able to look at them
and the public is always interested in this communication .
And that &apos;s why the world has three billion people
In fact , the computer can do that .
But the good thing about cell phones is that it &apos;s very _UNK_ .
to give you enough privacy and it &apos;s very convenient .
you &apos;re going to go directly to the phone ?
although it &apos;s important , but sometimes we forget
We are people , and we forget things , as we are ,
to be able to adapt to all kinds of situations
When you &apos;re going to go out and out ,
you can turn around and feel your pocket ,
even those women who put things on the purse are doing the same thing .
you turn around and look at the room
that every time you go back and forth ,
In addition , most people have a relatively stable life .
I mean , they don &apos;t have to run around the world or always stay in hotels .
Everybody has a place where we call the key position .
This is the focus of the things that you &apos;ve got to do
and they &apos;re probably not going to be there .
Well , it &apos;s easy to remember what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s not funny that it &apos;s not a big cake in China ?
But this is the art of _UNK_ work .
of a kind of understanding of the technology
If you want you to _UNK_ your mission to other people ,
In addition to the physical response , like to the toilet ,
and people can &apos;t do it for you .
You &apos;re not going to call someone to the cinema .
Now let me give you an example of a real distributed task .
And this is probably the most passionate thing I &apos;ve ever done .
a study of the _UNK_ that we have
The statistics of _UNK_ in 2004 showed that
There &apos;s about _UNK_ in the world . It &apos;s not going to be written .
And what we &apos;re looking at is that
You have to have the ability to recognize
can be a telephone number , or an email address ,
It turns out that a lot of people can deal with
From the design point , we can &apos;t understand how they do it .
How do we do what we do with our research
In fact , they are the _UNK_ of mission .
They called some of the parts of a task
This is a survey that we did in Uganda .
about people sharing and share a device
_UNK_ is a _UNK_ in Uganda , which means money .
And it &apos;s also an idea that when it &apos;s going to go ,
than if you &apos;re in a remote village in June ,
I &apos;m going to go back and go back
And in your village he has a cell phone
There should be a standard cell phone in common calls .
So I &apos;m going to buy a _UNK_ card
I &apos;m not going to put my money in my own phone .
and tell him the code on the _UNK_ , and he _UNK_ his cell
The amount of your village is on a phone account .
You take the commission of the commission of the _UNK_ .
A commission for a number of phone calls for _UNK_ .
and I &apos;ll give you a lot more money in cash .
First of all , anyone who can contact the phone
And even if they can get access to the bank ,
because they don &apos;t have a bank account ,
that I &apos;ve been studying for years and years .
I can &apos;t design the same elegant thing .
and the actual condition of the local situation is completely _UNK_ .
Yes , we have a bank and a small amount of money
This system is the _UNK_ of the authority institution .
So the streets are always the same thing
If you &apos;ve done that , you &apos;ll return to _UNK_
Is it not going to buy a _UNK_ ?
If you go to India or China , you see business like this .
and they _UNK_ the damage of the damage .
and then _UNK_ the sale of the _UNK_ .
In the _UNK_ of China , one of the _UNK_
And you can see them _UNK_ a cell
They also set up a special training institution , a _UNK_ ,
At the end of this business , a very small store in _UNK_
A _UNK_ , a _UNK_ , used to clean up the phone parts .
because the receiver is always more and more places
It &apos;s about how to spread this knowledge , it &apos;s spread throughout the community .
And the reason I love this is because it &apos;s a challenge for our product design .
And for me , the streets are going to be _UNK_ .
For example , I bought this bottle of _UNK_ in China .
In China , you can buy a lot of _UNK_ .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , don &apos;t you have a trial
I look at it from another perspective , and I think this is about
How do we apply it to life ?
For example , it &apos;s an idea -- we learned from it .
How do you _UNK_ online services and new services
And I looked at it , and I said ,
Why would someone make a pocket on the _UNK_ ?
And this is what I want to do
If we think about all the functions of this thing ,
Yes , it looks a little bit complicated , but it &apos;s going to be connected .
What you see is a number of phone numbers
These are not the _UNK_ , but the telephone number
Who is the man who is using cell phones ?
Is it true that people actually use cell phone numbers ?
And I &apos;ll show you some pictures , the first picture I took
You can see that he &apos;s _UNK_ a good tea
He was a partner in this extremely poor tea .
to me that personality can lead to the world .
and every thing is _UNK_ together , the individual
The title of this talk is to the conclusion
This is the summary of my five years of research .
about every single person on this planet --
The first is the idea of the _UNK_
But the big idea is that it &apos;s changing
If you want a big idea , you have to accept every person on this planet
when these things are going to be _UNK_ ,
and they &apos;re getting more and more powerful .
These elements are naturally spread around the world .
So the speed of the thing is that
and it &apos;s going to be the same thing .
that we can &apos;t use language to express
whether we &apos;re going to try to design this thing ,
and it &apos;s going to be able to make new innovation .
For example , it has the ability to travel through time and space
They will do the different kinds of innovation that we don &apos;t expect .
They can even do better than we do .
If we are intelligent , we will focus on the trends of these things .
we &apos;ll find a way to make it go forward .
And the last point is that this is the focus
The most important thing is to take and learn how to listen .
One way to change gene is to create new genes ,
In fact , we found that the latter had a great effect
that we don &apos;t have to wait for these measures .
When you eat more health , you know how to deal with release pressure , adhere to exercise and love ,
your brain will get more _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
Not only that , your brain will grow up in volume .
A few years ago we thought that this growth was impossible to measure ,
I prefer chocolate , tea and tea , and _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , cocaine , alcohol abuse and long - term pressure .
When you improve your habits , the skin will be more _UNK_ ,
It can slow aging because the skin is not so easy to _UNK_ .
Our research points out that this can even stop heart attack .
And you can see that the upper left is _UNK_ ,
And we look at the _UNK_ of this heart ,
In the same year , we see orange and white , they &apos;re saying the biggest _UNK_ .
Our research also shows that ( through healthy ) strategy can prevent even _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , early prostate cancer , including breast cancer .
And we found that in vitro , in vitro ,
The tumor growth in the _UNK_ has been _UNK_ ,
in all the _UNK_ advertising , the most effective one --
And we &apos;re going to publish a survey recently ,
It shows that men in _UNK_ have the ability to change their genes .
It uses different colors to represent different properties . The right graph shows the genes .
We found that _UNK_ had a benign mutation ,
We can activate the genes that are good and able to prevent disease ,
I think that these discoveries will be very influential ,
the companies that provide personal _UNK_ for customers ,
and often give customers &quot; Oh , what do I do ? &quot;
But in fact , our genes are not the end . If we make positive changes ,
So even though we have the tendency to have a disease ,
We can still change the expression of our genes .
I want to talk about the _UNK_ of today ,
And as the _UNK_ of the moving equipment ,
is a responsibility or obligation to the cultural _UNK_ .
He said , &quot; No truth data support is lies . &quot;
is about how we solve this problem in the public .
whether you play a role in the conference ,
And you sit there , looking at other people , waiting for them to turn around ,
Even if you see somebody on the right , he &apos;s angry .
And the man said to him , &quot; Go to you ,
It &apos;s better to say , &quot; Let me find my _UNK_ . &quot;
We can also call &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; stop me before I die ! &quot;
And what we found is that this is
and the human needs , which we &apos;ve heard a lot of times ,
But this is a story that allows us to develop culture .
I &apos;m just as important as my cell phone . &quot;
is more interesting than it is today .
But this was recorded and the kissed was not sweet .
And as we lose the background of our identity ,
to become the main part of our lives ,
And these stories tell us what we share
This is what I ask for you to do .
These technologies will create a new share experience ,
This is always going to happen in Hollywood --
and he couldn &apos;t do some of the _UNK_
It &apos;s about 25 years old , and I started to figure out
and then it was 30 years old to regret
is a door that I got out of the _UNK_ store --
And I was in the broad daylight ,
The corner of the _UNK_ of Broadway and _UNK_
It &apos;s a good place to collapse because people are _UNK_ you .
I went back home the night and the emotion _UNK_ .
And it was a really amazing shock to me
but I think it &apos;s going to be
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m now going to be .
And that means that I know that our culture
is to be sad for the past .
We should always go forward and not just look forward .
And what we &apos;d better do is to do
in order to live in the world without regret .
First of all , this is a philosophy of life --
If I don &apos;t tell you who you say ,
and tell her husband not to be like a _UNK_ .
And this is a story of Shakespeare , in fact ,
And it &apos;s also a kind of brain injury .
It &apos;s a very wrong decision that never fails to regret .
So if you think about it , you know ,
then you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
the emotional expression of the emotions in the world
First of all -- we &apos;ve made a decision
We want to imagine if we can go back and make different choices .
So we can imagine the future of the future .
What &apos;s going to happen at the moment is that
And the more we have -- the more we have --
You &apos;re on the way to your friend &apos;s wedding .
and the way the airport is going to be
If you &apos;re just late for three minutes ,
because if you &apos;re just late for three minutes ,
&quot; I should not walk into the bridge .
We feel that we are responsible for a decision
And we &apos;re obviously _UNK_ a lot of things
But at last , there was a researcher who thought
So let &apos;s look at the results of this
and it &apos;s better to use the education resources
or to learn a different kind of professional
all kinds of definitions of our own decisions
In other words , we &apos;ve been studying _UNK_
But it turns out that when you think about people &apos;s lives ,
Our financial decision was that it was not the _UNK_ .
The regret of the financial sector is to be _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
because you don &apos;t care about it in five years .
And for the fact that we really care about
And when I looked at my house , I went home ,
It &apos;s like , &quot; I want my mom ! &quot;
don &apos;t try to understand the root of the problem .
And what I thought in the bedroom was that night
that part of itself is isolated to himself .
And we don &apos;t like that part of ourselves --
In short , _UNK_ said , &quot; Do want to take a hand ! &quot;
and it &apos;s going to be repeated over and over again .
And I sat in the bedroom the night .
These are the four stages of the _UNK_ .
But I want to talk about the fifth stage
and then you take them back and forth ,
_UNK_ insurance is not _UNK_ for natural disaster .
So my medical insurance doesn &apos;t include my own _UNK_ .
There is no insurance for the _UNK_ themselves .
And I think this is for the Chinese .
And this is the kind of _UNK_ culture
And we thought that we were going to have
But the problem is that there &apos;s a lot of life
And for those who are _UNK_ and _UNK_ --
because we wanted to do something that was absolutely good .
to control the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And I &apos;m going to talk about it a moment .
and the strength and the duration of the time
depends on the _UNK_ of the particular object
You may not be careful about this button .
Or it was in the office trying to drill a tunnel
or they were _UNK_ out of the fire ,
And the worst thing is that the life of others
to be able to _UNK_ us for a few days .
So how can we face the _UNK_ ?
to allow us to _UNK_ the ground
And the second thing is to be _UNK_
It &apos;s not hard for me to do it .
because if you were 29 years old , because
a new _UNK_ , a mom , a _UNK_ ,
And although some people think that the suggestion is really _UNK_
because it &apos;s able to connect us to the extreme
to give us a little bit of current
And the third thing I think is that through time ,
Do you want to look at it ?
And basically it &apos;s kind of like the same thing .
is that I don &apos;t like the pattern ,
I know some of you will think about it .
It &apos;s not the worst thing you think of .
And when I went to New York City ,
And during that time I realized something important
the goal that you have in your mind
I like the little _UNK_ that I did .
is because the pattern is going to be the _UNK_
I think this will become my permanent memory .
just to think of what I &apos;d like to do .
And the lesson of the _UNK_ is that
and one of the most important lessons in life
And _UNK_ , I think the only _UNK_ _UNK_
I can put it on the _UNK_ --
don &apos;t want to hurt them or lose them .
but don &apos;t want to _UNK_ yourself for regret .
And what I learned from the _UNK_ ,
I want to share with you today .
but to remind us that we can do better .
And before I came to my TED wish ,
And I &apos;d like to explain my pursuit ,
And what I &apos;m looking for is the pursuit of these people .
As you know , we live in a world that is bound to depend on each other ,
half of the world &apos;s life costs less than two dollars ,
a billion people can &apos;t get clean water ,
There are no basic health systems in _UNK_ ,
There is a case of AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria ,
and other _UNK_ diseases that are created --
These are the five - year - old children .
Even in the rich country , the rise of rich and poor gap is becoming obvious .
In the United States , we &apos;ve experienced five years of economic growth ,
But the wages were _UNK_ , and the lower families of poverty
and the ratio goes up to the _UNK_ .
The percentage of non - medical insurance is rising to _UNK_ .
Now the world that _UNK_ each other is good for most of us ,
And that &apos;s why we can live in California tonight ,
But in fact , it &apos;s not equal to it .
The disease diffusion within the global scale of weapon ,
and a kind of _UNK_ that we &apos;ve never seen before .
But the most important thing is that the world is not sustainable --
Environmental change , resources and extinction of the species .
And every time I think of my children ,
What I thought was a _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_
to the _UNK_ , the world of the world ,
and responsibility for the common and _UNK_ of humanity ,
And when Britain suffered a terrorist attack a few years ago ,
I realized that although they lost life in the United States ,
But what really makes the British worry about
The _UNK_ were not a _UNK_ , but native citizens .
For these people , their religious beliefs and political ideas
than people who grew up with them , dinner together , together for weekends ,
This is the most _UNK_ _UNK_ we face in the 21st century .
In this case , we &apos;re not going to work for _UNK_ .
in the history of the last century ,
to be able to vote or remove their government .
Even those non - democratic governments are starting to focus on people .
And the _UNK_ people can get together as long as they are .
to raise a lot of money to change the world , to be good .
When the big tsunami _UNK_ Asia , America _UNK_ $ _UNK_ .
The third reason is because of the rise of the organization .
to change the lives of the people .
There was no one in India . At least there was _UNK_ .
There was no one in China . Now there was a _UNK_ in the government ,
If we don &apos;t have a government registered institution , this number may double .
When I started my foundation , I thought that our world
and I want to leave the world of the next generation ,
I tried to do the best , to pursue really _UNK_ in my life .
to _UNK_ poverty , to prevent climate change ,
_UNK_ the _UNK_ of religion , race and other _UNK_ of the world .
And the way to do that is to get all of our skills
to the people we &apos;ve been using in our team
to change some of the ways of doing this ,
to try to _UNK_ every corner of the world .
One of these examples is what we do for AIDS .
And here I want to talk about the leaders of our AIDS team
And the vision that I &apos;m going to talk about tonight
in the scene . I &apos;m going to thank him for what he did .
When I left , I was invited to the Caribbean
to help solve the _UNK_ of the local HIV crisis .
The price of non - brand drugs at that time is about 500 dollars a year .
It &apos;s not going to cost 400 dollars .
The first country we went to , the _UNK_ Islands ,
The patient had to go through two layers of agents
And suddenly , they can use the same resources
And then we started working with the _UNK_ manufacturers ,
We _UNK_ with them , hoping to develop a new business strategy .
High profits , low sales , add to the _UNK_ payment .
So we raised the production of their marketing and supply ,
to build a turnover , and the payment is stable .
What &apos;s going to do is to say that the drug _UNK_ abandon the operating model ,
and _UNK_ the business in the grocery store .
But the price of the drug is _UNK_ to 140 dollars ,
In _UNK_ , the average price is stable at _UNK_ dollars .
Now we need about 100 dollars to get these drugs .
because no one can afford it to be .
The French also _UNK_ their taxes on the _UNK_ ,
The price of the child is 60 dollars a year .
And we save life and deliver drugs to those who need to be
only one of the last _UNK_ that we have ,
That &apos;s the _UNK_ . We don &apos;t have a _UNK_ , therapy ,
We worked with the American heart Association , a reduction in children &apos;s obesity .
We also try to convey the same ideas to drink , _UNK_ ,
by _UNK_ it , to reduce the school food .
the amount of calories and other things that are not healthy .
And I realized that in the world today ,
We need some people to try to open the public product market .
And this is what we &apos;re going to do right now .
by working with all the organizations in the city to prevent climate change ,
to deal with this , to urge these things
the largest city of greenhouse gases in the world
And why do people use this as a kind of economic burden
I think the reduction of greenhouse gases will generate great interests .
But I _UNK_ him for a while to film another film .
If you look at the truth , you should know
The most important slide in the whole talk about Al Gore is the last ,
and the greenhouse gases should go to a decline .
to change the way that greenhouse gas emissions .
And all of you have to remember it ,
to build the _UNK_ of the world .
And the other thing that we &apos;re doing is related to my wish .
based on the experience of working in the developing world ,
Despite the headline , at least the _UNK_ newspaper headline ,
We can &apos;t do that , not do that because of corruption ,
But I felt that in poor countries , more serious problems than corruption ,
We have enough resources to get these drugs
that we can &apos;t get to people in the world today .
Now , these low - cost drugs can buy in 62 countries ,
It &apos;s about five million people , so it &apos;s going to be profitable .
But there is no appropriate system to deliver them to them .
First of Rwanda , then in _UNK_ and other areas ,
but I &apos;m going to talk about Rwanda tonight --
We &apos;re trying to develop a rural medical model in poverty ,
to solve HIV , tuberculosis , malaria , other infectious diseases ,
_UNK_ and health and other developing countries are poor .
is trying to deal with the medical problems .
We hope this model can be used first to Rwanda ,
And then you can go back and forth
every country in the world is poor .
And the test of the _UNK_ is : first , can this model perform its duties ?
Second , can this be done under a low entropy ?
to help poor nations from international aid in five to 10 years ,
And the more belief is that we have to --
It &apos;s enough to destroy you to sit here tonight .
and the challenges that you have in your life ,
and you pay the difference between your harvest ,
in the area of poverty to build health care .
The most successful people are Paul _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Many of you might have heard him . In the last 20 years ,
He and his team _UNK_ _UNK_ , mainly in _UNK_ .
And even though _UNK_ was _UNK_ -- and the _UNK_ clinic
to be far bigger than their medical teams --
In spite of this , one of them died of tuberculosis without tuberculosis .
In addition , they also have a lot of other amazing medical achievements .
is going to increase the income of this country and fight to HIV ,
because the medical system in Rwanda was completely destroyed in 1994 ,
The income is still a dollar a day .
So I called Paul _UNK_ to ask if he could help me .
Because at the time , if we could confirm this system ,
_UNK_ can do it in _UNK_ , in the country of Rwanda ,
So we can , for this country , for the last 15 years ,
to do a good job in the world ,
Second , we will have a set of applications
Any system of the poorest countries in the world .
Now the work is focused on _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
one of the poorest parts of Rwanda ,
The population is about _UNK_ percent of the population .
We basically apply Paul _UNK_ to the model of _UNK_ .
to ensure that AIDS and tuberculosis can be diagnosed in time .
And they took the medical education , clean water and sanitation ,
for nutrition and help people who have serious problems
to find more professional treatment for the world .
This process , as I mentioned before , has been Paul and his team
through the past 20 years of work in the country ,
and it &apos;s going to be better and better .
In recent years , we &apos;ve just done our work in Rwanda for 18 months .
And the result is so satisfactory that the government in Rwanda
has agreed to implement this system in the country ,
and will provide all the resources in the government to provide necessary support .
To give you a better understanding of our work , I &apos;m going to give you more detailed introduction to our team .
to work for us . Some of them are completely free ,
In addition , we also work for other projects .
is to be done under the leadership of _UNK_ .
But for those who do this job , she looks so extraordinary .
She was the youngest partner in London as she was 20 years old ,
But when she was 45 , she decided to do something different .
Now she worked for our full - time job , and she took little salaries .
She and her business partner for us to create a business plan ,
to help us develop the whole medical system to the country .
And what she did , if she put it in the beginning ,
She could make a large sum of money for her .
When we &apos;ve just come to this region , five years old children have _UNK_
The _UNK_ died before five years ago in the morning .
more than 15 percent of adult and child death
_UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ causes _UNK_ and diarrhea --
The death of the _UNK_ is caused by respiratory disease --
In this region , there is no cure for AIDS or tuberculosis patients .
And in the first 18 months we started , the following thing happened :
The number of AIDS is rising from 0 to 2000 ,
for 80 percent of the population in this area .
not only do that , less than _UNK_ ,
because it stopped taking drugs or other _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s even less than the U.S. data --
You need to be able to buy more expensive drugs .
and _UNK_ the first time in a _UNK_ medical system .
About 40 percent -- I said that the pregnant woman should be _UNK_ --
About 40 percent of tuberculosis patients are receiving treatment ,
And before 18 months ago , this number was 0 .
_UNK_ needs babies to prevent _UNK_ and _UNK_ children .
to help them live and grow and grow .
We also helped them build their first cure for malaria .
_UNK_ was sent to our _UNK_ hospital in the _UNK_ ,
and four of these new _UNK_ have solar panels .
And it &apos;s also true that all those people at home
We use Paul &apos;s model to work through community health workers ,
We estimate that the system needs five percent to six percent of GDP .
to keep this system alone in the world .
those of you who know about the health economy
should be aware of all the rich countries in health care .
the GDP of _UNK_ to _UNK_ . The United States voted for _UNK_ --
We &apos;re working with the health partners and the health sector in Rwanda .
in order to expand the system of this system .
We also began to implement this system in _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
have a similar plan , with other partner , to achieve the same dream ,
the fastest way to save life as much as possible ,
but it &apos;s a very powerful way to go across the country
and even within the world we can do it .
We need to be trained to train doctors , nurses ,
_UNK_ and community health care groups in the country ,
to deal with information technology , solar power ,
we &apos;re going to slow down the needs of the world
My vision is that TED can help us work , help us .
In Rwanda , the poor country founded a high quality country medical system ,
Even the world can be _UNK_ by any poor country .
I believe this will help us build a more _UNK_ world ,
a environment that we want to _UNK_ our children .
This is my privilege , especially in Rwanda .
We &apos;re still working with _UNK_ Tom _UNK_ now ,
to create a big economic plan to do it .
In the last year , we use our experience of AIDS ,
the cost of fertilizer and the credit rate down 30 percent ,
These people have experienced a lot , and we -- especially myself --
but they can &apos;t give them aid to stop their mutual _UNK_ .
We are trying to make it right now . And they &apos;ve lost the past , and we have the future .
I &apos;m trying to convince them that not to _UNK_ the electric grid
Now , instead of 35 percent of the population ,
but should be the use of clean energy , and the responsibility of _UNK_ trees .
The _UNK_ has a lot to do with their protection .
There &apos;s a batch of _UNK_ from the south farmer --
The first thing I did in that place
is _UNK_ and _UNK_ the local soil ,
And we have a chance to prove that
The world &apos;s aid to provide comprehensive , high quality healthcare .
I &apos;m not grateful for this big prize and will fully achieve my dream .
We need to be able to help you .
Think about what this means , if we can bring _UNK_ medical systems
to Rwanda , which is less than a dollar a day ,
to save the life of this system ,
and _UNK_ it to every country in the next decade .
It &apos;s worth our efforts and I believe we can succeed .
And I was the village that I had
I went to _UNK_ when I was 25 years old .
like a fairy tale , and then we retire .
And even though what he says is that part is true ,
They don &apos;t have the life that I &apos;ve ever had .
And I &apos;m going to use my _UNK_
And this is , the green green school .
Is he going to have more opportunities for him ?
We pay the bill at the end of the month ,
But the people who really pay the bill
These children have some _UNK_ on their desk ,
that they had to go to two classes .
We use electric power ; we don &apos;t care about it .
is the second _UNK_ that we &apos;re going to build in the world ,
with a lot of _UNK_ together --
No one wants to know them in the school .
But they work ; you can use them , and you &apos;re not all right .
We got some old glass , and we put it behind the iron ,
One day I met a father , and he looked crazy .
He said , &quot; I spent 24 hours on the plane . &quot;
He said , &quot; I &apos;ve had a dream of green school ,
And I saw a picture of this green school ,
so that their children can walk to school .
The pavement is full of _UNK_ and it will be submerged .
They found that the fence was done with the _UNK_ .
They brought the _UNK_ back into the kitchen ,
We &apos;re trying to stay around every classroom
The garden is in the garden of the garden .
But they knew something that was seldom unknown about rice .
They know how to _UNK_ and _UNK_ the cooking .
It &apos;s not a common lunch ; it &apos;s not a _UNK_ gas .
It &apos;s a _UNK_ that you can learn to read --
This is called the mud wrestling in the _UNK_ .
We &apos;ve done a lot of amazing things in our lifetime ,
And then we said , well , local . What is the point ?
20 percent of the people in the school
because these kids will be the next generation of green green green .
It &apos;s like the trains come out of the field .
It can be _UNK_ as high in two months .
When the architect came , they brought these things ,
The _UNK_ _UNK_ wants to be as modern as us ,
It may not be the largest _UNK_ building in the world ,
Green School is the model we built for the world .
You just need to get these simple solutions :
It &apos;s my talk , but it &apos;s not my voice .
I &apos;ve never been worried about my ability to speak .
I used to live in a _UNK_ _UNK_
Let me lose language , after the ability to eat food ,
and the computer became part of my life .
We can enjoy this wonderful thing at TED , and _UNK_ sounds .
And I could talk like this before .
and the behavior of talking or _UNK_ .
And when these capabilities are taken away ,
But I also found that the sound of the computer
So I decided to get some of my friends at TED
_UNK_ : &quot; And then the _UNK_ was with me
and I went back to the film that I had _UNK_ .
The doctor took a _UNK_ from my leg
I was going to go home two weeks ago .
Thank God , I was in the hospital ward ,
If that song is a little bit longer ,
I may have been in the car , and I &apos;m going to go home .
We need to have the ability to control and control the _UNK_ .
and the other side had to read what I wrote .
I &apos;ve tried to use a lot of computer sounds
A few months later , I had a British accent
when it sees the end of the period , it knows how to create something
It sounds like the end of the phrase , not the _UNK_ ,
It has all kinds of _UNK_ code that you use
to control the time and _UNK_ of the computer .
For me , there &apos;s a basic problem : they &apos;re too _UNK_ .
I have to quickly type and express myself
and I was waiting for the code ,
But what was added to our own voice ?
How do you add something to yourself instead of a machine ?
What is a feeling when I can &apos;t talk ?
When I left my computer , I would feel very comfortable .
In spite of that , I felt that most people
So _UNK_ suggested to find a company
And this is going to make me feel _UNK_ .
If the sound is not my own , it will be true .
But then I decided to do it again .
all the sound that they create is a real sound .
But they want to try and figure out
And so I sent them a lot of data
And that &apos;s why , because that &apos;s what I used to do .
The bands of their own television programs are not particularly useful .
because there &apos;s a lot of noise in it .
like the movie track , or the sound of _UNK_ and me , &quot;
I &apos;m going to give you an example of that .
These are some of the things that I did with _UNK_
Some comments were recorded by the _UNK_ show .
Roger _UNK_ : _UNK_ , can come back to your show
This is the first version of the computer .
I read what he could read with my voice .
This sound is a company developed in Scotland .
Now , you hear that a lot of these words are the first time
This is the first time they create sound for personal _UNK_ .
There are some very good sound for the computer ,
Most of the computers have built their own sound systems .
_UNK_ : Like you hear , it sounds like me .
My friends in Scotland are helping me improve .
In fact , it &apos;s got some information from Alex &apos;s _UNK_ .
He said he spent a long time playing all sorts of _UNK_
_UNK_ : &quot; In most of my life , I &apos;m a very _UNK_ .
I felt like the hero of the _UNK_ story
&quot; I don &apos;t have my mouth , but I want to cry . &quot;
In the universe , most of the time in the history of billions of years
There is a history of life on the planet .
This website provides a lot of subjects in the world .
I was a high school student , a local newspaper reporter
I was sent to the University of Illinois
and used to use the computer called _UNK_
The _UNK_ says that this system can help students learn
They even dream of the work that &apos;s done right now .
The point is that _UNK_ is just 50 years ago ,
He &apos;s constantly improving all kinds of forms , _UNK_ ,
The first Web browser is also in _UNK_ .
We &apos;re using a lot of virtual networks now .
And of course , I &apos;m not the _UNK_ here .
I came here as a person who was eager to communicate ,
I started writing to go back to 1970 ,
And when the first _UNK_ system is installed ,
When I told the Oscar _UNK_ to tell other people
They had the best wire to install a Internet ,
&quot; The Sun Times sent me to report the film festival .
I took a little _UNK_ computer with a suitcase ,
And indeed , it &apos;s very lucky to live in this history .
Now we live in the Internet in the days .
It creates a global awareness form of consciousness .
and my body would have suffered a pain .
My _UNK_ led me to a slow walk .
when people see people like me like this ,
I think I &apos;m sure I &apos;m not normal , this is human nature .
Some people don &apos;t want to communicate with me . &quot;
You should be able to get your wife to read this .
So , on the Web , I can actually express my real voice .
All these friends , are communicating with this way or so .
I tried to make myself feel happy and relief .
And if I keep in a position like this ,
_UNK_ : Wait a minute , I have the _UNK_ to say ,
Everybody knows that artificial intelligence test -- _UNK_ test --
If you can &apos;t tell who is the computer ,
I &apos;m going to make a computer sound -- I call it _UNK_ test .
Imagine the sound of the computer can be successful
and _UNK_ the same thing as the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I want to give this song to all South Africa --
the women who refused to bow out before race .
And of course , this song was also dedicated to my grandmother .
She played a lot of important role in my life .
especially when I was _UNK_ by the police ,
You probably remember _UNK_ in June , South Africa &apos;s students _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is used as a medium and force it .
And the students wanted to talk to the government
And then I was a little kid , about 11 years old .
to avoid the arrest of the police ,
They came to the nine or _UNK_ of June .
_UNK_ , the police come . Because they always arrest us .
and put us in jail , and maybe in June ,
It was June _UNK_ , _UNK_ came in , surrounded by _UNK_ .
And the grandmother turned off all the lights .
She said to them , &quot; _UNK_ &apos;s home tonight , but you don &apos;t want to take him .
I &apos;m really tired of you to _UNK_ us here .
And your children are in the house ,
He &apos;s here tonight , but you don &apos;t think of him .
I &apos;m ready to fill up a big _UNK_ of boiling water , who first enters me . &quot;
_UNK_ &apos;s mom , _UNK_ , a mom , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
And the tears of your eyes reminded me of my childhood .
I know that what you smile really means
through the dense fog of my ignorance .
Oh , dear mom is sleeping asleep in bed .
You &apos;re not good , and your heart is crying .
worry , worry , worry , worry about what &apos;s going to happen in the world .
How do we get kids to live alone ? No , no , no , no , no .
How do we try to find a problem for _UNK_ people ?
_UNK_ &apos;s mom , _UNK_ , a mom , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ &apos;s mom , _UNK_ , a mom , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
It will be easier for us to work tomorrow .
I started singing like a singer or a _UNK_ poet .
but it &apos;s hard to make me sing the _UNK_ bar .
My dear , my dear , my dear , my dear --
whether I should stop the _UNK_ of love ,
When my memory had been _UNK_ by the blood ?
Why are we sometimes _UNK_ the acne to think of cancer ?
Who is there a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ poem ?
I &apos;d like to sing a song about _UNK_ .
to the women who were pregnant still _UNK_
and they still have a healthy child .
And slowly , I grew up in the front of my big grin ,
And that _UNK_ me to love , to the _UNK_ of life ,
_UNK_ love , _UNK_ life , and _UNK_ love .
to celebrate life , to celebrate the lives of life ,
Oh , I stopped the singing of the songs .
I heard a sound that was more powerful than the enemy bomb .
It was a _UNK_ to _UNK_ our blood song .
_UNK_ love , _UNK_ life , and _UNK_ love .
to celebrate life , to celebrate the love of love ,
_UNK_ life , _UNK_ love -- everybody &apos;s singing to me .
_UNK_ life , _UNK_ , _UNK_ life -- everybody &apos;s singing with me .
to celebrate life , to celebrate love --
_UNK_ love , _UNK_ life -- a little more loud .
_UNK_ life , _UNK_ love -- don &apos;t stop , don &apos;t stop .
_UNK_ love , praise life , for the sake of love ,
I &apos;m going to ask you to call it a little more loud .
_UNK_ life , _UNK_ love , _UNK_ life , _UNK_ love .
You don &apos;t stop , don &apos;t stop , stop _UNK_ -- love .
Ah , _UNK_ . _UNK_ . _UNK_ love . _UNK_ love . _UNK_ love . _UNK_ love .
_UNK_ love , _UNK_ life . singing . _UNK_ love , _UNK_ life sing .
_UNK_ love , _UNK_ life . singing . _UNK_ love , _UNK_ life .
The reader doesn &apos;t want to pay the news yesterday &apos;s news , no readers , of course , are willing to buy ads .
is much easier than to read a New York Times .
So we can &apos;t ask , &quot; Is there any way to save it from _UNK_ ? &quot;
Or the future newspapers should be _UNK_ in the market like commercial _UNK_ .
because we began to hear the radio in the car ,
Then you check your email at work and you &apos;ll see TV after work .
I can &apos;t see what &apos;s going to happen ,
In the former Soviet Union the newspaper was written .
After years , they issued a few newspapers in Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe .
There was no vision culture , of course , no vision budget ,
There is no _UNK_ in many places even in the _UNK_ .
And I decided to work for them , as a _UNK_ guide .
Before this job , I was an architect , my grandmother had asked me ,
My grandmother said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? It &apos;s just a _UNK_ letter , what is the good design ? &quot;
And unfortunately , my grandmother was right . I was very depressed , until a day ,
I went to London and enjoyed the _UNK_ of the Sun .
to become the highest level of performance art . &quot;
So I _UNK_ , &quot; Oh my God , maybe I can do the same thing on these _UNK_ newspapers ! &quot;
So I started , a _UNK_ of _UNK_ them .
And this is a pipe that I &apos;m talking to the reader .
I &apos;m not going to tell you what the groups are working on ,
&quot; The Year &apos;s best front front front page of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a rhythm , and it &apos;s got a _UNK_ .
We &apos;re going to move two _UNK_ as a whole page ,
So what you see here is some of these Russian newspapers ,
And the real prize is from the international _UNK_ .
just after a year of _UNK_ design ,
But what &apos;s really amazing is that these winning newspapers
In the same way , the _UNK_ grew _UNK_ ,
After a long time of _UNK_ , the newspapers were selling
What we do is not just change the appearance of a newspaper ,
I took the &quot; functions and the principle of _UNK_ , &quot;
And before the _UNK_ , the plan is also important .
First of all , what are we going to do , what are the goals ?
We will begin to design after two months .
Why would I ask all of these newspapers ,
But soon they knew that this was a new role in designers ,
The final process of design design is to be involved in the whole process .
The first topic is to understand that design is not only your product ,
The design can also change the process , in fact , design can change everything in your company .
is that you can live in a small and poor country ,
and you can still show the highest level of work .
And you have to remember , it &apos;s just like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
I &apos;ve not mentioned it for about four years .
I went home and brought my dog to me
When I was ready to run with my dog ,
took out his car keys and sat in the car .
I felt that there was a hand explosion in my head
I remember putting my hands on the ground
He ran a red light and bumped into my dog .
And my _UNK_ was _UNK_ by the wheels .
My blood is _UNK_ out of my mouth .
and they tried to _UNK_ my heart .
It was wise that there was a _UNK_ in my neck
I open my _UNK_ so that I can absorb some air
So someone opens my chest and put a pin on it .
In fact , they have already called the _UNK_ .
I did a lot of surgery to repair my neck .
to make my foot try to move like normal people .
And I had a plastic nose , full of _UNK_ teeth .
But sometimes it &apos;s a little bit about these things ,
for some of the patients that might have saved
and all of us lost confidence in my rehabilitation .
So they just had a map on the wall , a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ was nailed up to a home in _UNK_ .
I know that you &apos;re all _UNK_ up here :
&quot; _UNK_ ? Why do you go to your home ? &quot;
Now all the skills and talent in this room
And one of the biggest _UNK_ of yours
And then I had the wisdom of life
I was standing up with a white stick .
And the other hand has a suitcase with full medical records .
So they went back and looked at each other .
And then they started talking , &quot; Okay , what are we going to do ?
But the first thing they need to do
because I &apos;ve been carrying a tube in my chest
So I had to go back and try to eat things .
She slept in the corner of the apartment . &quot;
We don &apos;t talk about how they force me to make _UNK_
But I refused to clear the blue hair .
They decided that I needed to learn how to speak ,
If you don &apos;t know how to talk , and you can &apos;t see things .
So they thought that nothing was going to be seen .
when I was taught to speak in the daytime ,
But for me , I was an adult , and I was embarrassed .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ the sound of the sound .
They wanted me to make it interesting .
So at night they teach me to play a spelling game .
So I want you to think about it .
a teacher who has been a young age
to teach me the task of writing ,
So I had to go through two problems
Every time I &apos;m close to the _UNK_ or _UNK_ ,
to figure out how to go through the street ,
So one of the older people came up
She pushed me to the east and said ,
&quot; When you think it should be , it &apos;s just going to take the _UNK_ out .
They realized that they needed to _UNK_ the resources
And so I could go to _UNK_ school
because the old people are going to invest in me
and the _UNK_ and the skills I get
These things I &apos;ve never seen before before .
And instead of the feeling of what you feel about .
And I see the kind of thing in the room
And I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to go to it . &quot;
The biggest change to me is to look at my hand .
and I saw that I lost 10 years
I don &apos;t know why it seems to be in the same time .
And I realized that the time was going on
We don &apos;t have a word like a group of resources or totally cooperative .
A farmer , the morning , was in the market ,
and found that a young man was _UNK_ on the ground ,
He was a famous _UNK_ in Paris at the time .
The death of his brother in the hospital the next day .
And what he ended up saying to his brother ,
but a few years ago , when he was still in school ,
But the _UNK_ doesn &apos;t know anything he wrote .
This is how he wrote most of the mathematical theories .
And so he was _UNK_ , and he kept writing things ,
As the dawn came , he was ready to meet his fate .
He left a pile of papers on the table to the next generation .
Maybe he &apos;s going to study math all night ,
was that he was shot in the morning and was killed .
In _UNK_ , you don &apos;t really want to study symmetry .
The present pig flu virus is a kind of symmetry virus .
But the symmetry is really important in biology ,
I took two pictures here and they made symmetry .
If I ask you what you think is more beautiful ,
So if you can make yourself _UNK_ , then you &apos;re moving a signal
It means you get good genetic genes , you have good _UNK_ ,
So , symmetry is a language that can help transmission
What is happening in the _UNK_ Institute of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
or the big _UNK_ particle at the physics of Europe .
to be able to predict the fundamental particles ,
It seems that all _UNK_ have some strange _UNK_ shape .
and familiar with the characteristics of the writing .
The letters are triangle , circle and other geometric figures ,
not just scientists are interested in symmetry .
They have some more _UNK_ relationships with symmetry .
This is Thomas _UNK_ in the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
He said , &quot; He was blown by the perfect precision of it ,
But what artists wanted to do was to create _UNK_ expectations ,
is that when I went to my colleagues
He took me to the temple in _UNK_ .
And after this photograph , we walk up the stairs ,
There are eight pillars , and they have beautiful symmetry design .
&quot; Wow , the building is definitely going to kick himself ,
If the _UNK_ found such a mistake , _UNK_ the post . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , no , no , no , no , no . This is a really cool design . &quot;
And he gave me this lovely quote , _UNK_ ,
And the _UNK_ gives a sense of _UNK_ space . &quot;
But if I had to choose a building in the world ,
put it into a island , and I &apos;m going to spend it there ,
As a person who is _UNK_ , I may choose _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
We did not have an academic trip , and my family loved it .
He really liked our math journey in _UNK_ .
I think one of the problems that schools teach
It doesn &apos;t focus on how the math is being _UNK_ .
So , I want to open up his _UNK_ and let him know
But all the exciting things happened on the walls .
What is symmetry ? When there &apos;s two walls there ,
that can answer some of these problems .
to move it in a way that it looks like
I like to describe this as a _UNK_ movement .
What can you do to some things ? close your eyes .
So , for example , the walls of the _UNK_ .
I can take all these tiles , put them in this yellow place ,
and they put them back , and they &apos;re very _UNK_ .
If you open your eyes , you don &apos;t know they &apos;re moving .
but it was movement that made symmetry .
but also to create a language to describe it .
to turn something else into another , to turn the geometric language .
So , I &apos;m going to take you through , and maybe I &apos;ll give you some math ,
on some mathematical knowledge that you know how this language works ,
How can I make this _UNK_ look like the original ?
Well , I _UNK_ it up and down ,
It looks like it &apos;s still the same thing I &apos;ve done before .
I can rotate it a third of the circle ,
_UNK_ it back to _UNK_ , or rotating two - thirds .
The fifth symmetry , I can rotate it to six points .
And these are what I did in _UNK_ ,
It can make it look the same before I move them .
For _UNK_ , there is actually a sixth symmetry .
And you can think about what other ways
can it be the same way I did it ?
I can &apos;t rotate it because I &apos;ve _UNK_ it up , right ?
But what I can do is put it in the _UNK_ ,
For _UNK_ , this is like a _UNK_ symmetry .
It was a very modern concept that it was invented in the _UNK_ century .
This is the same idea . This is symmetry --
So everything has a symmetry , put it in place .
Well , I can rotate it for a third ,
I can rotate it in the X _UNK_ ,
five symmetry , and of course , there &apos;s a _UNK_ symmetry ,
I took it up and put it back on the previous site .
Now , I really believe math is not a _UNK_ movement ,
I &apos;m going to give you a prize after the lecture .
to the very close person to the answer .
How many ways you can move this object ,
and it &apos;s still going to look like a symbol ?
OK ? I want to continue with the lecture , you can think about it ,
There will be a prize for the answer to the end of the lecture .
Let &apos;s go back to the symmetry of these two objects .
_UNK_ realized that this was not just the symmetry of individual ,
If I do a fantastic _UNK_ , then I do one more ,
to see the inner meaning of things that are invisible ,
So I gave them names . _UNK_ , B , C , E , E , F , F , F , F , F , F , F , F .
It is located in the _UNK_ of the sea star .
So , if I rotate B , I turn it back ,
The second is the C , a third of the circle ?
Well , let &apos;s start with it . The _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The effect of the _UNK_ is like I just _UNK_ it .
I &apos;m going to rotate one of the _UNK_ , and it turns out
What happens if I rotate the other order ?
Let &apos;s see . Let &apos;s rotate a third of the circle , then rotating the _UNK_ .
A kind of symmetry is done by each other .
But the symmetry of the triangle is completely different .
Let &apos;s see if you look at the triangle ,
Let &apos;s rotate a third of the circle ,
Well , the effect of _UNK_ is like I just _UNK_ it .
And then the _UNK_ _UNK_ a third circle .
The effect of the _UNK_ is completely different from the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s like _UNK_ over the Y _UNK_ .
Now this seems to be about the order of your operation .
there are six . So , why don &apos;t we say
You can try and , when you go to the bar , you go after that .
Take a _UNK_ , _UNK_ it around a quarter ,
and then flip it . And then do it in other order ,
The picture of the wine will be to your face .
The _UNK_ of these _UNK_ and _UNK_ have studied some laws .
And by using those laws , he can say ,
And these six symmetry are going to be _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s almost the idea of being _UNK_ .
In front of this , I asked one , two , three people
But numbers , the abstract concept of numbers are the same .
Now we can see this : we go back to the walls of _UNK_ .
We can know that these things have abstract symmetry .
and a little bit of a triangle , a little bit _UNK_ .
And you can rotate them up and down ,
If you ignore their color . We &apos;re not matching color .
But in the matching shape , if I spin them up ,
What is the center of the triangle ? I can do it .
the center of the triangle _UNK_ them a third circle ,
There &apos;s an interesting place here , and it &apos;s half a while along the side .
So , half the rotating along the side , they all match .
Now , let &apos;s move a wall that looks very different .
We see the same symmetry and the same thing here .
That &apos;s the _UNK_ . It &apos;s a third of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s half a circle away from six _UNK_ and half .
But the symmetry of these things is exactly the same .
This is a _UNK_ , the ceiling and the floor .
They all look very different . But this language allows us to say
They are the same kind of _UNK_ object ,
We call _UNK_ . This is not going to have a football relationship ,
but because they have two of them that you can rotate
a quarter of the circle and a half circle .
Now , the power of this language is more powerful ,
&quot; Moore &apos;s artist found that all of the possible _UNK_
You can get different symmetry on the walls of the _UNK_ .
And they , if you try to make a different wall ,
This _UNK_ must be the same in 17 _UNK_ .
The full development of _UNK_ or five dimensions of space .
So , I think this is a great example of what you can &apos;t see ,
The force of math language allows you to create .
So , like _UNK_ , I was all night in the night ,
But it &apos;s not a real picture . I can put my _UNK_
So I want to give you a chance to _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The Moon may be hit and _UNK_ --
What you &apos;re going to do is to answer my question at the beginning .
but not everybody comes out , I want you to count how many numbers .
If you get a 120 - _UNK_ , then you &apos;re going to expand your 120 .
If you think you &apos;ve already estimated how many numbers are ,
If you go on , then he will win it .
OK . OK . We have four , five , six , six .
OK . That &apos;s great . Let &apos;s go on . OK .
The answer to you is that you have to sit down .
_UNK_ or less . So if your answer is _UNK_ , you have to sit down .
You must sit down at 60 or 60 numbers .
Let &apos;s ask other people , who estimate it &apos;s 20 , please stand up again ?
If I tell you that twenty or twenty , please stand up .
because this one . I think there are some people .
OK , how many of your answers are ?
21 . OK . How many of you are ?
In fact , the answer to the _UNK_ &apos;s cube
in the math language . You can &apos;t use that name .
_UNK_ , this is the name . This is your new symmetry .
I have a project that is for charity in _UNK_ ,
I can stay late to invent a object ,
You can help _UNK_ kids to get educated .
And I think that as a mathematician ,
to my drive is something that we haven &apos;t found yet .
They &apos;re all _UNK_ , and it makes math a real theme .
I was always reminded of the word &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot;
_UNK_ and give people a sense of space . &quot; Thank you .
and we enjoy a lot of things today .
We &apos;re showing a lot of things at TED .
Now let &apos;s go back to the very early days
And they had a grinding mill at the time
And this is a more serious person
We are now changing our teeth as well .
But I think it &apos;s going to be a Neanderthal
is based on the location of your ancestors ,
to have a strong respect to the consequences of no consciousness .
And there &apos;s a very healthy _UNK_ that you see
&quot; I can &apos;t treat it , I &apos;m not going to take it . &quot;
to tell you how important the damage is .
the field of death has changed into a medical field .
that have the bright future of hope
and he would never be the right thing .
and it went down to the _UNK_ of the world .
and invented the most complex machine --
because it can be equal to the _UNK_ .
And unfortunately , he was _UNK_ by the blow ,
In the early century , there were some events
And for many years , _UNK_ is a lesson
_UNK_ had a ship sank in _UNK_ , Chicago ,
This is actually a system , how the ships are _UNK_ .
But it might be one of the greatest inventions
And that was a great use in the Second World War .
Many of the drugs that were produced at the time
and became one of the greatest medical improvements
and the interference of the research that we see
Now , when we came to the Second World War ,
But it &apos;s _UNK_ , and the air circulation ,
a _UNK_ tape player is like a disease .
The tin particles fall into the magnetic parts of the tape .
So this shows that we &apos;re all involved in
So in our age , a typical question is
And although in the form of disaster ,
and found that the _UNK_ invented in other inventions
the greatest 10 years in the world --
They have _UNK_ with the invention of _UNK_ --
but he couldn &apos;t find any other _UNK_ work .
So this is the best job he can find .
And he was a little bit more _UNK_
We live in a time where there is a possibility
Think about the big problems we have now --
that are used to solve the problems of the problem .
The _UNK_ diseases in the silk industry are studied .
and became the problem of Europe at that time --
We &apos;re going to see what he can do for us .
We need to learn from Dr. _UNK_ ,
He made some mistakes , and he was his fault .
And they might not be doing it all the time .
maybe it could be done a little bit earlier .
I think in computer interface , we seem to be in the _UNK_ era .
For example , computer interface is not supposed to have depth , and it &apos;s hard to _UNK_ people .
OK . You see , this is the current standard interface , right ?
Yes , we can dressed it , make it seem more beautiful apples .
But in fact , this is still the old _UNK_ that used to use ,
I mean , I think there &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ in our computer .
For example , click , menu , icon , are always these things , _UNK_ .
However , there is a message space , my real desk , bringing me inspiration .
It &apos;s more _UNK_ , and it &apos;s going to go deeper
I &apos;d like to take my desk experience to the computer table .
And so there &apos;s it -- it &apos;s got a _UNK_ .
This is a new thought of a computer desktop .
So you hit something -- they really take control , you can put them in a random way .
And so they don &apos;t have to click , and it &apos;s more like _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
They &apos;re going to hit together . It &apos;s like in real desk .
I can -- let me grab these things -- I can make them _UNK_ ,
And these are stack , and I can _UNK_ them up ,
or you look at it like a _UNK_ ,
or they &apos;re going to be _UNK_ like _UNK_ .
After opening , I can turn something to new location , or remove them .
and you can _UNK_ things up , like that .
And all movement has smooth animation , not all of the sudden changes in the _UNK_ interface .
In addition , what do you want to do if you want to _UNK_ something ?
I just want to throw it over , so it &apos;s going to be nice .
In addition , we can also be able to
-- to say to these images --
How do we _UNK_ the icon and make it go further ?
One of the ways is to make the icon bigger .
so that it can stress it , make it seem more important .
But the real cool point is that these _UNK_ add physical _UNK_ ,
So the bigger icon is _UNK_ . So the light _UNK_ it .
But if I throw the heavy drop on the light , look !
It &apos;s fun . But it &apos;s a very ingenious way to transmit information .
This is a heavy , so it &apos;s more important . It &apos;s really cool .
because the paper has a lot of good features .
We also want to apply some features to our system _UNK_ .
So , the icon we designed can _UNK_ the same _UNK_ .
is the same thing as the real paper .
Or , you really want to destroy it , and you get it wrong ,
and you can put these things on the wall ,
Like in the office , people put the notes on the wall .
And when I use them , I can take them off the wall .
So , one of these _UNK_ ideas is that
&quot; But my desktop is _UNK_ enough , I don &apos;t want to get the desktop _UNK_ . &quot;
In this opinion , we design the right - sided functions ,
So you can get the traditional computer table . All objects are neatly arranged .
It &apos;s rather _UNK_ , but it &apos;s still going to hit , jump and so on .
And you can do some interesting work , like , put it on the table .
We &apos;ll try this _UNK_ . Okay , this is the _UNK_ .
I think that &apos;s another really cool application field of software --
I think it can be used on other elements -- like _UNK_ .
And I think this is a great experience for us to look at this picture .
You can put the picture on the shelf , or look like a picture of your own dining table .
I can put these objects all around . They have very texture --
I can also look at it in a particular object .
I can also do it in front of me .
I can take them all together and look at them ,
So , we put this picture in the back , and we _UNK_ it here .
I think this information is more rich and more _UNK_ .
And he was in Argentina , in Argentina ,
But there &apos;s also _UNK_ ingredients . And there &apos;s a lot of work after the film .
to follow the changes of the Dow _UNK_ .
to the deep valley in the mountains .
with these lines , and I &apos;m going to suggest
We _UNK_ things out of the world .
to actually start to shape the world --
the world around us and the inner world .
I &apos;ve been thinking about it all the time ,
A few years ago on the flight of the Atlantic ,
And in the Cold War , the Hungarian ,
And he said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re mainly trying to get the contact aircraft . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Okay . It &apos;s interesting .
It &apos;s a little bit to learn how to work with the contact plane .
In the sky the radar signal is _UNK_ in the sky .
But if you can take this big thing ,
If you are radar , it &apos;s really a bad job .
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot; He said , &quot; If you are radar .
We built a black box to detect electronic signals ,
When we see a _UNK_ of electrons ,
we think that this may be relevant to the United States .
He said , &quot; Well , now there are 2,000 physicists working on Wall Street ,
I said , &quot; What is the Wall Street _UNK_ ? &quot;
whether it &apos;s _UNK_ or _UNK_ , whatever it is --
It &apos;s kind of like playing _UNK_ , all the bargaining chips .
And so they had to find a way --
in the last millions of years of math
to find hundreds of thousands of small things ,
and figure out what happened in the market .
to show the images of the current market ,
What you can show is a group of people
A group was set to find and implement the algorithm .
The entire market has gone for five minutes ,
This is called the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
And all of a sudden , the _UNK_ is gone ,
It was _UNK_ to everyone that happened the day .
We &apos;re writing things that we don &apos;t know .
The market data , sometimes are some algorithms .
And when they find these data , they take the data out .
It &apos;s like a butterfly nailed them to the wall .
to deal with the data that we can &apos;t understand --
This is not only in the stock market .
Once you know how to find them ,
You can find it here : this is a book about flies .
You might have seen this book on the Amazon .
If you buy it at _UNK_ , it &apos;s cheap .
No one has bought or sell anything ; what happens ?
There is no doubt the same thing in Wall Street .
And as the Amazon , the _UNK_ has this problem .
They started using _UNK_ , and then they tried some other things .
is that we don &apos;t really have to have it ,
Well , some scientists from Britain are in Hollywood ,
And this is not a Google thing .
They &apos;re in your house , and they &apos;re in your house .
There are two algorithms _UNK_ your living room .
They have a very different understanding of the _UNK_ meaning .
and you can see it in a very different way .
It &apos;s kind of a secret architect in your bedroom .
You &apos;re going to press before you go into the elevator .
They tried to get into the elevator and had no confusion .
I want to go to the 10 th floor ,
The people who want to go into five _UNK_ .
and show that the numbers that are going down
What can it do ? Can it be _UNK_ ?
Let &apos;s go back to the Wall Street .
to give you a little sense of _UNK_ ,
You have to look for an architect that I &apos;ve seen in _UNK_
to throw away all the furniture and the human use ,
to be ready for a lot of servers --
Think of the Internet as a distributed system .
And of course , it &apos;s , but it &apos;s in different places .
In New York , it &apos;s distributed in New York :
This is where the cable really enters the city .
In fact , the more you go from this place ,
No one could be like the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s 37 times the speed of transmission signals --
And unfortunately , we were in front of us .
If you &apos;re going to make money in the market , those red dots are in place ,
is going to put the servers in the _UNK_
You might have noticed that these are the _UNK_
and a lot of it is in the ocean .
So what we &apos;re going to do is build some bubbles ,
in fact , it doesn &apos;t mean that money is money .
they &apos;re not _UNK_ , but it &apos;s a prediction .
But now there are three sides of _UNK_ : algorithms --
We &apos;ll have to think of these things as nature .
So I have to say that I &apos;m going to go quickly .
It &apos;s a little _UNK_ , because it &apos;s a lot of _UNK_
And I got a _UNK_ from 27 years ago ,
40 percent of the incidence of car accidents
As long as the traffic is _UNK_ , the driver will not step forward .
and you don &apos;t accelerate , you don &apos;t waste fuel pollution .
This is what I live in the community .
These ring - shaped rings are light and light _UNK_ .
If we don &apos;t have them , we &apos;ll lose a lot , so let &apos;s think about it .
And I &apos;ve been working on this guy
And what does that mean to me ?
every pedal will consume two _UNK_ per pedal .
It costs five cents a day , so it &apos;s 3,000 cents a day .
It &apos;s just _UNK_ , and I &apos;m going to go to _UNK_
It &apos;s eight times a day of _UNK_
The average annual wage is 20 dollars a year .
_UNK_ oil is about two billion dollars .
to add five percent of inflation in recent years .
and look at the intersection of the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ the bush to open up the visual view .
And we can &apos;t figure out why ? Why ?
Why are you going to have a sign in every direction ?
because it &apos;s important . Is there any better way ?
because there are a lot of households there
and it &apos;s going to take a long line of cars
because the speed of the car on the _UNK_
The road is a long way off .
_UNK_ &quot; appeared in 1950 . We only have these two signs .
because it means that the thread is going to leave
That means you have five cars , and you have to wait .
until that five car is open , you can walk ,
So , the current traffic _UNK_ is hard to make new meaning .
and see &quot; Let &apos;s not make it go . &quot;
The new sign is still _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
is the &quot; stop &quot; and &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
is the &quot; T &quot; _UNK_ &quot; --
when people are uncertain about the environment of _UNK_ ,
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re trying to do now .
but don &apos;t expect it to be fast , this process is always _UNK_ .
And you can all contribute to environmental protection .
You &apos;re going to be able to improve traffic tools . Thank you .
All the problems are going to be solved .
that the body is _UNK_ in the body .
So the light needs to help the lighting .
The operation was always beginning in the morning
For example , this is the oldest operating room in the Western world ,
This is one of the most famous hospitals in the United States ,
Do you know where the operating room is built ?
because we don &apos;t need to have a _UNK_ .
learning anatomy from the body of the body ,
That &apos;s too easy to , so every person can do a surgeon , right ?
But when we had a real patient lying in the operating table ,
that the _UNK_ can be used in surgery
I don &apos;t care if the tumor has this gene , that gene .
or this protein , the protein , the protein ,
and the feeling of the tumor and the feeling ,
the relationship between it and other body structure , based on all our experience ,
Well , we took the tumor out of it .
This is a surgeon in the operating room
But we don &apos;t know whether the tumor has been completely _UNK_ .
We need to take samples from the operating table
to the _UNK_ , to the lab of the brain ,
At the same time , the patient lay on the stage of the surgery .
_UNK_ , cutting , take a microscope , a look at it ,
And every sample is going to take 20 minutes
&quot; Do you know ? A point and B is _UNK_ ,
But there are some residual tumors on the top .
So we go back and do it again and again .
And we found that there were several places
So we had to first tell the patient
to know whether the tumor is all except for it .
I mean , in many ways , we &apos;re now working ,
And he got the Nobel Prize for _UNK_ ,
The main part is this blue part , called _UNK_ ,
and put it into a vein in the cancer patient ,
So when these two together , the molecule is neutral ,
If you make a solution with these three molecules ,
and you add the dyes and you get green .
We knew the spot in the operating room .
where the tumor is , what doctors need to do ,
and they need to do a lot of work
And so even if the tumor doesn &apos;t shine ,
In fact , the surface is normal muscles , see it ?
Even if it &apos;s not in the top of it ,
has changed the way we treat breast cancer and _UNK_ .
The tumor first _UNK_ the node to the _UNK_ .
If that node doesn &apos;t have a tumor ,
But what we do today is we do a _UNK_ node
You want to know where the next station is .
Your map will show a gas station in front of you .
You have to take the _UNK_ and bring home ,
but at once we can know it .
You see there &apos;s a lot of tiny _UNK_ here .
Who do we have a _UNK_ node in the middle ?
with the _UNK_ _UNK_ and the _UNK_ node ,
We can use the same AI for three dollars .
And we want to do that in the beginning ,
a lot of people have a lot of problems --
And that means that the surgeon has realized the problem ,
But do you know ? These nerves are in
because someone has done it , we can understand it .
_UNK_ tumor , but don &apos;t know where the tumor is , it &apos;s insane .
We try to protect nerves , but we don &apos;t know where nerves are .
In the beginning , there are no people to support me .
Some people say , &quot; We &apos;ve done this for years .
Here you see the _UNK_ of a mouse ,
The part is so large that it is easy to see .
But actually , from the top of my _UNK_ ,
You see , this looks like a small _UNK_ head _UNK_ outside .
the face , the face of the face , the movement and the breath .
Do you know where the edge of the tumor is ?
So what is the nerve in this tumor ?
But what is the part of the tumor ?
I think this will change the way we are now _UNK_ .
The National Science of Science in the National _UNK_ .
And we showed a lot of the _UNK_
And I think that &apos;s going to work for me
We know it can be done , we can do our best .
And finally , what I want to share with you
is that innovation is not from individuals .
And that &apos;s what I want to share with you .
You wake up in the morning , and you feel cool and cool your cheek .
And when you find new things , you &apos;re _UNK_ .
But I &apos;m sure there are some things you don &apos;t think about today --
but you may be totally _UNK_ of what &apos;s going on .
The brain doesn &apos;t look like the appearance of the appearance --
and let &apos;s go further into the brain ,
and understand the complexity of the brain .
and it &apos;s hard to imagine the complex circuitry
which is made of less different components --
We know how they work because we designed them --
The brain is composed of thousands of different cells
They differentiate into different shapes ; they produce different molecules ;
They expand and connect the different parts of the brain .
They also show different ways of looking at different diseases .
A smaller , _UNK_ cell , that can suppress the cells around them .
This is a _UNK_ cell that leads to _UNK_ symptoms .
It &apos;s about thousands of cells that we &apos;re working on .
They &apos;re distributed in many parts of the brain
It may lead to disease like _UNK_ because of excessive activity .
It &apos;s just going to take a little bit of time
How are we going to explain how these circuitry works ?
to _UNK_ different cells and _UNK_ them .
If we can activate cells , we can understand what energy they can release .
we may be able to figure out what they need .
This is the story I &apos;m going to tell you today .
is to be honest , to be honest ,
to control the circuitry of the brain , the part of the tissue ,
The bad news is the _UNK_ of our _UNK_ .
They not only _UNK_ our lives and _UNK_ our meaning .
The development of the _UNK_ industry is some hope
There was no disease that was thought to be healing .
And part of it is because our brain _UNK_ in chemistry
is made up of thousands of different types of cells .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s for , most of the drugs in the market , not all .
will lead to some serious side effects .
to improve some of the diseases that are happening .
But the current will go to four _UNK_ --
And this is the _UNK_ , the part of the _UNK_ ,
The current does not only affect the cells that we need to repair .
Can we transmit information accurately to where we want it ?
When I started studying neuroscience 11 years ago ,
I was trained to become an electrical engineer and a physicist
And what we &apos;re going to do is find some ways
If we can stimulate a single cell ,
then we have a tool to activate and close all kinds of cells .
to understand how they work and how they work .
And that gives us a very precise control
There are a lot of molecules in nature .
If we can inject these molecules into nerves ,
These neurons can lead to the electrical component of the _UNK_ .
the cells that don &apos;t accept molecules around them ,
And there &apos;s another _UNK_ that you need to know ,
is to inject light into the brain .
So , the brain doesn &apos;t feel pain -- you can --
like the Internet and the functions of communication --
to activate , like the cells of animals ,
There is a particular _UNK_ of algae in nature .
This protein is like I told you that solar cell works .
When the blue light hits , it opens a _UNK_
And so the _UNK_ had an electrical signal .
It &apos;s like picking a battery into a solar cell .
What we need to do is to extract these molecules
is that the DNA code of the organism
So what we &apos;re going to do is to extract DNA
into a gene carrier , like a virus ,
And it turns out that genes are a very direct way
and it turns out that the _UNK_ of the operation
In the summer of 2004 , one morning
And we did this , and the first attempt to get _UNK_
you extract DNA and put it into nerves
you have a neuron that has a _UNK_ .
is to try to get these genes into your needs .
You can do it ; you can transform these viruses
to get them to some cells that are involved in other cells .
Now the field is called the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So , for example , what you &apos;re going to do ,
that we use a virus to transmit this gene
in a dense cell area only for a cell
And then when you look at the entire area ,
For example , it &apos;s going to be a little easier .
If we can inject genes into these cells --
And they &apos;re not going to change the genes --
And then you use the blue light to the brain ,
And when there &apos;s no light , these cells are normal cells .
There is no bad consequences in the world .
not only can you understand the function of these cells
in the brain , the _UNK_ of the brain
And you can also try to solve --
Maybe we can activate the activity of these cells ,
Now I want to tell you a little story
is , what kind of signal does the brain represent a reward ?
And that signal that drives the cells to learn ,
the brain will give a lot of reward
And it &apos;s also a signal that causes diseases like this .
If we can figure out what cells are ,
to design or choose drugs to fight against disease .
or finding the _UNK_ where it &apos;s going to work .
In order to do this , we came up with a simple example
If the animal is here , it will be _UNK_ .
to difference between the _UNK_ of different cells .
the animal will turn right and use the nose ,
And every time it does that , it &apos;s going to have a blue light .
And then it would repeat hundreds of times
Some of you may have heard about it in the center of the brain .
Now we &apos;re going to show you a quick step
Each fiber has its own own own tiny light source .
And then we &apos;re going to experiment on organisms
the experiments that have been done in the _UNK_ --
to make sure what particular signal can trigger .
And the other thing I want to talk about
How do we search for the target cells to cure _UNK_ _UNK_ --
to accept a classic terrorist model --
The electrode is not pain , but it &apos;s annoying .
Over the years -- for example , the mouse
is a good animal , which is widely used in _UNK_ --
Now the question is , what are the goals in the brain
And what we did is we did it again .
But we activate the target cells in the brain , every different location ,
to show you the pictures of the fiber array ,
to try to figure out how to overcome the brain
the fear of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
to show you some of the _UNK_ cells that we &apos;re studying
a block that allows us to overcome the emotional areas
The animal will hear the same noise -- and the light of the light .
The light doesn &apos;t touch the sound , but you can see the _UNK_ response .
And there &apos;s a little alarm on the _UNK_ .
You can see that mice use about two minutes
the same sound , and the same light is coming again .
As you can see , only 10 minutes of experiments
And we &apos;re using this part of the brain ,
In the last few years , we are looking back
because we want to find ways to control the brain
If we can control , it might be very influential .
If you let the cells fail even a few seconds or a few seconds ,
to understand the brain circuitry that they are in place .
Now we &apos;ve been investigating all the organisms --
In addition to animals , we have no significant differences .
We found that all kinds of molecules were named as _UNK_ _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
Their response is the _UNK_ that I mentioned before .
I &apos;ll give you an example of the specific situation .
The other way is to remove that part of the brain
But it &apos;s obviously _UNK_ , and it &apos;s going to cause side effects .
And if we let the part of the brain _UNK_ a little bit ,
and let the brain back to the early stages --
It &apos;s like taking a active system into a stable system .
And this animation is just to explain
We can use light to control the idea
And it &apos;s just going to be able to remove symptoms .
And we want to experiment to be successful
And we haven &apos;t shown it for a moment ,
If you can control these _UNK_ proteins ,
to form a new arm , an optical value .
And I said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s not universal .
The other thing is that you &apos;re going to get these genes into cells
The new hope for the treatment of genes
and probably most of us have a _UNK_
to get genes into the brain or in the body .
And so far , there &apos;s no brain for this virus ,
And the last thing to focus on is that protein itself
Most of our brains have no fungi or algae .
What if we put them into the brain ?
Are we going to _UNK_ it ? Should the immune system respond ?
In the early days -- we didn &apos;t test it in the human body --
So far , we don &apos;t have these molecules or molecules
and the worst response to the _UNK_ ,
And this is the preliminary study , even so , we &apos;re very excited .
The damage of the light receptor in our eye .
Our retina is a very complicated structure .
And we &apos;re going to zoom in and look at it .
The _UNK_ receptor in the top of the picture
by the _UNK_ receptor to receive the optical signals
and eventually _UNK_ out , from the _UNK_ cells ,
There is no evidence that drug can be treated with these diseases .
because it &apos;s not going to be a _UNK_
But the light is still going into the eye .
_UNK_ or _UNK_ , you can see the light coming in .
So if we could put these _UNK_ _UNK_ and other molecules
to get into the cells that are normal .
because there are lots of cells in the eye
and it &apos;s going to be the U.S. Health Institute
Now what you see is a mouse walking through the Maze
It &apos;s six arms in the Maze , and there &apos;s some _UNK_ in the Maze .
to stimulate mice , or it &apos;s going to stay somewhere .
is to get the flow into a stream
The mice were smart , and eventually came out of the Maze ,
It _UNK_ every branch of the branch to find the platform .
They represent the lack of _UNK_ symptoms of human beings .
So we have a very careful exploration of different kinds of blind _UNK_ .
we &apos;re going to tell you exactly what &apos;s going on before .
a layer of cells that are going to be
It &apos;s like the neurons are filled with solar cells .
And this mouse took a few weeks ago ,
Only once accepted a virus with a _UNK_ receptor .
You can see that mice can avoid the walls
And these animals go to the platform for a while ,
is the same thing that doesn &apos;t have any blind object .
Finally , I want to point out that we &apos;re studying _UNK_
to the new business model of neuroscience ,
But we &apos;d like to share with people around the world
so that people can go further and try to cure all kinds of diseases
We hope that through understanding the neural network of the brain
By some degree of surgery , we can repair and design nerves
We will continue to study some of the diseases I &apos;ve told you about before .
_UNK_ : You have some profound _UNK_ in your speech .
And the second step is that I hear ,
is the brain of two colors to control the brain .
_UNK_ : This makes every nerve impulse in the brain into binary code .
When the blue light _UNK_ , we can transmit information . It &apos;s like a code .
and then the light is closed , and it &apos;s like the type of code .
Our hope is to build a brain _UNK_ processor
to help the people who have disabled
you can _UNK_ it into a string of 0 and one .
_UNK_ : It &apos;s true . We want to test it through this
to understand more about the brain in this way .
_UNK_ : This is not meant that you can download memory .
_UNK_ : Some of the work we &apos;re working on is very complicated .
And we &apos;re trying to tag the brain record ,
we can record information and transmit information to the brain --
_UNK_ : Well , this will change my world . Thank you !
90 percent of the time in the life
_UNK_ &apos;s naked eye can &apos;t see the life form :
We spent a lot of time in the room
And then we looked at three different rooms
We were allowed to close the mechanical ventilation in the room .
If you look at the diagram of the graph ,
what you find is that we usually want to do --
If you look at the green _UNK_ ,
You can see that the vast diversity of microbes
But if you look at the blue blue _UNK_ ,
And if we look at the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And you can actually discover from this icon
If you look at the blue blue blue _UNK_ ,
They &apos;re not just green _UNK_ that represent outdoor air _UNK_ .
They &apos;re often connected to the leaves and dust .
Maybe it &apos;s not necessarily the most useful alternative to our health .
And these are all the things that we call
So , for this reason , a lot of people will eat _UNK_ .
I want you to see where I live ,
and a photograph of the place in that place
The huge smoke _UNK_ to the west , and _UNK_ away from my place .
And we had a baby for two and a half days . This is our children ,
I had to deal with these two different things ,
And there was a 9 / 11 near me ,
And when I went out of my apartment ,
or out of the streets in front of the apartment ,
My first thought was that after all , I just proposed a bad _UNK_ in the new book .
because it took a lot of ink to praise the population .
and the innovation potential , accurately , is the density of urban population .
_UNK_ it to people and put it in the same place .
or the same street that makes people exchange information .
When you look at the World Trade Center and _UNK_ ,
And one of the lessons that I learned is that
And if it had been developed by the technology
It may be able to get the most _UNK_ technology
is to build two buildings that can hold 50,000 people
you compare the number of deaths in the Pentagon and World Trade ,
And so I started thinking about high density
whether it &apos;s a right proposal . I &apos;m not sure .
I &apos;ve been in this meditation for many days .
A few days later , the wind started changing ,
It still feels that the air is not so clean .
And even in the _UNK_ street there was no half cars ,
My wife was going to let me go .
_UNK_ _UNK_ ; _UNK_ bought a bigger air filter .
It was obvious that people like me were _UNK_ ,
There is no worry about the ghost walking 20 blocks .
I found out that the great thing was going out ,
I was going to buy the air on my way .
and found that all the streets were very popular .
It was amazing . It was a great day
_UNK_ had never been so dynamic in the _UNK_ .
Jane , Aunt Harriet , wrote her book in the _UNK_ of the American big city , _UNK_ , an early friend of Jane , _UNK_ , _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the city &apos;s plan .
The book also has a big impact on my book ,
_UNK_ , who was in this old _UNK_ bar ,
A lot of children play in the _UNK_ paradise
And all of you include the residents here
all the restaurants and bars are in business .
There is no car through the block , from a certain aspect , even better .
The other amazing thing is that cities are still running normal .
all the things that make a city become successful ,
all of the things that make a city move ,
are all showing up on the streets of the street .
I think this is the power of the city .
When we talk about cities , we all think they &apos;re _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
But a lot of times it was so powerful
There is no city that allows you to take away your _UNK_ center .
If it &apos;s true , it might be the World Trade Center .
I mean , the emergency _UNK_ was there ,
and the life of the building and the life .
But two _UNK_ , in the north of it ,
If you go into the heart of people ,
There is still no shortage of _UNK_ in many minds .
Many _UNK_ are still out of the _UNK_ .
and people need to have a long time back .
but the system of the city is growing .
I want to talk a little bit about how this system works .
and how do we use these principles ,
to get the Internet to the point today .
And I found myself asking people to ask questions ,
And when I talk about this &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot;
the best way to get people to understand
that makes the _UNK_ look like that ?
But the answer is that every person and nobody
And again , if you ask , after September 9 , who let me live in the community
And we &apos;re going to focus on the Internet ,
These interesting things and phenomena don &apos;t have any _UNK_ .
So this is an amazing age of _UNK_ ,
I just want to talk about some of these things .
I believe that in the network there &apos;s a kind of
This is not the king of the future , although it looks like
It &apos;s just a man , I found it on a _UNK_ network .
And you see , he &apos;s interested in football and Jesus .
and _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , and my family website .
This is something that &apos;s really exciting and really interactive .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s more likely to be _UNK_ to that era .
because suddenly you have the ability to take your pictures
on the Internet , and if other people are online ,
There is power to click or click on this link .
I don &apos;t want to look at it . In some sense ,
If you quote Jeff yesterday , you know ,
This is basically a kind of electronic interface .
It &apos;s a great increase in people &apos;s interest in the Internet .
You put a link , and someone else can click it .
You can go to any website you want to want .
But this is still a _UNK_ relationship .
There &apos;s a link that other people are on the other side .
and decided to click it or not click it .
And we &apos;ve seen a couple of examples
When you search for Steve Jobs , Johnson will do that .
Two months ago , I had a huge breakthrough
I think this is one of my biggest achievements .
My personal website finally ended up looking for the first .
And here &apos;s a guy named Steve Johnson , who &apos;s a _UNK_ ,
He _UNK_ two . I &apos;m happy to be happy .
and I &apos;ll do something like this later .
_UNK_ , Google is absolutely the best technology to use .
but you &apos;ll see a lot of other people at the same time .
to create this search page , although we all know how to do it .
It &apos;s not personal . He &apos;s not going to decide to make me happen in Steve _UNK_ .
I _UNK_ my website , the Internet decided to click or click .
Google is just at home with a number of figures .
And the Internet has _UNK_ this page ,
to take the &quot; _UNK_ &quot; out of the book .
Now , they &apos;re more creative , and of course Google has been very _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a very interesting website -- called _UNK_ _UNK_ .
with all kinds of network application and gradually expanding them .
And it &apos;s focused on the entire blogosphere .
And the simple thing is to analyze all the blogs
and track how many other blogs are tracking before .
So I came up with a call authority _UNK_ ,
a blog that has been linked to many other blogs
than a blog that was connected to a few times .
So at any time , any page on the page ,
If you want to know how to look at this page .
Here you see how the blogosphere looks at my website -- this is based on _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ by _UNK_ .
I &apos;m talking about the limitations of _UNK_ links
but they don &apos;t know how to connect you .
And this is what the Internet is for .
because only the connections and the interaction mechanism
And here &apos;s a _UNK_ from David _UNK_ ,
He thought that all the things on the Internet
And he said , if there &apos;s a link here ,
You see that link because another person decided to put it here ,
A link on a page will not be as _UNK_ in another page .
But I don &apos;t think this theory is exactly right .
If you look at the right side of my _UNK_ ,
It will change the environment of the Internet .
I can &apos;t control it directly in my will .
In a way , this is more like a _UNK_ fungi .
on my website , rather than one of my links
It &apos;s basically a global brain . It &apos;s a brain . Everybody &apos;s a cell theory .
You can do lots of different experiments , see what the brain is thinking about .
to look at what &apos;s happening and what people like ,
And finally , we &apos;re going to make some interesting data images .
And I &apos;ve been doing this for Google ,
But now I &apos;m going to give a little bit of criticism
is that it gets information that people are looking for ,
The picture of the door , but it &apos;s not a new _UNK_ .
When the _UNK_ flew killed , there was a lot of _UNK_ search
And of course , we can predict it .
And these new tools are going to be
They can detect the depth of the _UNK_
_UNK_ can also be released in blood circulation systems to track and analyze the trend .
But the key is that we can &apos;t find something new from it ?
I &apos;ve tried a new thing called _UNK_ .
and then take this word and someone &apos;s name and search for it .
So the word search pages for this word
and the percentage of the number of people &apos;s name pages .
We have 6 % of our good friends , but I may add a decimal point .
_UNK_ , if you expand the search for a little bit ,
to find out that _UNK_ had a _UNK_ .
And this is me , because I &apos;m going to put it in a _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t want to play with the next group ,
But I did an evolutionary and natural selection in Google
You can see , because this is a big category , so only a small percentage .
Dan _UNK_ took over _UNK_ &apos;s philosophy , and he would say a few minutes .
And so the _UNK_ lead a little bit .
If you expand the result of the search ,
And in fact , you see some interesting search results
like Gary _UNK_ , the percentage of the _UNK_ relations with the Christian .
And of course , he had different ideas about evolution and nature .
And here he is _UNK_ _UNK_ , and so on .
We seem to be in the _UNK_ track ,
So many words , Chris , this is a very good group of speakers .
And the other thing is that it &apos;s a bit different
You may have seen the report of this report .
The popular word about the American state report in the country .
And they didn &apos;t know where it came from .
It looks like a random display of information .
but there was no _UNK_ in the history of history .
The first group , this is a popular word .
This is the age of _UNK_ _UNK_ , the popular word .
I didn &apos;t know what new thing was , because it was so obvious .
In 1985 , the Reagan was in the 1970s ,
in a way to read them in a way .
is &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; depressed &quot; and _UNK_ &quot; have a lot of _UNK_ .
It can download storage , but it &apos;s hard to remember them .
And of course , it &apos;s hard to see
is the political language that _UNK_ the country .
to transition to more _UNK_ , more simple , more _UNK_ ,
20 years ago , you &apos;d like to _UNK_ &apos; to ask your country what you did .
But Reagan likes to use &apos; , &apos; That &apos;s &quot; , &quot; Here Nancy and I , &quot;
But you will not notice that he is using that .
Now the question is , this is a very interesting question :
How do you get a more advanced form
in the entire network ecosystem , especially in the _UNK_ ecosystems ,
because they seem to be in the middle
I think it &apos;s going to happen in blogs , and it &apos;s going to happen in the outside system .
_UNK_ wrote an interesting article in the future .
There &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ in the last month ,
to connect to different blogs that are different .
It &apos;s also followed by the laws of _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) and 80 law .
And most of the blogs are just connected .
So 20 percent of the blogs have 80 percent links
because the Internet is the ultimate form of modern democracy ,
Everybody can make his voice and hear the world .
So , not only do we ask , &quot; Why is this going to happen ? &quot;
but it &apos;s a kind of _UNK_ phenomenon in today .
Now , the great phenomenon is that people continue to contribute .
After a few seconds in the paper , people started to change
The potential rules of the system , so a different shape starts .
It is based on the principle of the strike .
If you &apos;re the first site , everyone will link to you .
If you are the second , most people will link to you .
You can build a lot of links in the _UNK_ time ,
and it &apos;s likely to be connected to your website .
In _UNK_ , the founder of _UNK_ started doing this .
is that after the article in _UNK_ ,
to give the link priority to the _UNK_ .
He began to look at some of the _UNK_
And then these _UNK_ are available in 24 hours .
So , in a sense , the popular blog comes from the _UNK_ .
So he actually developed a tool to change the entire system .
But you change the game rules from interesting ways .
So the _UNK_ thing is that my speech will be over here .
But there are no specific components and _UNK_ to the type of _UNK_ link .
and based on the pattern to change their behavior .
So the most _UNK_ thing about this debate
If the veil and software can change it ,
And for those of you who do this ,
And so , &quot; Maybe there &apos;s no birds &apos; problem ,
to look around the _UNK_ of North American _UNK_ .
and it turns out to be the _UNK_ .
I &apos;m not a scientist , it &apos;s a very clear idea .
But we just talked about what the bird might be .
In my world , this is a plastic duck .
&quot; This product contains the U.S. government that sees
that causes cancer , _UNK_ , or other family injury . &quot;
how culture is going to make this product ,
If you have a mark , then sell to children ?
I was listening to six hours of public radio in the country .
&quot; _UNK_ the conversation , and send me this word , thank you .
&quot; We realize that design is the _UNK_ signal ,
And it had to happen in the world ,
We have to understand the world , the world ,
So when we look at what we &apos;re designing
the basic state of things , we have to go back to the original condition .
to understand the running system and the architecture of the planet ,
I think there &apos;s an exciting part , which is good news ,
And I think that since our culture is so _UNK_ ,
We can add this rich object , it &apos;s a stable ,
I put it under the bottom of the _UNK_ ,
So , what we &apos;re trying to do , what we &apos;re going to do --
If we wake up in the morning , we designed this world --
What is our goal as a species ?
because how do you lead to what you killed ?
because you can &apos;t do anything , if you can &apos;t lead it .
So the question is , what is the first question of designers ?
Now , as a _UNK_ -- for example ,
It has the right to kill and _UNK_ --
Now the question that we asked _UNK_ is ,
But I don &apos;t know that this is a common argument .
We are hard to keep the perpetual operation of the enterprise .
So , we basically use commercial tools to work ,
How do we care about all species and generations ?
So we &apos;re starting to design this problem .
because what we know today is the modern culture
And if we go to this point , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t have a chance
and said , &quot; That &apos;s not my plan , &quot;
And we know , in fact , that &apos;s what we do .
because we lack other steps to lead to these things .
President Bush asked me to go to the White House
I pointed out that they don &apos;t seem to have a plan .
If it &apos;s to be global warming , they do a good job .
If it &apos;s the end of the fire power power system ,
because they were _UNK_ the _UNK_ Act ,
So I think our educational plan should be _UNK_ :
&quot; All children are _UNK_ , and one cannot stay . &quot;
Be ready to move your family to Ohio and Pennsylvania ?
So if you don &apos;t have the pleasure of people ,
So maybe we can come up with a strategy to change ,
It needs to be modest . In my architect ,
_UNK_ , &quot; modest &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; these two words ,
No longer appeared in the same text after a book of _UNK_ .
And if anyone here has a _UNK_ idea of this designer ,
Listen to this saying : we took the flowers
So , what Kevin Kelly said , did not end up .
is a _UNK_ , and we are in this _UNK_ _UNK_ .
This is what I &apos;m talking about in the White House .
Our goal is a world of happiness , security , health and justice ,
there &apos;s a _UNK_ air , a _UNK_ water , soil and electricity --
Even if you don &apos;t remember the name of _UNK_ ,
&quot; What happened when the French President of the French president said .
He said , &quot; How do you think there &apos;s 400 kinds of Cheese ? &quot;
But at the same time , we know our product is not safe and healthy .
We analyzed the composition of the chemical composition .
This is the _UNK_ of _UNK_ , which gives you your children
When did her uniform be _UNK_ by the white ?
The UN has already announced that _UNK_ has the same human rights .
The clean air is obvious to everyone needs to breathe .
_UNK_ soil is a key problem -- soil _UNK_ ,
In North America , _UNK_ defeated the rule of _UNK_ fuel ,
So the traders _UNK_ out of the market .
If we remember when _UNK_ was a member of the oil organization ,
Did anybody ask him , when is oil going to end ?
I don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , he said ,
? The Stone Age wasn &apos;t because we were finished with stones ?
We see the world &apos;s behavior as a moral company .
We see the future of the material stream .
This is the monitor from Los Angeles to China .
to give four pounds of toxic _UNK_ to her children ,
In other ways , we see the signs of hope .
He was free to _UNK_ his eyes for free .
From the material stream we found that steel couldn &apos;t be a car ,
The upper floor is a nylon , which can be recycled for my own ,
If I &apos;m a bird , the building on the left is dangerous .
On the right hand , we built a business park for _UNK_ ,
There will be pristine _UNK_ on the roof , and it will be a _UNK_ place .
This is my hometown . I grew up in Hong Kong :
In _UNK_ , there are four hours of water per day .
And the relationship between the land is this :
The farmer _UNK_ the _UNK_ in the same block .
You can &apos;t grow up to the same land .
I spent my childhood in Washington in _UNK_ ,
My grandfather had been the Olympic _UNK_ ,
So I had a lot of trees and was trying to get rid of it .
And in this building , you know , you know ,
It may work for Berlin , but we _UNK_ it to Houston ,
The windows were full . And the majority of the products
And it &apos;s not designed for the interior ,
I was in _UNK_ , the first energy crisis ,
I designed the first solar heating house in Ireland ,
It makes you feel my ambition in the world .
Richard _UNK_ was one of my teachers ,
I was often criticized by my _UNK_ ,
And he would say , &quot; Bill , you know --
In 1984 , we designed the first American _UNK_ ,
We began to ask the components of their materials .
The only indoor quality of the country at that time
The purpose of study is to prove that
So suddenly , I graduated from high school ,
The thing happened , we know &quot; _UNK_ &quot; is out of us .
Remember that we used to abandon the goods , why are we going to abandon ?
And the U.S. _UNK_ and the atmosphere shows , like this --
They found six _UNK_ on the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
They were asked to say , &quot; It &apos;s like a _UNK_ tank . &quot;
So we &apos;re looking for the rules of design --
This is the most diversity in the world , _UNK_ ,
The book is made of a polymer . It is _UNK_ trees .
The first chapter is called &quot; This book is not a tree . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ve written the history in _UNK_
So many polymer , what we really need is the technology nutrient ,
Think about this kind of exercise problem :
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , store solar energy for fuel ,
Now , let &apos;s chop it and write it ?
It &apos;s the same thing -- as I can &apos;t get it ?
We add _UNK_ goals because I came from Charlotte ,
And I had the fortune of Thomas _UNK_ &apos;s house .
We add life , freedom and pursuit of happiness .
Do you know , most people don &apos;t know it &apos;s coming from .
is the way the Olympic athletes train each other .
So we &apos;ve been looking at the concept of competition ,
a concept that moves forward and forward to work .
is not the way we use our modern competition .
to destroy each other or put it down ,
because in our dictionary , the asphalt is _UNK_ .
But if we look at the asphalt as we grow ,
And we realized that what we did was _UNK_
So , when we look at E as a poet ,
And all of a sudden , you get biology .
We have energy , so we can solve problems ,
But the problem of biology is subtle because when we deal with
the premise that life is growing up --
and it _UNK_ the open system of a chemical substance .
So , we &apos;re going to turn artificial objects into life ,
We &apos;re going to grow , we &apos;re going to get free from the Sun .
And then , &quot; _UNK_ or &quot; is not a problem ,
We &apos;re going to make things that we can enjoy ,
One day the food drugs will allow us to do French cheese .
I worked with a German chemist in _UNK_ ,
And there &apos;s a system of technology metabolism ,
Technology nutrient will be ten times the amount of _UNK_ .
And that &apos;s what if we all _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
the world would be exhausted because of the _UNK_ .
But we &apos;re going to try to analyze these materials .
and heavy metals and how we make them .
Our products are _UNK_ , and we analyzed the textile industry .
We &apos;ve done 4,000 of the most common chemicals in human production ,
will be open to the database within six weeks .
The designers in the world will analyze their products ,
to take care of human and human health .
We &apos;ve developed a set of homework rules that allow companies to send
And these messages are _UNK_ around the supply chain ,
because when we did most of our companies -- about _UNK_ dollars .
-- &quot; Where are your material coming from ? &quot; They said , &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
The water is so quiet that it can drink .
Technology nutrient - _UNK_ companies can be _UNK_ with _UNK_ _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ for the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ technology -- Ford &apos;s _UNK_ of _UNK_ --
Nike shoe is the top of the polyester , _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ your old shoe to come back with new shoes .
The idea of car here is that there are some materials
go back to the industry , some materials go back into the soil --
It produces more energy than building and _UNK_ water demand .
This is a building for the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
This is the project we did for Ford _UNK_ ,
This is a _UNK_ plan for the _UNK_ River .
These are our tools . This is how we sell Ford .
And we did this for Ford to save _UNK_ dollars ,
In _UNK_ profits , the value of $ _UNK_ billion is _UNK_ .
That &apos;s this . It &apos;s the largest green roof in the world , _UNK_ .
These two _UNK_ _UNK_ are the species that settle here .
The country -- the _UNK_ _UNK_ . They &apos;re _UNK_ together .
And I &apos;m going to show you that we &apos;re working on the Chinese government
Our job is to develop the rules of homework ,
We did a lot of energy balance -- if they were _UNK_ ,
They will lose all dirt and _UNK_ all coal .
They don &apos;t have any energy in their cities .
Because if they poison themselves , as the _UNK_ maker ,
it sends it to the lowest cost of distribution systems --
And then we pay them all , and what we found is that
I was still at the age of my students
Now we &apos;re using molecules . These are cities that we &apos;re going to plan .
We &apos;re going to build a new city next to this city ; look at landscape .
We usually build on the green floor , but this is about to break up ,
It seems to be a rubber _UNK_ on the scene .
And then they asked us to say , &quot; How do you do that ? &quot;
This is what they might get , and this is a color picture .
This is the current base , which is what it looks like ,
We studied the wind and the sun , so that everyone in town
the fresh air , clean water , and the flat flat
There will be a direct sunshine in the daytime .
And then we set up the park to build them .
So people have the center and the square _UNK_ .
We have 24 hours of streets , so we always have activity .
If you go in the toilet , the _UNK_ will go into the waste water ,
because who is going to make natural gas ?
The water is all built as a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And then it produces natural gas , and then goes back to town .
as a cooking for cooking to use fuel .
And these are the _UNK_ that are _UNK_ .
to the roof of the city , where it can be farming ,
because we got up the city and the city
in the air -- and then _UNK_ the original ,
The solar panels can supply the power of the city .
This is the idea of the top of the city .
The _UNK_ is able to _UNK_ in the roof and back .
We put the job on the ground floor .
This is the current city , and this is the new city .
Now , like the map of our reality
Most people , when they first saw new human brains ,
And they would say , &quot; It looks like a normal thing
Generally , the brain you saw was a fixed brain . It was gray .
you have 20 percent of the blood in your heart .
Scientists are at the end of the 20th century
and make a map of what &apos;s happening in the human brain .
For example , they can see the part of the brain behind ,
Here is the old man , and it allows you to remain right .
It makes me stand here . It &apos;s a part of a _UNK_ activity .
What we hear here is the primary processing ,
You are sending it to more advanced language processing centers .
is to create all the complex ideas that make decisions ,
This is where all the decision processes are being done .
You may not have a little _UNK_ as a dinner .
So if you look deeper into the brain ,
And part of it , if you look at it ,
You can &apos;t really see the whole thing , most of the brain structure .
Some scientists have invented a _UNK_ that can be dyed cells .
And this is the color of the _UNK_ .
You can see it &apos;s a very distributed , you can see a lot of structures .
But you can see what &apos;s going on under that .
is where all the _UNK_ line goes through .
We have about a neuron in our brain .
And as you can see , they &apos;re not all distributed .
We can start to map the brain function now .
We can begin to _UNK_ these functions into every independent cell .
And as I mentioned , there are neurons here .
And there are some small cells you see right now .
with the other 10,000 neurons in your brain .
The protein controls the same thing as a ion channel .
They control the part of the cells in the nervous system .
It &apos;s basically about everything in the nervous system .
So , when we go deeper and deeper and look at it ,
and understand what &apos;s going on in this gene .
It was a place where a dead man was taken .
We choose the brain based on a lot of reference data .
We get the brain 20 to 60 normal people ,
because we &apos;re trying to measure things -- RNA _UNK_ .
So we actually get more male brain than women .
Men are more likely to die in their lifetime .
The first thing we did in the collecting site
It &apos;s a standard _UNK_ that we can _UNK_ other data through it .
You can use this as a map of our map .
is to collect something called _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and make our _UNK_ map of the highway .
We put it in a basic form of meat _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a blade that can be made
we &apos;re going to be able to paint it .
And then we get the first map of it .
If you want to think about the border of the state ,
From this point we can take the brain into pieces .
It can be placed on a smaller low temperature .
This is 20 _UNK_ thickness , about the hair of the baby .
that it will be used to paint the _UNK_ .
Our _UNK_ is going to enter and understand them more .
This is what they see in the microscope .
This is a program that they know where to do it .
and they can basically be involved in the collection .
to go back to another piece of brain ,
You can see the cutting _UNK_ , and then the brain breaks off .
And then we put a _UNK_ tag on it .
And then we put it on something called a _UNK_ array chip .
Now what you think is that you see is a swarm of dot ,
is a piece of the glass that we have .
When we get a sample and we get it to the glass line ,
If you would like to open a lot of genes in that case .
We can get a thousand samples from a brain .
The area here shows is the brain _UNK_ .
And every sample gives us a _UNK_ of _UNK_
I &apos;m going to show you what this looks like .
Every scientist in the world can get free data .
They don &apos;t even have to go to this tool ,
_UNK_ these data , and finding more interesting things from it .
You start to understand these things from the data we &apos;ve collected before .
There &apos;s a _UNK_ on the left that allows you to pull up .
It &apos;s where we usually understand the _UNK_ of genes .
is the gene opens to a good level .
Green is a little bit _UNK_ , it &apos;s not launched .
Remember that we &apos;ve done all the genes in the genome ,
We &apos;re just starting to look at these data .
There are some basic things you want to know .
If you want to understand the action of drug ,
You want to understand how they &apos;re going to act with you .
and don &apos;t want them to run their way .
You want to understand where the genes can open .
And the first time we can do it .
We can do the individuals we can also test it .
We really confirm that the genes are going to be
These things contain _UNK_ structures , which are already known to be useful .
But we haven &apos;t seen the whole thing yet .
We had the opportunity to see some of the places that never had seen before ,
And this is a very interesting side effect .
And the other thing you can do is ,
because it &apos;s a match model that is connected ,
And the whole genome list of the genome
the form of what people normally see in news :
Scientists have recently discovered that the X chromosome
They tried to figure out how to do
But what you get from these experiments is that
It can tell you what it is , but you don &apos;t know where you know .
and get the clue of what &apos;s going on .
They can start thinking about the usual way --
And other ways they didn &apos;t do that before .
is that although we are lucky to all of us ,
And this is an example of a study
We track and study what these different things are .
What we found is that genes are represented by independent cells .
We found two genes as a good example .
A _UNK_ - It is contained in a early development clues .
and told us there was a gene that was opened .
So I &apos;m going to show you the last note
But we &apos;re just studying a few individuals now .
And you can see that I &apos;m very _UNK_ .
And you &apos;ll see this in a moment .
I think many of you probably may be
Imagine that you &apos;ve raised millions of dollars
You have a budget that you want to spend money on poverty .
And what they think is that we spend the money
or to believe that there are other people :
They think aid is used , but there &apos;s a harm .
After all , we spent billions of dollars on aid
And the reason is -- take Africa as an example
And the GDP of Africa is going to grow
We don &apos;t know how this hypothesis would be .
to aid and pray that it will take some benefit .
And sometimes the patient had to cure the death of the patient
It took a lot of money in the world
are going to spend a lot of money on immunity .
and the developing world has done a lot of work .
This is what &apos;s called the last mile _UNK_ .
In fact , malaria is the biggest cause of five year-old children .
In addition , not only one of the people in the net
If half of the people in the community sleep in the net ,
However , only a quarter of the kids who are _UNK_ on the net
Or on this issue , subsidies to people who use nets
or at least they don &apos;t use the nets ,
is free nets to get the biggest net coverage ?
to get them to the value of the nets ?
Maybe that &apos;s the solution that maybe we should send kids to school .
Would you hire more teachers ? Do you build more school buildings ?
In this way , you can predict the components
I &apos;m going to give you some examples of these three problems .
Now , it &apos;s not because there &apos;s no vaccine there ,
and not because parents don &apos;t care about children .
a child who has no immune to _UNK_
And the problem is that people don &apos;t know too much .
You have to do a few kilometers to get kids to immunity .
Maybe you find out when you get to the immune site ,
You have to go back to your home ,
If you have a lot of things to do ,
If this is a problem , it &apos;s a lot of simple
It &apos;s a very simple idea but we don &apos;t know it .
We used to be random and controlled experiments .
It &apos;s a very easy way to tell you that .
by giving them a _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
to do what they don &apos;t want to do .
On the other hand , if your problem is that you &apos;re always _UNK_ ,
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to act on today .
and then the number of _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
It &apos;s just a little bit of a _UNK_ .
Now you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , _UNK_ is not sustainable .
Since you are always paying a nurse ,
and ultimately , it &apos;s cheaper than not to give it .
Are you free money or allowing people to pay ?
The first question is that if people have to pay nets ,
Because if we think that people are accustomed to charity ,
will _UNK_ the market for free nets ,
a lot of experiments have the same outcome .
And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
you can buy nets in a local point ,
And when people had to pay a net ,
Three dollars is still not a net net cost .
Now you only have 20 percent of you have nets ,
The good news is that when people have nets ,
and they would use the net net nets ,
They get free of the net , they use it .
They &apos;re paid for the net , and they &apos;re going to use it .
is actually more likely to buy the second net ,
So people don &apos;t have to be used to charity .
Maybe we should be more confident about them
Those are the things that you think about nets ,
You know how to _UNK_ you know how to give nets . &quot;
But what _UNK_ needs is a group of choices
They need to know : in all of these things I can do ,
Which is the best way to achieve the goal ?
If your goal is to get kids to school ,
There are so many things that you can pay for _UNK_ .
So are these enough ? For instance , if we think that these things should be effective ,
It &apos;s obviously not what we do in business .
with the same _UNK_ and the same horse .
Is it possible to ship the goods on the road ?
So why don &apos;t we make social policy in the same way ?
Why don &apos;t we make social policy in the same way ?
The first answer is some common assumption :
you can get an extra education in three years .
It &apos;s not a good thing to _UNK_ parents .
just because a lot of children are starting to school ,
you end up spending a lot of money
You spend a hundred dollars on this thing .
This is not what people want to do .
We need more information than that we need .
OK , I &apos;m starting with that big question . I can &apos;t answer it .
And I can answer these little questions ,
And we &apos;re going to talk about _UNK_ ,
You don &apos;t think about it as much as it sounds .
But if we want to die less than five years old ,
I think part of the problem is that
They would send them to the past
But the problem of poverty is not that .
And finally we don &apos;t know whether we &apos;re going to do the right thing .
I &apos;m going to give you three simple answers .
You can save a life with 300 dollars .
This is an example of how powerful it is .
_UNK_ doesn &apos;t cause the headlines of the news .
But when the young global leaders are in _UNK_ ,
and a lot of the governments and foundations
Now maybe we can go back to that .
the last aid that took place in the past
But we can go back here in 30 years .
I believe we can do that , and I hope we can do it .
Welcome to Africa , or I _UNK_ , welcome home .
isn &apos;t it ? This is our _UNK_ here .
from hundreds of millions of years ago ,
We know that the human race is all over here .
And four days later , we &apos;ll have an exciting journey
You &apos;re going to hear from other speakers in Africa .
But I want to bring the order right now ,
Let these stories go back again . We &apos;ll get some things on the stage and eliminate each other .
OK , I &apos;m going to ask you : What &apos;s the worst case in Africa ?
But about Africa , the stories we haven &apos;t heard before .
And the real story of the positive meaning
and I &apos;m going to talk about the content
and remove the _UNK_ , the components that are _UNK_ .
to get the statistics of the real world .
to get the facts that are happening around us .
to make Africa a chance for you to choose
This change depends on how we can understand
how do you get to the opportunity
is the important field in my career ,
to help these businesses become more than Africa .
is when I did an MBA program in the United States ,
The lead character of the school also is my teacher .
And she said , &quot; _UNK_ , I want to write a case --
My first thought of Nelson Mandela . ( South Africa )
a country that has been in the _UNK_
but he started to lead the country to a benign cycle
has become a chapter of the _UNK_ new book .
Why did I tell you this story ? Because after that , I went to the interview ,
_UNK_ is a radio company , and they asked me
&quot; What do you learn in this ? Or what do you prefer ? &quot;
It &apos;s a great honor to write a project like this .
what I learned from Africa , a African story .
and then we share it with the world .
what the _UNK_ in the transition of the company
I want to share with you my personal story .
In 1994 , I picked up my bags ,
But soon I was a guy in southern Africa --
South Africa -- to the _UNK_ of Africa , Egypt ,
The first person came to a tin _UNK_ -- one of my _UNK_
There are many factors in the tin _UNK_ ,
But the key place here is that
to look for his _UNK_ here in this room .
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ across the desert
half of the military was _UNK_ in dust .
In the mythology , the Alexander had the _UNK_
And so Africa is a place to find answers
is that it &apos;s fascinating to the sky .
There &apos;s no light source , _UNK_ is a fascinating place .
As soon as you look up at the sky , the sky is usually painted ,
I saw a similar view , but that was the landscape .
And the picture was really _UNK_ me .
so that I can &apos;t forget . And that moment , remember ,
and share with you what I see in that moment .
The first picture is the night of North American _UNK_ --
and it &apos;s covered with a warm light .
And I see Africa . _UNK_ continental &quot; _UNK_ &quot; --
It gives you a sense of what it means .
and the challenges that we are facing
because Africa may be dark -- relative to
It &apos;s located in the north , south or south --
&quot; We think Africa &apos;s only black , the source is our ignorance . &quot;
and let &apos;s start to light the land .
Africa is the second largest continent in the world .
In fact , from the continent -- Africa is so _UNK_
and you can take the United States ,
China , and the whole European _UNK_ here , still has space .
You might say , &quot; Investment is more than 1,000 languages in Africa ,
As a banker , I &apos;m always in all sorts of _UNK_ information
in the _UNK_ of the capital market ,
I &apos;d like to share with you the _UNK_ , or the signal ,
and you can say that the wind of change
and it &apos;s going to be a big factor
In general , the whole African inflation is falling .
_UNK_ : In 2006 , inflation was _UNK_ by _UNK_
Egypt : It was reduced by _UNK_ to _UNK_
from 16 to eight to eight percent
And more interesting , other countries like South Africa ,
It &apos;s just part of the story . It &apos;s kind of currency --
At the same time , Africa is not a country .
So you can be sure -- &quot; Investment Africa &quot; is not appropriate .
You can make money in Africa , and you may lose money .
The _UNK_ of North American American Chamber of Commerce .
I am honored to be able to be elected .
because it &apos;s a role to attract people .
And I said that these words just wanted to promote
is to think that the company in Africa
The first thing we &apos;re going to talk about South Africa
but not about the South Africa that we often talk about --
those gold , minerals and infrastructure to build
For example , South Africa is now selected for 1000 British companies
The best call _UNK_ is the center of the call .
_UNK_ capital and _UNK_ to South Africa in the private sector .
The headlines of South Africa are : &quot; _UNK_ ! &quot;
But what are they going to do ? In order to get the assets
to get the stock of _UNK_ , _UNK_ is a big retail company .
And the truth shows that they open their business process .
And as a retail , it was convinced that
the number of middle classes will continue to increase
and believe that the consumer &apos;s confidence will increase
But in Africa , I focused on the field . Not far north Africa ,
the challenge -- and we &apos;ll hear more about Nigeria .
But look at Goldman &apos;s job -- we have the famous reports of _UNK_ .
The latest report , &quot; _UNK_ , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on
Nigeria will become the economy in the world 10 years ago .
What &apos;s happening in Nigeria ? A lot of .
I want to talk about this in the capital market .
The trust bank recently issued the first European bond
The first European bond has led the international capital
This is a sign of an economic field .
And then look at the oil industry , Africa provides _UNK_
in the United States , and the Middle East is just _UNK_ .
the oil that goes from _UNK_ to _UNK_ every day .
is the same thing as the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
But in Africa , we &apos;re starting to deal with this .
We had to leave the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
because it &apos;s _UNK_ oil , it &apos;s going to sell
And I &apos;m also _UNK_ out of this field .
Egypt is a big industrial area that &apos;s moving forward .
The news that we &apos;ve just announced last week
And they wanted to be a industrial power .
to get an organic product standard . Because you can sell better price .
Again , the opportunity is to meet the market needs
_UNK_ and develop their forests . Why do you do that ?
to meet the needs of energy and electricity
from 80 banks to 25 , although it has consolidated the system .
But what &apos;s going to happen ? The country &apos;s only 10 percent banks .
There &apos;s only 700 ATM in the country . There &apos;s an opportunity !
We &apos;re going to look at the continent of Africa .
People see the street , like , would say ,
&quot; _UNK_ : 90 percent of the roads don &apos;t have asphalt , oh ! &quot;
The price will be _UNK_ in the transportation of the goods .
Nigeria : 70 percent of the roads don &apos;t have asphalt . _UNK_ : 80 percent .
Most cases , there is no asphalt over 50 percent of the road .
This is a chance ! The energy needs -- a chance
So what is the signal in the fundamental transformation ?
If I ask you , &quot; In 2005 , the best stock market in the world
Or where is the market ? &quot; Can you think of Egypt ?
In 2005 , the Egypt market -- the Stock Exchange --
and the same time in other countries ?
We &apos;ll look at 2006 . Kenya , more than 60 percent . Nigeria : 40 percent .
In any investment decision , there is a key problem
Because Africa today , we compete with global capital markets .
and the global capital doesn &apos;t know -- because he doesn &apos;t have any _UNK_
The United States is a surplus of capital , and the problem is on the yield rate .
in order to increase the rate of investors
to realize what he was doing or what she was doing .
Two B in _UNK_ and Turkey -- we &apos;ll soon have two contrast .
and people point out , South Africa : three B - _UNK_ : A +
In fact , one of the largest _UNK_ companies in Africa
Why do they do that ? Because they want to follow their investment .
which is the last thing I want to talk about ,
has started the first African channel . Why do _UNK_ do that ?
And the reason they &apos;re looking forward to the big events
And I have you , the people who are going to invest
and people around the world are going to invest
And this is the change of the beginning .
And finally , I want to just look at it ,
and the things that I &apos;m really interested in
This time you see the complete picture I saw in 2002 .
and ask you to think about what &apos;s going on in Africa .
thinking about whether your journey will bring light to this continent .
In _UNK_ , _UNK_ published a book of darkness ,
a _UNK_ hero in the _UNK_ River .
and it &apos;s light . This is the real _UNK_ River .
to the next stage , in the next four days ,
Maybe if you can save this picture in your brain ,
and we &apos;ll be able to meet the future in 2020 .
For me , the brain magic is a magic trick .
unlike traditional magic , it &apos;s the power of the _UNK_ ,
and a wide range of technology creates a sixth illusion .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you that once you know how to do that ,
There are many simple ways to control human minds .
All the audience in the audience joined me and came to me .
First of all , I hope that all of you will _UNK_ up .
About half of the audience raised his left hand . Why ?
OK , cross your hand , right hand , right hand .
OK , now , cross your hands , so your right hand
Then , make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb .
You have a _UNK_ , and you &apos;ll go back .
It &apos;s great . It &apos;s like I &apos;m going to stretch your fingers .
OK , now , if you don &apos;t allow me to cheat your head ,
So , now you can look at me ,
Once you know , how simple it is to control people .
There &apos;s a story of a 75 - year - old lady ,
Now there &apos;s someone still trying to do this --
-- the woman can feel printing and even color through touch .
And she could be able to do it in a _UNK_
It &apos;s hard to use a finger to read a serial bill .
I was at the time , but at the same time I was _UNK_ .
And some people did a demonstration yesterday ,
In a room where everybody close his eyes , they can only hear the sound .
to try and understand what this is strange .
And earlier , I was going to play the television show ,
Keith : _UNK_ , I &apos;m Keith , I &apos;m going to take you to a secret place ?
_UNK_ : Now , _UNK_ , you can &apos;t see anything in the _UNK_ , right ?
_UNK_ : Yes , but I don &apos;t call my name .
_UNK_ : Can you see the world from any point of view ?
_UNK_ : Well , I &apos;m going to get it wrong . You &apos;re OK .
Do you want the rest of the other parts ?
Then , you &apos;re all right . We &apos;ll stop one second .
_UNK_ : I &apos;m really worried what I &apos;m going to see .
_UNK_ : No , no , you &apos;re good , you &apos;re good , and you &apos;re all right . You &apos;re all right .
I &apos;m trying to look through your eyes . I can &apos;t see it .
_UNK_ : Look at the road , look at the road .
_UNK_ : No , no , I just stared at the road .
This is the most terrifying thing I &apos;ve ever done in my life .
And the _UNK_ also has a _UNK_ ,
But when _UNK_ got a car , he told me he had a --
I think it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s stuck with his leg .
So I stopped at a very fast pace .
Now , most of you will be aware of the _UNK_ . OK ,
The car had no tricks and tricks in any way .
I want you to think a little bit about it .
_UNK_ to explain what &apos;s happened , OK ?
But because your brain is not trained by _UNK_ art ,
it will be 99 percent of the time .
This is because magic is to lead your attention .
For example , I don &apos;t want you to look at my right hand ,
But if I want you to focus on my right hand ,
Now , I &apos;m going to show you one now , now .
I need two audience to come up with me .
OK , applause encourage them to come up .
Now , there &apos;s a very important thing , you have to know
You don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen . Do you agree ?
OK . Would you mind standing here for a while ?
_UNK_ : Okay , oh , tell them , that &apos;s what this is .
Can you stand here , this will be more simple .
Well , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve told you my card .
Well , _UNK_ , come up again -- they look very nervous .
Well , now , do you believe evil is evil ?
I want you to stand up like this now ,
because we &apos;re trying to do a _UNK_ experiment .
I want you to realize these feelings ,
Unless I ask you to open your eyes , do not _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : What do you feel ? What do you feel ?
_UNK_ : Two times . Okay , put your _UNK_ ahead .
Note the feeling of the turnover , do not talk , don &apos;t you ?
I just touched his back , and just contact his shoulder .
Yeah , I was in a _UNK_ like this night ,
And you sit here in a minute ,
I &apos;ll ask you to help me again , for a while .
_UNK_ , can you sit here with me ?
Now , I want you to look at me , OK .
through the breath of your nose in your mouth ,
I &apos;m just going to get you into a highly _UNK_ state ,
I &apos;m going to put your left hand here .
And I &apos;m going to keep you in that moment .
and you &apos;re going to allow your hands
to dive and drift up and down to the table ,
It &apos;s like the _UNK_ of the water and the _UNK_ .
to allow it to go back to the table .
I want you to put your hands on the table .
Well , for a moment , you feel a certain amount of pressure , OK ,
And I want you to feel the pressure ,
I just want you to control your hand
It felt that the pressure was gradually _UNK_ from the table .
OK , only when you feel the stress back ,
I want you to control your hand falling into the table .
Well , it &apos;s perfect to get us to do it again .
Put your hand on the table and keep your eyes close .
I want you to say that he &apos;s on the forehead , OK .
just when you want to release pressure ,
but you just want to release the pressure .
Remember only when you want to release pressure , we &apos;ll have a time .
and stopped there , and you stopped there , and you stopped .
Only when you feel the pressure back , then you put down the action .
You &apos;re going to do a little faster , but he &apos;s still going to go , very good .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
When you hear me _UNK_ , then you _UNK_ it .
or forget or remember what had just happened .
A lot of people will ask you what &apos;s going to happen here ?
But there &apos;s no problem , you don &apos;t even get _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , _UNK_ , wake up .
I &apos;ve seen a film called &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot;
And you remember when they took the bottle to the plane ,
Is it on the ground but there is no _UNK_ ?
Sometimes the _UNK_ will bend or melted , sometimes not .
Sometimes the object is going to fly into the table , sometimes not .
It &apos;s going to look at how much energy you have ,
We &apos;re going to do some _UNK_ experiments now .
Ensure that it is strong , only a _UNK_ , a common bottle of Coke .
If you think , you can go to the table .
Well , I want you to use two fingers and _UNK_ here .
Now I have a piece of glass fragments here .
You have a look at the piece of paper .
Be careful , because it &apos;s too sharp . Just take it a little while .
You want to imagine the relationship between the _UNK_ ,
but I ask you to be very seriously .
In this period , you will feel certain , good .
You &apos;re going to put this piece into the bottle .
Think of the man , the guy . _UNK_ the man ,
It may take some time -- put it in the bottle .
Think about his name , thinking about him , in the bottle .
and you &apos;re going to be able to _UNK_ the bottle .
There is a lot of negative energy in it .
I need you to think about his name . Look at my name .
Well , think about his name has a couple of letters .
You don &apos;t respond , so it &apos;s four letters .
Think about a letter of his name .
His name has a K , a letter ,
Think how I know , because my name is _UNK_ ,
But his name is not K , it &apos;s M _UNK_ .
Next time you see Mike and give me a _UNK_ .
I have one thing to share with you .
In fact , Chris , I had to choose you to join ,
But now you &apos;re going to come up with me to choose people ,
And the victim should be a man , and this is the only requirement .
_UNK_ : I was going to choose you ,
but I decided to take it back next year .
_UNK_ : Well , Steve , I &apos;m going to sit down and sit down at the back .
Because I &apos;m a magician , they think there &apos;s something below ,
Now , they &apos;re not only the same width as this other .
It was obviously _UNK_ a piece of stainless steel .
I want you to check it and make sure it is strong .
_UNK_ : Okay , Steve , I &apos;m standing in front of the table ,
When I was standing in front of the table ,
I want you to put these glasses on the mat , like this .
You want to put anything in the order and _UNK_ them up ,
So nobody knows where the nail is inside , OK ?
_UNK_ : There &apos;s no one in the audience who knows , you can solve the problem ,
I &apos;ll stop their eyes , so nobody can see what you &apos;re doing .
I can &apos;t see it , so I continue to _UNK_ the order .
_UNK_ : It &apos;s finished , oh , OK . You &apos;ve got to hide it now --
Oh , we have a whole one . We have a circle .
I don &apos;t know where you know , so you turn around .
and the audience would monitor me not _UNK_ ,
Now , you don &apos;t know where the nail is ,
and I don &apos;t know where to be .
Now , you have no way to see things through _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ : No , can it see something through it ?
I don &apos;t want anybody to see where the nail is .
And then you end up with a line . OK ?
My hand is in this way , so it &apos;s dangerous .
_UNK_ : Okay , where are you , come out to your hand .
_UNK_ : Now Steve , do you think a nail here ? Is there any or no ?
_UNK_ : I &apos;ll tell you that I &apos;ll be in the end .
Now , if this direction moves , there &apos;s no other cup of glass ?
_UNK_ : Oh , _UNK_ , he asked to do it with his left hand . Of course .
_UNK_ : Now , if this direction moves , there is no other cup ?
_UNK_ : Well , you think there &apos;s no nails below here . Is there any _UNK_ ?
Do you think the nail is under your left hand ?
Now you remember , you &apos;ve been making all your decisions .
If anyone wants to see more _UNK_ in a moment .
We need to know why people do something , and what they &apos;re doing .
I was a boy who grew up in the _UNK_ ,
I found that neither of the _UNK_ or the _UNK_ ,
I want to know that it &apos;s not a moral chemical substance .
Do you think about it ? I took some of this .
So I have this idea : _UNK_ may be moral .
I did a lot of people doing things : I did experiments with some of my colleagues .
But I _UNK_ that the man &apos;s brain is the same .
But he was right , it was really a silly idea .
In other words , I think I can design a test ,
Once it &apos;s produced , it &apos;s only three minutes of _UNK_ ,
So this experiment has to produce a lot of _UNK_ .
At the same time , we can detect it and _UNK_ it .
So I can &apos;t do this with _UNK_ surgery .
_UNK_ the whole moral transformation into a M variable , is a hard task .
a country , a higher percentage of trust ,
So the poor country is usually the state of low trust .
I don &apos;t want to be just _UNK_ , &quot; Are you worth trust ? &quot;
We use moral and money to _UNK_ people .
They can get 10 dollars if they come .
We gave them a lot of instructions , we never _UNK_ them .
And every one of you will get a message ,
&quot; Do you want to give up the _UNK_
to give it to another person in this lab ? &quot;
Or do you want to take some back of it ?
You sit in the _UNK_ for a half an hour .
some crazy science _UNK_ your arm , you know ,
Do you want me to give some money and give a stranger ?
The first person _UNK_ the amount of trust ,
And the second person passed the number of funds
How would the second person choose to return a penny ?
90 percent of the people choose to share their rewards ,
We find that the second person gets more money ,
First of all , there is no phenomenon in the group .
We measured the molecules of nine different kinds of _UNK_ ,
And I realized that I had to go into the brain ,
We found that the _UNK_ were used , not only by _UNK_ ,
We even want to give the money to strangers ,
and over and over and over again --
Yes , my mom was very satisfied with the last .
And after reading the movie , we have the participants to evaluate their feelings ,
And at the beginning of the movie , the _UNK_ tests were tested .
We become a _UNK_ , not because of some _UNK_ ,
So if I did some harm you , I would feel miserable .
If I do something that you are happy , I &apos;ll share your joy .
is this Adam Smith , and after _UNK_ ,
and he wrote a book called &quot; _UNK_ &quot; --
It &apos;s worth how it tells us how to _UNK_ this behavior ,
I tell you that you will see a lot of moral , and _UNK_ exists .
a Sunday afternoon , a man walked into my house ,
Open the box , there is a string of _UNK_ necklace .
He said , &quot; Hey , I just _UNK_ in the _UNK_ ,
and found this . How do you think we should deal with it ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know that the _UNK_ has lost the counter . &quot;
We must find the owner . &quot; I said , &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
So we &apos;re going to talk about how to deal with it ,
&quot; I &apos;m in your gas station just now ,
I just bought my wife a diamonds , but I can &apos;t find it now . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you really saved my life ! This is my telephone number .
I &apos;ll catch back and give him 200 dollars . &quot;
I have a interview in _UNK_ 15 minutes later ,
I really need to go to work . I have to go . &quot;
He asked me again , &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You know , you &apos;re good , we &apos;re going to get the reward . &quot;
I gave you a necklace , and you give me 100 dollars ,
This is what &apos;s called the classic _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
are not the people who tried to get _UNK_ trust ,
So you open your wallet and _UNK_ your bill .
In other words , even if you express trust to them , their brain will not produce _UNK_ .
If there &apos;s a stack of money on the table , they &apos;ll be all right .
In my lab , this group has a name of a group .
These people are absolutely not the kind of thing you &apos;d like to drink .
In addition , there are some ways to suppress the production system .
About half of the people were _UNK_ by stress .
We all know that when we really have a lot of pressure ,
And there &apos;s an interesting way to suppress _UNK_ --
We _UNK_ male hormones in the experiment .
like to punish other selfish people with their own money .
Now let &apos;s think about it . In our own body ,
The male hormone in the body is ten times the women .
and it &apos;s going to take a lot more time
We don &apos;t need God or government to tell us how to do it .
I want to see what is made of every day .
Last summer I attended a wedding in the south of England .
I took out the _UNK_ and the dry ice ,
I took the bride and the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and the _UNK_ and the family friend of _UNK_ ,
The effect is in accordance with the particular distribution .
Who is the center of the wedding system ?
Who was like the bride , who loved the wedding ?
I was thinking , and it tells us
Why ? Because we need them to be
I &apos;m also worried , I &apos;m going to use a small amount of money
It is impossible to test our lives to strangers .
And even though I had the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
At the height of the _UNK_ , the plane was _UNK_ .
There are so many ways that we can connect to others .
I &apos;ve done this experiment for the press system recently .
They let reporters and editorial participation in this experiment .
One of the boys should be 22 years old ,
I said , &quot; Look , I don &apos;t know why this guy is ,
But I guess he should be talking to his mother or girlfriend . &quot;
There are so many ways that we can connect to others ,
And this is the most primitive human beings in the world .
It &apos;s also my favorite , but it &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;m glad to share this little love on this planet .
And we found that there was a lot of people
Of course , if you don &apos;t like to touch somebody &apos;s body , I can get this nose in your nose .
Be cool . Be sure . Be sure to listen .
Usually , when I &apos;m out of the show , people will call ,
I was on the rock show , on the _UNK_ ,
And then I &apos;m going to go , and I &apos;m like ,
Can I see it ? My hand is near the _UNK_ , the tone rises .
So my hand is far away , the greater the volume is .
And it seems that you &apos;re going to come up with a single note ,
And sometimes I was surprised . I forgot that it was open ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ , oh ! It &apos;s like this .
And you have a strange _UNK_ around you ,
And then David &apos;s &quot; Listen , &quot; _UNK_ left , &quot;
After _UNK_ , I should go back to my body .
I was thinking that people normally would ask questions .
Well , I think I can tell you
_UNK_ invented _UNK_ in the _UNK_ century ,
And he was both a musician and an inventor ,
And when he was studying the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And he thought that he had made _UNK_ ,
There &apos;s this sound in the signal -- it &apos;s like --
And he thought , oh , maybe I could control that sound
_UNK_ it into a instrument because there are different _UNK_ in it .
He finally made the _UNK_ of the present _UNK_ .
when we talk about the _UNK_ of the death ,
because it was used in the &apos; 50s and _UNK_ ,
They made such a funny sound that they did .
And when you look at it , you know ,
If you want to control it as much as possible , you &apos;ll have to stand up .
It made me think of a balance balance done earlier , Michael did .
because you have to work hard at the _UNK_ ,
and it doesn &apos;t work at the same time .
You can &apos;t have too much concentration on it ;
And then you try to stay still still ,
because the little movement of your body
will influence the pitch , sometimes you play bass ,
If I was playing the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
like a _UNK_ device , because it makes you
is very _UNK_ about the situation of your body ,
or noticed that there was no movement in the play :
For example , suddenly the movement of a sudden .
If I go to the bar , people say ,
I &apos;m going to play it right now ,
I don &apos;t imagine the tone of this …
In addition , it also reflects your mood ,
And you &apos;re not going to be able to do it ,
You &apos;ve got to listen to your ears and constantly adjusted .
you have to adjust the words that are going to happen .
a little bit of a _UNK_ tone came out ,
and then _UNK_ it , and then play it ,
Or you &apos;re too tired , like I &apos;m .
And then I &apos;m going to play &quot; _UNK_ &quot; : this is one of my favorites .
I &apos;m not sure if I want to see myself ,
_UNK_ , after nine or six in the morning ,
Anyway , it was a privilege to see the _UNK_
Of course , the perfect combination of hands and performance instruments .
and as he told us that we were young
In fact , my goal is to get the world to listen
It sounds very simple , but it &apos;s really a hard job , really hard .
because you know , for example , when you see a piece of music ,
Now let me open my little _UNK_ and want to find
a piece of music is full of black _UNK_ .
and open it and read this piece of music
I &apos;m going to have a _UNK_ and rhythm on the score .
Please allow me to play the front line . It &apos;s easy to understand .
But here , let me look at this , this music is going fast .
I know where the score is going to be .
which part of the drum is playing with a drum .
And I found that this little _UNK_ _UNK_
So , if I read something from the score , it would feel like this .
like that . My career is probably about five years .
But as a musician , I did nothing to do with music .
that we don &apos;t have to learn from the teacher .
But this is what you find when you &apos;re not with your instrument ,
And it &apos;s really fun , and then you want to explore
Just now , we felt a way to translate the score into the instrument .
But the same thing , if I look at you , I &apos;ll see
a beautiful woman with the pink cap ,
You &apos;re _UNK_ a _UNK_ , and so on .
So I &apos;m going to get a basic personal impression , like what you might be ,
your profession , and so on and so on .
But the first thing that &apos;s going to happen
When you look at it , then we try to explain
In the same way , when I look at a music , I get a basic idea
I &apos;m thinking , what &apos;s going to be the answer to technology , how do I do ?
I &apos;d like to hear a little bit about it .
First of all , we have to listen to ourselves
For example , when I took a drum , I didn &apos;t _UNK_ it .
You can feel the strong _UNK_ by your arm .
And you can feel it , and you don &apos;t believe it ,
But in fact , I &apos;m close to the drum .
_UNK_ it , strange that I felt more _UNK_
If I release some , let my hand and arm as a better support .
All of a sudden , I &apos;ve got more power than I &apos;ve got ,
And finally I felt , a very close , very close to a drum ,
So the same thing , I need time and instrument
I need time to be able to figure out what they &apos;re doing
For example , I &apos;m going to play a little piece of music
I think of myself as a person who will look at this technology ,
In the latter , people call a player
And so if I look at myself as a musician ,
and so on , but even a little bit different , it &apos;s worth it .
I remember when I was 12 years old ,
I started playing _UNK_ and _UNK_ , my teacher said ,
&quot; How are we going to do that ? You know , music is closely related . &quot;
&quot; Of course , I agree to you . So what is the problem ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , how do you listen to this ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , how do you listen to ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I think I &apos;m going to hear it here . &quot;
I said , &quot; I think I &apos;m also , but I &apos;m listening to my hand . &quot;
and my arm , the bone , the stomach , the chest , the chest , and so on .
From then on , one of the _UNK_ classes , we all _UNK_ the drum .
It &apos;s in a very narrow _UNK_ , like this .
There &apos;s a little bit different . And then it &apos;s going to be a little bit smaller .
And it &apos;s amazing that when your body is completely open ,
Open the hands and _UNK_ the way through it .
can be recognized by the smallest part of your fingers .
So what we often do is I put my hands on the hands
The sound of the instrument can be heard in the wall of the music classroom .
It &apos;s a long way off the ears
And of course , I mean , my ears are so many factors .
We are in the room , _UNK_ the effect of instruments ,
Like us , we are the normal human race .
But we all have our own unique , and we can &apos;t see the color of sound .
When I was older , I went to the _UNK_ of the Royal Music School in London
They said , &quot; Well , no , we can &apos;t get you because we don &apos;t have _UNK_
You know , to develop a future , called the _UNK_ _UNK_ musician .
So I said to them , &quot; Look , if you look at it ,
but the ability to do it , to understand music .
I can &apos;t imagine what you want to hire students
And the result is that we _UNK_ a very small obstacle and get the chance to pick up again .
And at that time , it changed its way
In any case , they can &apos;t refuse any applicant .
They could still play the wind , as long as the instrument
No matter any circumstances , it should be used to apply any _UNK_ .
Every applicant should be heard , and it &apos;s got to feel ,
based on music , and then decide whether this person is allowed .
And that means that there &apos;s a rather interesting student
to be able to learn in these _UNK_ music schools
And I had to say that they were very _UNK_
But what &apos;s interesting about this is that
In fact , people are not just connected to sound ,
And basically all of us , we all know that music is really good for us .
In fact , some of the extraordinary things that I &apos;ve experienced
As a musician , you might have a 15 year-old boy
And he could not control his own actions .
and it &apos;s possible to be deaf , blind , and so on .
And suddenly , if this young boy sat next to the instrument ,
And then you play a very _UNK_ sound ,
maybe I &apos;m going to take the wrong thing .
But he could feel what I couldn &apos;t feel .
And for him , the sound was heard from the _UNK_ .
And if you don &apos;t have any _UNK_ ,
he could hear a full sound and sit in front of you .
It doesn &apos;t have to feel like that , of course , the back is not .
Each of us depends on where we sit .
And of course , as the _UNK_ of sound ,
And this started with what I wanted to create .
But we felt that what was going on
In the same way , when I see trees in _UNK_ ,
I can imagine the sound of the tree
Whatever the eyes see , there is always a sound
_UNK_ , a lot of different things as my voice &apos;s source .
So , all my show is based on some of my experiences
to learn a piece of music , not to join other people .
or study some of the _UNK_ that are related to that music , etc .
because it doesn &apos;t get me to the original thing .
that makes me feel exactly what &apos;s going on .
So it &apos;s possible that in some _UNK_ , it &apos;s going to be nice .
maybe in other places , people would not have felt that .
So , I made a tone of voice ,
to understand what I mean ? So , it &apos;s a special factor of getting sound .
in terms of sound . It &apos;s not just a way to treat it .
But that means that the acoustic worker needs to think about the _UNK_ type
what they chose . In this world , there are few _UNK_
I dare say , but even so , you can still _UNK_ the wings and do anything .
I dare say , but even so , you can still _UNK_ the wings and do anything .
It might be nice to listen here , and there might be no good .
It &apos;s a nightmare , but it &apos;s listening to it , and so on .
as you can imagine the effect of that .
So , in fact , the sound workers are in and some
I can &apos;t tell you how the current progress is .
I can &apos;t tell you how the current progress is .
&quot; Look , how do they feel music ? You know , they &apos;re deaf . &quot;
We &apos;ve been thinking about how _UNK_ should be .
Or we can imagine how blind people should be .
When we see somebody sitting on the _UNK_ , we think they don &apos;t walk .
Maybe they can go for a few steps . And this is for them ,
And maybe a year later , they can take a lot of time
We should be able to listen to ourselves first .
really _UNK_ our body as a _UNK_ . _UNK_ the surface .
For me , as a musician who is dealing with new music ,
I like to say , &quot; Oh , yes , I love that first .
Oh , I don &apos;t like that . &quot; It &apos;s easy to do that .
But I found that I should give more time
It was possible that I had nothing to do with that song .
But it doesn &apos;t mean I have the right to evaluate , it &apos;s not the first piece .
In fact , this is the best thing to feel
So there is no rules , no _UNK_ , no way .
If I let you take a _UNK_ , maybe I can do that .
And if I said , &quot; Please take _UNK_ . &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
What I mean is really _UNK_ to listen to the _UNK_ .
and then by _UNK_ the voice of the _UNK_ ,
OK ! So the noise of snow is that you &apos;ve heard ?
_UNK_ : So , stop . Come on . ( _UNK_ )
You know , it &apos;s really interesting that I &apos;ve made a group of children
However , no one of you left the seat and thought ,
Maybe I could create something different with my _UNK_ .
And maybe I could make some sound in my body .
No one tried to take a little bit of a bit of a bit of a _UNK_ .
In addition to the seat , the hands of his hands
And when we listen to music , it &apos;s the same thing .
We thought we could only feel it through this .
This is how we feel music . Of course , it &apos;s not that .
We felt a lot of noise -- thunder , and I thought ,
Listen to now , how do we deal with _UNK_ ?
I remember one of my teachers , when I started learning music , my earliest course ,
I &apos;m going to be ready , and I &apos;m going to be filled with confidence .
And yet , he said , &quot; Okay , _UNK_ , the legs are divided apart ,
The arm was 90 degrees , and the drum was about _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ them , and so on and so forth . &quot;
At the end , I became very stiff , like being _UNK_ .
and I could not learn how to do it .
because I &apos;ve been thinking about other things , and he said to me ,
&quot; _UNK_ the drum back seven days , I &apos;ll see you next week . &quot;
My God ! How do I do that ? I can &apos;t do it again .
I can only look at the drum
how it works , small hands are available , what _UNK_ do .
and flip it over and try it , and it &apos;s _UNK_ .
And of course , when I returned , I was _UNK_ .
Because of that experience , where do you feel like that ?
Where do you feel that in a textbook ?
So we &apos;ve never really been studying textbooks .
For example , we &apos;ve learned a way to play
As a _UNK_ , _UNK_ isn &apos;t a musician , when we deal with music ,
like this and then go faster , faster , faster , faster .
What do you think about this kind of thing ?
Right . So why can I use this style of music ?
What &apos;s interesting is that as age grows , when I became a professional student ,
In the so-called music school , those _UNK_ have disappeared .
&quot; Why ? Why do you learn what ? &quot; These problems often appear in my mind ?
I need to play music . &quot; Oh , learn to control ! &quot;
So , how do you learn to control it ? Why do I need to learn ? I need to connect it to music
Is it really for a good control ? Why do I do that ?
And the answer needs to be told by music
through music , it was actually through the sound ,
And we can pass all of these things to _UNK_
But I don &apos;t want to be responsible for the emotional _UNK_
It &apos;s decided that when you walk into a hall ,
because we decided how to listen to something
I may feel sad , or be happy , or angry , or when I play
So the next time you go to _UNK_ ,
let your body open , and it becomes your _UNK_ .
that you &apos;re not going to be influenced by the player &apos;s emotion .
The player may be in the _UNK_ position
And what they heard was the sound of the drum .
or the sound of the _UNK_ , or the sound of the _UNK_ , and so on .
or to make the sound of the instrument ,
remember the whole process of _UNK_ the sound from the beginning .
Or it starts to try to feel the whole journey of sound ,
It &apos;s like I &apos;ve spent my entire journey ,
And this meeting today , although yesterday night it was here ,
I hope we can have the opportunity to communicate
These young people who are gathered on the Internet
Tom Green : Oh yeah . They &apos;ve been _UNK_ me for a year .
_UNK_ , this is about to take me off .
And sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night , shouting ,
So I took them models and translated it into English ,
and then put my friends on the Internet .
There is no file . There is no limit . There is no sign .
And it can be launched by a campaign
_UNK_ , a large number of videos and many known as _UNK_ culture .
The two big _UNK_ that this website is launched ,
One is that some people may be familiar with _UNK_ --
But when you click in , you just see the popular song in the &apos; 80s .
But the bigger it is , the bigger it is ,
In the last year , a parade of _UNK_ &apos;s _UNK_ Day
This website has created a lot of &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
Some of the things that go into the mainstream culture ,
And of course , some of the rules that I wanted to come out
So they came up with a set of rules ,
I &apos;d like to introduce the three rules ,
If there is a real existence , it has no exceptions .
A third of the visitors on the website are there .
and there are more amazing things about it .
And as Chris had just mentioned it ,
And _UNK_ also learned the news . My community
I didn &apos;t show them . They just decided that they wanted to do it .
As such a result , you know , there is a high - level support for _UNK_ .
They &apos;re not just the first one on the top ,
is that we can control the better ways
And what they do is they spend time and effort
It &apos;s a group of people who call themselves a _UNK_ channel .
_UNK_ has a _UNK_ video . It &apos;s on the Web .
But someone took it off the Internet and _UNK_ a part of the Internet .
And there are hundreds of cities in the world ,
So we have this group of _UNK_ activists ,
And finally , I &apos;m going to show you an example ,
_UNK_ is the name of a cat for us .
And what you know is that a lot of people are _UNK_ ,
What they did was they could make _UNK_ _UNK_ ( TV ) on the scene of crime .
They got videos on YouTube and _UNK_ all the contents .
I think we &apos;re going to go to these situations , and we &apos;ve lost a lot ,
If I asked , the TED website will not be _UNK_ ?
CA : Who knows , maybe some of them --
We have people from 75 countries to watch TED .
But you need to face problems like _UNK_ content .
And we can get more benefits --
Now there &apos;s too little places that you can get into
And anything you want , I think , is a powerful force .
But now you want to be a _UNK_ action .
But I think that there is an important thing in these places .
And when I get email , people say , &quot; Thank you for a space
It can be constructive , but it &apos;s also quite destructive .
If you cut a knife and talk to you ,
I think that &apos;s going to be a big danger .
CA : I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;ve got a _UNK_
because I didn &apos;t basically tell them anything about it .
But there are some good things to do .
CA : Now the whole plate is this thing .
Is it possible ? Is it still on the Internet ?
_UNK_ : I &apos;ll leave the Internet a few days ago .
I don &apos;t know what the current advice is ,
to come to TED to see the website .
Chris , how do you say ? You &apos;re actually a very interesting figure .
But you don &apos;t seem to have the money yet .
_UNK_ : Well , there &apos;s no business prospects for it .
It &apos;s clear that it has some very _UNK_ content ,
When you have these things on the Internet , you basically sacrifice
_UNK_ : I got my mother &apos;s house , now I went back to school .
CA : What do you have with your mother ?
The content on the Web is really talking about the table .
But my parents -- and I think the reason
CA : They &apos;re going to be happy to see you
_UNK_ : Yeah . But they don &apos;t know how to think about it .
As I said , I just went back to school ,
is to take what I learned from the Internet
CA : Chris , thank you . Thank you very much for TED .
So I &apos;m going to talk about the land animals
although it &apos;s just a long time in evolution ,
And for us , there is a profound meaning .
because they are part of our experience _UNK_ .
to prosperity and replace them . We &apos;re going to do that .
It &apos;s very important to know . So this is the important clue .
We know that like the tsunami , the earthquake ,
that we live in the _UNK_ of our lives
and even in most of the scientists ,
that scientists and natural _UNK_ in different areas
the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
And it turns out that this is a good way
And the _UNK_ is the period of _UNK_ --
So my job is to try to figure out
and see if you can see it from dinosaurs and other animals ,
For example , the mammals used to live in water .
You can go outside and see a lot of these examples .
is attacked 500 to 10 million years ,
We have plenty of animals to go to water . Why don &apos;t the dinosaurs do that ?
Why don &apos;t the dinosaurs live in the trees ?
Why don &apos;t they do that ? If they don &apos;t live in these places ,
If there &apos;s no animal life , it can tell us
It &apos;s a very interesting problem . I think this is a lot of different sizes .
In fact , most of them have certain relationships --
and I &apos;ve been working on the site for years ,
And it seems that all the things are _UNK_ ,
that evolution is much slower than we think .
They evolved to measure the maximum size of the body ?
But what we &apos;re interested in is that these dinosaurs have spent a long time .
and it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ year .
And the mammals are only three hundred years old ,
This particular case we are familiar with today because _UNK_ and us all over the world
to all kinds of discoveries that have been done .
This slide was shown before , a famous _UNK_ .
We now know that this is going to change
and we &apos;re going to talk about where they start .
It was the time that they were _UNK_
In fact , in the journal Science and &quot; Nature , &quot;
This bird was named by the _UNK_ of our name .
We call it Chinese bird . It &apos;s better than _UNK_ .
If you analyze different formation , you will find
Every layer down , the creatures are more _UNK_ .
So if you find a new fossil , we usually have to analyze it ,
or more appropriate , it is a feather .
This is actually from one habitat to another .
This is one of the most important events in our evolutionary journey .
I think if I want to know how the dinosaurs evolved ,
because _UNK_ found the fragments of dinosaurs , that was dinosaurs .
I want to show you a little clip here ,
Let &apos;s know something about what we face . Usually , we ask a lot of questions ,
For example , &quot; How do you find the fossil in this area ? &quot;
We &apos;re running over the _UNK_ , the top of the _UNK_
At the bottom of the _UNK_ , we could hardly find the fossil .
And there we found the oldest dinosaur _UNK_ there .
And in this area you need a _UNK_ ,
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a best team to follow you .
And finally on us . We had to find the fossil fossil .
You have to dig a little hole than that .
to dig it out ; you have to climb up these _UNK_ .
not only dinosaurs , but the whole _UNK_ story . If you &apos;re lucky enough ,
You &apos;re going to dig , in fact , we &apos;re doing that .
at least there are four legs of them .
And I &apos;m going to look at this skull ,
five to six inches long , it &apos;s pretty beautiful .
This is the origin of dinosaurs , and then it goes out to all places .
It &apos;s going to be about 10 times larger .
Why is it that the dinosaurs have been discovered
And most of these evidence is on the southern continent ,
there was almost no footprint for the human population .
If you want to add something to this painting , to make it more perfect ,
you have to be able to do it .
I &apos;ve been to some of the mainland , just Africa ,
In _UNK_ , a large degree of a slate ,
But the middle is a big piece of _UNK_ ,
There was no road to _UNK_ desert , which was a _UNK_ place .
80 tons of tons of _UNK_ in the desert .
to move out , you have to have a _UNK_
And some of these difficulties are political reasons , many are physical ,
And there are some more important , the spiritual spirit .
You &apos;re going to have all kinds of bad conditions --
The spirit of science is _UNK_ , and the spirit is _UNK_ .
as a lead -- this is a team movement --
You have to try to _UNK_ them .
And in this case , the _UNK_ of _UNK_
So you &apos;d better put the metal tool under the sun ,
If the _UNK_ meets them , it will be serious .
and you find yourself in a culture environment ,
They are _UNK_ . They &apos;re in the Sahara .
your job is to dig these _UNK_ out ,
To do that , you need to take these from the desert
What we &apos;re saying now is Ethiopia , but what we &apos;re going to talk about --
the _UNK_ River -- the northern part of the _UNK_ --
The _UNK_ River does not have a container - deposit in the west .
and then _UNK_ the boat to get them to the middle of the ship .
And we &apos;re using the hidden _UNK_ there ,
some of the important dinosaurs -- about 20 tons --
This is a _UNK_ that we haven &apos;t seen on other continents ,
It looks like a little bit _UNK_ around the environment .
to find a little bit different from the fossil .
the great zoo . When you get this thing --
Some people have been able to touch something like this --
This is a history , and it &apos;s over the last six years .
It was _UNK_ , and it soon found it in this dinosaur .
When we start thinking about time depth ,
It &apos;s not about 100 years of history ,
less than a century ago , the invention of radioactive _UNK_ technology
to allow us to _UNK_ these fossil age ,
It changed the way we looked at ourselves and the world .
And when you understand the stories behind the fossil ,
And this is the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
This is the giant that we found in _UNK_ .
We scan the skull and made a skull _UNK_ .
This is the cover of Science magazine , and someone thought
But we can see in some examples of the agency
all the things you know in this film --
This is the first skeleton of a continent ,
It doesn &apos;t look like a _UNK_ next to its _UNK_ .
So we &apos;re trying to get back to the initial situation ,
We don &apos;t have a _UNK_ for this terrible _UNK_ ,
And what happened was that the _UNK_ was
Generally speaking , this is a science , but it is more exact .
The first person : _UNK_ the teeth ! It &apos;s got a _UNK_ .
Number one : I need more people . The second person : I come .
_UNK_ : It &apos;s Paul coming to _UNK_ its eyes .
Number one : Be careful ! No , no , no , you go to the _UNK_ .
Second man : Are you really _UNK_ ? No , your _UNK_ is my _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : We &apos;re going to take a look at it . It &apos;s there .
The first person : _UNK_ . _UNK_ : 14 feet long .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ ! Don &apos;t worry about it ! No worry about me .
Paul : Oh , it &apos;s hard to stay here ! It &apos;s on top !
_UNK_ : Paul never seen a _UNK_ that would be done .
You know , the fossil record is very important ,
because it forces you to understand the animals right now .
But the percentage of the body is an excuse for the bone ,
We measure the skeleton of our _UNK_ , and we publish it to science .
This giant _UNK_ , 40 feet long ( 12 meters ) , is a _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to lead a team to the desert
is an important demonstration of the _UNK_ tribes .
We &apos;ve been waiting for us to go back . So , we &apos;re very excited .
The next reason for work , we went to Tibet .
Now , we usually think that Tibet is a _UNK_ .
There &apos;s no one in the past . Now we know where it is ,
and it &apos;s going to go there next year .
But there is no big problem if the Spring season goes there .
Now , I &apos;m going to link these pieces into a dinosaur .
I &apos;ve already talked about it , but we &apos;re going to do more deeply .
We need to study these kinds of things
to understand what happens when it &apos;s going to change .
We don &apos;t have to predict the evolution of evolution ,
But we can understand the rules of evolution ,
These are animals that live on land . There are lots of choices .
From one plate to another plate , you _UNK_ this isolated ,
or you live in another plate , and you make some changes .
The fourth possibility is that your situation belongs to
One of these three people , but _UNK_ haven &apos;t found you yet .
So , besides digging , I think we can go from
There &apos;s some answers to the dinosaurs . I think dinosaurs had moved --
We call _UNK_ in the global scale , through the most narrow continental connections .
They are connected by two or three connected
But sometimes they are really _UNK_ , and they &apos;re really _UNK_ ,
But I think there is a more important thing , that &apos;s the extinction .
The best way to test this theory is to build a model .
If we look at it , this is a _UNK_ tree .
The trees _UNK_ with the time of the time .
After seeing the _UNK_ of time , we added the third dimension --
We control the parameters that we care about :
to simulate what the continents looked like ,
We can estimate these parameters by a thousand times ,
So we can see if our work is in the right direction ,
at least to know the difficulty of the problem . It &apos;s a little bit about science .
I &apos;m going to take the rest of the time today
to talk about what I did in Chicago ,
And it &apos;s going to be a matter of fact --
And I talked about it before TED ,
Many of you are there -- I don &apos;t know if I get a answer .
_UNK_ , if I let you raise your hands ,
will find that many of you in this room
It &apos;s a failure , whether it &apos;s in society , or in school standards .
I &apos;m an example of failure . I &apos;m studying bad at school -- school is not confident .
In school , I am a complete loser , high school without graduation .
I went to my direction -- that was my first painting .
I did a folder and went to New York City .
And sometimes I see a body , I &apos;ll study its bones .
Some _UNK_ , I went to a studio in New York City .
I went to the American Museum and never went to _UNK_ .
But it &apos;s really the same thing -- they &apos;re _UNK_ .
For dinosaurs , a small part of the bones of dinosaurs
I &apos;m going to show you a face because the face is most familiar .
After years of research , we know how to apply this to dinosaur .
It is a loser in the aspect of science .
We all know that these failure are _UNK_ .
we don &apos;t have a society that we can
We agree that we &apos;ve been through the early stages of exploration ,
This problem is getting worse . Where are we going to come from ?
And a more common problem is that ,
And for those children that are behind ,
And that kid , like I was reading at school --
that we never had the opportunity in school
This is my question . I &apos;m going to talk about Ethiopia . It &apos;s important .
What do you do ? They give two questions .
So we can attract more tourists , tourism is our second pillar industry .
I hope the U.S. government , I , or at TED ,
or other people can do that because it &apos;s too important for their country .
But when we go back to our country , we look at our cities ,
These _UNK_ our cities -- of course , _UNK_ me --
The problem is -- we start to solve this problem in the centuries ago --
how to make these children go into science .
We knew them in high school . They knew them .
Now they &apos;re a university in Chicago , and another one was in Illinois .
We have Harvard students . Our institutions have six years of history .
Because once you become a scholar , you &apos;re going to try to _UNK_ ,
For example , the records are very few .
We create amazing results , 100 percent of the population .
It took 90 percent of the scientific research as a professional .
This is a very profound record , so let &apos;s say ,
We &apos;re not going to start with the theory ,
But we looked back and found that theory supports our scientific education .
and you learn how to imagine yourself as a scientist .
You learn to have these steps . If you have --
It &apos;s hard to think of themselves as a scientist ,
It &apos;s the same thing as I &apos;m doing right now ,
and you can see yourself as a scientist ,
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . We plan to build a permanent home in Chicago .
We have a lot of ideas , but I promise you a little bit about it --
And I was talking to some people at TED --
What I &apos;m going to say is that you never have seen it .
I like to interact with our robot more like
American aviation and space Administration launched the first robot on Mars .
_UNK_ , the robot is never in our home .
It &apos;s not a social way of doing it .
For me , this is blank , this is a robot that can &apos;t do it .
So that year , I started making this robot , _UNK_ ,
and other graduate students work in the lab --
Scientists : This is my watch to my girlfriend .
Scientists : Look , it has a little blue light in it .
It &apos;s like a kid who can &apos;t talk to or sounds ,
I think it &apos;s right because it &apos;s the first _UNK_ robot .
I &apos;m deeply touched the _UNK_ of our heart .
And so this _UNK_ that we can _UNK_ with robots
I &apos;ve been exploring all these things that are interacting with people ,
We &apos;ve developed _UNK_ with _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I want to show you a very special moment with _UNK_ .
Because it &apos;s new things , _UNK_ don &apos;t know how to do it .
But it &apos;s kind of like us , and he can look at it
It &apos;s kind of hard to begin with ,
There &apos;s this change in thinking that we can now imagine
But what am I saying , &quot; _UNK_ the buttons we communicate ? &quot;
is that if we designed these robots to communicate with us
with the same language as human beings --
like _UNK_ , our _UNK_ robots are doing here --
And we found that we respond to robots
And people decided to decide how many people have _UNK_ ,
The robot actually becomes a very interesting new science tool .
to answer questions like this : from a very short meeting ,
Can we judge how much is it worth trust ?
is it not to mimic a particular posture ?
to learn these or understand that these are very difficult .
because when we interact , we don &apos;t make all these _UNK_ .
We can &apos;t control them because they &apos;re our unconscious .
This is a video made in the _UNK_ laboratory .
And the conclusion is -- the reason why it works --
And it turns out that people are doing things like humans .
For example , if robots respond to our non - language ,
They may be a very cool , new communication technology .
You can tell your friend , she put her _UNK_ in a robot ,
You can communicate with your friend , you can communicate with your friends ,
Maybe it &apos;s going to come back and be true , isn &apos;t it ?
We called some of the _UNK_ in our lab
to see a series of things on the table ,
and talk about these things to do a particular task -- eventually a survival mission --
and how important it is to make it .
_UNK_ is a test crew from our group .
The second type we added mobility , a portable screen .
Like , if you &apos;re familiar with any remote _UNK_ --
We asked people to work with a remote partner
to assess the quality of their interaction with technology ,
How many of you think about the other person ?
And this is the result of the screen .
If you join mobility -- the ability to turn on the table --
But if you add a fully expressed , you can get better .
Now you put this into a social environment .
We know that there are more and more _UNK_
And that distance really gives us a family relationship
I want them to do with their _UNK_ ,
So they don &apos;t see each other too often .
But my children are still small -- they don &apos;t want to talk ,
And they would like this robot to be
And so I think it &apos;s not going to be far away --
Open a _UNK_ window and _UNK_ a little robot .
I can imagine _UNK_ and their girls , their friends
and can share all the other activities around the house ,
more than 5,000 people are overweight or obese ,
Now our children have the same problem as well .
We know that if you &apos;re older and older ,
If you &apos;re obese in youth , it leads to chronic diseases .
And it &apos;s also a massive economic burden on health care systems .
The robot is the presence of friendly support .
is always going to help you make the right choice .
So we &apos;ve actually been exploring this idea .
_UNK_ invented this robot for his Ph.D. paper .
He was designed to exercise exercise training for a robot .
It &apos;s made of some simple non - language skills .
It can give you a bow to the screen .
And he can track the records of the world
So it can form with you by talking ,
It &apos;s helping to build goals and record your process ,
Is it really important to this community ? Is this carrier a robot ?
or the quality of knowledge and information ?
In a few weeks , we took three steps
a robot that you &apos;ve seen , you know , _UNK_ .
Another one is a _UNK_ interface with the same screen ,
The third is a pen and a piece of paper ,
So what we really want to focus on
but how long they can communicate with robots .
because the challenge is not _UNK_ weight , but keep the weight down .
So you can interact with these steps ,
So the first thing I want to see is how long it is ,
And it turns out that people are interacting with robots
The quality and computer are exactly the same .
when you ask people to assess the quality of each other ,
Even when we ended up learning about _UNK_ robots ,
They would like to come out of the car and say _UNK_ .
And the last thing I want to talk about today
We know that kids now spend more time on the screen ,
My son , they love the screen . They love the screen .
But I want them to play , if a mom wanted them ,
So I want to show you a new project
And this is what we want to do
There is a lot of nature in the real world .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ character can go into your world ?
when the cartoon character becomes real and into their world .
They can play with it , and they play with a screen
completely different ways , play with it in reality .
So the kids are doing the change in reality .
So here , _UNK_ _UNK_ A to _UNK_ the number 2 .
He can give these characters a special force .
So they &apos;re going to _UNK_ the world now .
And finally , what I &apos;ve been trying to do
They can get them part of the story ,
As I was a young girl watching &quot; Star Wars &quot; was inspired .
I want them to really take their imagination
to allow kids to project their ideas in this space ,
I really wanted to find a new direction for kids
We asked some children to come to this space ,
But I can tell you that what they love is ,
_UNK_ : Is it just left , right , left , right , right ?
I mean , we &apos;ve run for two million years ,
It seems to have a bit of a _UNK_ .
But as I found , the most cool thing about running
_UNK_ : A few months ago , if you look at the _UNK_ race ,
She didn &apos;t win any _UNK_ game in eight years ,
_UNK_ has been ready to _UNK_ , from this movement ,
except for the bad news -- other people have the same idea ,
She was not only behind the _UNK_ of the order ;
In _UNK_ , this one must win a great deal of money .
Suddenly she had her leg and began to _UNK_ .
We all know how this is going to work , _UNK_ ?
You &apos;re going to come to her in a _UNK_ .
and said , &quot; _UNK_ , keep up with us . You can do that . &quot;
She tried to run her for the second time .
It &apos;s an incredible story that we all know how to end up .
But what she took home is more important .
She had no loss , she won the competition more than the leading team ,
It &apos;s possible to know what happened at the time .
When you know somebody else in the _UNK_ ,
It was no coincidence that it was more competitive than compassionate .
You show me a creature with a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
There is a certain connection between people who have heart .
and found in the _UNK_ of Mexico ,
When the Spanish _UNK_ arrived in North America , only two choices :
or to fight back and fight , or leave .
This is why the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ are now very _UNK_ .
is that after age -- 70 to 80 --
all the things we &apos;re going to talk about today ,
all of the things that we &apos;re trying to use
all of the technology and the _UNK_ --
and crime , war , violence and clinical depression --
All of these , the _UNK_ did not know the _UNK_ .
There is a certain extent of the _UNK_ relationship .
is trying to figure out how to understand
They are trying to solve the same kind of puzzle .
And again , a mystery contained in another puzzle --
Maybe the answer to _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_
is that there are three other mysteries , like this :
three things -- if anybody knows the answer , please get up and get up the microphone ,
But if you know the answer , you are smarter than anyone on the planet .
The brain capacity of two million years ago was _UNK_ .
you need to have an active source of calories .
In other words , the animal of early human beings --
The initial weapon had only appeared in about 400 years ago .
because we are the most vulnerable in the jungle .
that any other animal is more powerful than us .
They have _UNK_ , they have sharp , flexible , they are _UNK_ .
We thought it was going to run fast . It was a _UNK_ .
It can be a Olympic game : let &apos;s stop a _UNK_ .
Who has caught the _UNK_ , who is the gold _UNK_ .
No weapon , no speed , no power , no _UNK_ , no sharp _UNK_ .
How do we kill these animals ? The first puzzle .
Now women have been in the Olympic Games for a while ,
But one thing about all the women &apos;s _UNK_ is --
The fastest woman had a mile in four seconds .
I threw a stone and could hit a run .
Because of some reasons , you &apos;re really running slowly .
But we went back to the _UNK_ we &apos;ve just talked about --
You &apos;re just ready to run the _UNK_ for 20 years .
The medicine showed that if a woman was trying to run 26 miles --
Anybody know what happens if you try to run 26 miles ,
Why are you forbidden to join the _UNK_ before the _UNK_ ?
The uterus will be lost , not _UNK_ , lost in the body .
So , for 20 years , women were allowed to go to _UNK_ .
to change the fact that the world record is only
until the medical department told us that the fatal distance --
and remember that _UNK_ died in 26 miles --
you can get the _UNK_ and the _UNK_
who participate in 50 or 100 miles , against anyone in the world .
No one has a good _UNK_ at the same time .
And a couple of years ago , _UNK_ took place
It &apos;s all you need to know about the game .
The _UNK_ has 48 hours to finish the game .
She did a match and 10 times before the top ,
Even in the game she stopped at every _UNK_ .
In _UNK_ University , they track people out
is , if you start running _UNK_ at the age of 19 ,
You know that your speed will fall down to the speed of 19 .
So there &apos;s about _UNK_ time to get to your peak ,
You might think it would take a couple of hours to fall back to the original speed ,
as fast as they run at the age of 19 .
Now I can &apos;t show you any other sports movement --
Don &apos;t say _UNK_ -- some of the really hard motion --
When the global answer , you should be very careful ,
What you say is _UNK_ , then you throw the _UNK_ on the side .
If you put a piece in the middle of this puzzle ,
All of a sudden it came out of a coherent painting .
If you want to know why the _UNK_ is not fighting .
will be the most compassionate and most competitive ,
and we are pleased to think we are the owner of the universe ,
because one of the advantages of our land --
And again , it &apos;s not our _UNK_ , _UNK_ and speed --
The only advantage we have is to have sweat .
We can be very _UNK_ than any other mammals on the planet .
And in fact , when you talk about it ,
After five or six miles , the horse will be ready to choose .
or you can stop it , or you can make yourself cool ,
So what if we go to hunting animals ?
If we have the only natural advantage in the world ,
is that we can get together as a community ,
to the _UNK_ of Africa , to find a _UNK_ .
and out of the crowd until it died ?
We can run a very long distance in the _UNK_ .
If this is true , some other things will be true .
The key to hunting group is the word &quot; community &quot; .
If you go out and try to find a _UNK_ ,
I assure you and _UNK_ will become two _UNK_ on the _UNK_ .
For years of _UNK_ , five years old people ,
to get them to know which _UNK_ should be caught .
The group should be some of the professional _UNK_ .
There are women and teenagers in the community ,
because there are two periods of _UNK_ in life
One is a teenager in the development of _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
and let _UNK_ die there and want to eat it .
It &apos;s a little bit less than 50 miles away .
You need those 27 years to be at the peak ,
Another thing about this group is that this group is not a profit .
You can &apos;t catch the _UNK_ on the _UNK_ .
You can &apos;t be a angry package . You can &apos;t have a _UNK_ .
He _UNK_ me . Let him go for the _UNK_ . &quot;
And the team had to _UNK_ and anger ,
is what we &apos;ve done for two million years .
is that we are all over the world .
You know , we &apos;re running as a kind of alien , foreign country ,
This is like a _UNK_ for the night before eating .
Maybe we have this natural gift of nature .
How do we get rid of it ? How do we get rid of it ?
We tried to put it into the _UNK_ , put it together and make it look better .
I &apos;m feeling a little bit _UNK_ about running shoes .
because I bought a lot of running shoes , but it was still injured .
And I thought , if there were people running around here --
We spoke for two minutes , and she talked about _UNK_ .
You &apos;re talking to a _UNK_ , and I promise , in 30 seconds ,
So if human evolution became runner , if this is one of our natural talent ,
Why don &apos;t we be good at it ? Why are we getting hurt ?
is that in our time there was a running operation .
any kind of mythology , any kind of story ,
_UNK_ , dynamic , youth and eternal power of power .
to run and run with fear and pain .
&quot; My legs are my only friend . I only trust my legs . &quot;
It used to run 50 miles across the desert ,
to join a _UNK_ and steal a bunch of horse
My weakness -- I &apos;m _UNK_ . I need to rest a week , &quot;
We are in the age of today . We have numbers .
just by their _UNK_ and their legs ,
How long are we going to have this ability ?
OK , I &apos;ll suggest you &apos;re going to first
Put all the packaging , all sales , all the sales and all the business .
We need to find the kind of playful and play ,
is one of the most healthy and quiet culture in our age .
So you &apos;ve got to throw away the _UNK_ from the night ?
a way to make people more quiet , quiet , healthier .
You don &apos;t have to go back to office like crazy _UNK_ ,
and you don &apos;t have a big pressure back home .
I &apos;m not saying that let &apos;s go back to _UNK_ ,
to make a _UNK_ of corn and corn ,
It may be able to get a big Nobel prize .
we can enjoy most of the time running ,
What I see today is that there &apos;s a growth
The _UNK_ &apos;s _UNK_ , and the people don &apos;t wear their shoes .
you don &apos;t wear a shoe , you can put pressure on it ,
to get rid of the injured and disease .
It was a long time ago at _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
This _UNK_ can bring a lot of fun .
I &apos;ve been injured in my life , and I &apos;m not wearing shoes .
I hope we can all benefit from that .
Thank you very much for the story . Thank you .
I &apos;m a contemporary artist . My work is on the gallery and the museum .
And I also made television programs , books and advertising .
is about our identity of famous and famous culture ,
I &apos;m going to start with this idea seven years ago ,
She died the day or the minute she died ,
The people decided to _UNK_ the death of her death .
Can anybody just _UNK_ the image of the _UNK_ ?
So I took a gun and began shooting the _UNK_ image .
And of course it will not disappear from the spiritual spirit of the public .
I felt that media had reported her death in some yellow ways ,
which part of the artery is leaving the body ,
or how she died in the back of the car .
I was interested in the _UNK_ of the public ,
I then think I can &apos;t really replace her image .
and let her get her right position and positions ,
to create some images based on the public .
He wanted to know that _UNK_ was not trying to marry a boyfriend .
So I took pictures of _UNK_ , _UNK_ and their _UNK_ children .
The photograph was _UNK_ by the public in the public .
And then I looked at the media image .
So I &apos;m going to start talking about the media image .
The media _UNK_ details and so on .
to make them more aware of their private lives
This is a picture of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ &apos;s husband .
They show up in the order of a gallery .
I am particularly interested in the notion of the public .
I was really fascinated by how people were really _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s going to be very simple .
I went on and _UNK_ the photography program ,
It &apos;s more interesting than the things in the real world .
At the same time it _UNK_ us to the real business .
and they become something that _UNK_ people .
_UNK_ became a kind of _UNK_ thing , _UNK_ people &apos;s desires .
I think it will be a success in the magazine .
Queen often goes to see her horse ,
In Britain , there is a saying , &quot; You can &apos;t imagine the _UNK_ of Queen . &quot;
All of these pictures have made a lot of _UNK_ .
I was criticized as a _UNK_ artist .
This kind of media _UNK_ makes me feel very interesting .
We understand the truth and information only from media
There are few of us who know real people .
All kinds of newspapers and comment are about these works .
The camera is _UNK_ before people really see it .
and suddenly it starts to go to the front page .
Some people pay me to do the cover photography .
And now the journalists can lie to me to tell my story and photographs ,
But the next minute will be about my terrible title .
And then I started working for the newspaper magazine .
For example , this is a picture of &quot; The _UNK_ . &quot;
It was actually on April Day , but some people thought it was true .
I was having dinner with some people a day ,
They &apos;re talking about a nice picture of Queen _UNK_ .
And I started exploring the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ and _UNK_ are important to the people &apos;s lives .
How do they put themselves into the public mind ,
I actually _UNK_ myself into a famous person .
and it looks like a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And then I made a series of _UNK_
I tried all kinds of photographs , such as _UNK_ , to stimulate the mass .
just to show a certain perspective to create _UNK_ ,
This is a photograph of _UNK_ , and the manual is huge .
But when we put her on _UNK_ and makeup ,
Even the _UNK_ husband could not recognize it ,
This series of photos are all displayed in the gallery .
I used to make a series of television programs for the BBC .
The static images in the television show also income books .
But here &apos;s a legal problem , because it looks like real ,
It clearly _UNK_ our culture right now ,
How can we tell _UNK_ when we look at something ?
And from my perspective , it &apos;s important to publish these pictures
But at the same time they make wonder
but it &apos;s a problem for me to work with media .
So I added a statement to all of my work ,
And I wrote a little story for these European or British _UNK_ .
You know , what does a private stand and his fashion teacher ?
and the idea of the public is that
_UNK_ Laden , _UNK_ , the link of the war in Iraq .
where the monarchy is going to go .
Even more support the _UNK_ of William _UNK_ than Charles .
What I have in my job is that these public wishes , or desires .
I used to make the ad of Coca - Cola _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s a very interesting thing about the law .
but it &apos;s hard to me because it &apos;s also my art .
So I decided not to make art compromise to business ,
The whole character of this work is still in agreement .
But it &apos;s going to change because there &apos;s a trademark on the picture ,
people will think that this is a product
When you remove the logo , all kinds of explanations are likely to be _UNK_ .
This is the first three years ago
and she was in her wedding dress --
It &apos;s been used in _UNK_ and Charles &apos;s wedding recently .
This is Blair and _UNK_ . We need to be careful about legal issues .
This is obviously a big _UNK_ company , so we did this .
The _UNK_ Department Corporation made me design a series of windows .
I built a _UNK_ , creating some small scenes ,
This is Tony &apos;s reading and practice his speech .
I asked them to do _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ were together with his sex scandal .
because all of the press were published in the next day .
And this is the problem of _UNK_ the road .
because the police tried to _UNK_ the crowd
But it &apos;s really fun , and it &apos;s wonderful for me .
so that the picture is going to spread
_UNK_ , I gave my book a signature ,
And I &apos;m making my new book now .
in terms of the global market of _UNK_
My book was just about the British market .
I &apos;m from a background of _UNK_ humor ,
I think my work is understood to be humor .
And this is the most important way to deal with media .
How do we read information through the image .
because it just _UNK_ what is possible in private private lives .
This is probably what happens in the _UNK_ .
And then you take a shot of him ,
It &apos;s getting some _UNK_ , and maybe not so close to it .
Donald and Bush were laughing at the back of the _UNK_ picture .
This is the evaluation of the real events .
as we know about the prison that we know now .
based on the way we think about _UNK_
Jack _UNK_ , who was in his famous life ,
He actually had a little bit of a traffic _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s not easy to find these _UNK_ actors ,
So I was in the street with different people ,
to be involved in the photography of me .
to give them a chance that it &apos;s just like this ,
I was working with the Guardian in a form
Bush and _UNK_ are difficult to _UNK_ the Muslim culture ;
Tony Blair looks at _UNK_ , I think it &apos;s interesting .
I &apos;m just going to talk about this picture .
I made it a year ago , meaning had changed .
a horrible thing that happened to me .
before the fear was hidden in our minds .
And that &apos;s why it took a year ago
And I want you to look at these pieces .
whether it &apos;s private or government , it &apos;s all about cardiovascular disease .
And in Africa , the heart disease is the most _UNK_ disease ,
It &apos;s not supposed to exist , we have to change it .
the health of a country is proportional to the development level .
Every year a million people die of heart disease
Most of them live in developing countries , and in Africa ,
In developing countries , the global disease can _UNK_ heart disease .
And there &apos;s no such thing in the Western world
But 90 percent of the health resources are focused in the Western countries
not only do the people in Africa need to focus on
all of the people who are _UNK_ in Africa
If you go back to the bedroom at night ,
and suddenly feel a chest pain , no sweat , how to do it .
This is a heart attack , how do you deal with
in the United States , Germany and Europe ?
No one can do that . 50 percent of the people have died in 24 hours .
And I &apos;m going to show you a picture
When you &apos;re 50 years old , Nigeria estimated that Nigeria had become _UNK_ ,
is not because of the death of a child
but because when they &apos;re going to be able to
And they should be able to do this
The parents died , and the fastest way to poverty
that the child &apos;s life is going to die .
As you know , I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
_UNK_ , diabetes , obesity , lack of exercise , these are the most common _UNK_ .
In Tanzania , 30 percent of the people have hypertension
It &apos;s a great number of people who have lost their lives every year .
the hypertension is actually treated . Look at the situation of the people .
In the next eight years , AIDS and malaria
Please not repeat the _UNK_ policy of AIDS and malaria .
will be the major death disease in Africa .
We must remember this , we can &apos;t treat patients like this .
This is a typical African hospital . We can &apos;t expect the elite
They all left Africa , to the United States , Germany or Britain .
In the case of _UNK_ , the United States is _UNK_ ,
to solve the problems that are good enough
But my responsibility , I &apos;m going to try to deal with these problems .
And if they can help , of course , it &apos;s not going to reach me
Africa &apos;s lower health index and more people are focused on medical research .
You have to change , and we can &apos;t do it all the time .
If you can &apos;t do it , we have to find other useful ways
This is the problem that we have a headache ,
Everybody knows what &apos;s going on , but nobody knows how to treat it .
We decided to spend the money on the blade
And everyone was so excited about it .
I have a business in the United States
I lived in Tennessee , where the health care center of the United States
It &apos;s a very easy thing to do with health care .
We &apos;re going to do this business in Nigeria , and nobody &apos;s going to get it .
And the idea is that it &apos;s completely wrong , the audience ,
If you want to help Africa , it &apos;s going to continue investment
I &apos;m going to show you how the heart works a day .
to give you a sense of what we do .
And then I &apos;m going to talk about this .
And we &apos;ve built a country in the developing world
The center is now in 25 jobs , every single person
We have the _UNK_ Institute for _UNK_ ,
But it &apos;s only about the cost of _UNK_
10 percent of the United States in the U.S.
You can &apos;t afford to pay the ability to stop _UNK_ .
You have one dollar or two dollars , it &apos;s not going to work .
Let me tell you how this is going to work .
to make sure that the right device
Select a _UNK_ unit . Each unit can be _UNK_ .
It &apos;s got _UNK_ . It &apos;s easy to repair , so
And the instrument that we choose is _UNK_ .
We make sure that training is going to continue ,
In the future , we would have left , but unless
We find _UNK_ , we _UNK_ our _UNK_ , or we still have problems .
We make sure that the _UNK_ will be _UNK_
in the internal production , so it costs less .
250 dollars to buy a unit of radioactive drug .
And if you take two dollars , you know ,
And we realized that we had to _UNK_
How do we use technology ? How do we use technology ?
by _UNK_ the knowledge of our own health care
And we built the center of our medical care
And we decided to go ahead to Africa
in the middle of Nigeria , in Nigeria ,
We &apos;re going to build the _UNK_ Institute , which is going to be
In the next few months , we hope that _UNK_ will be able to operate
This pattern applies to every disease treatment process
all of the images can see in the _UNK_ .
We designed this remote medical solution , which is our patent .
We &apos;d like to share this with everybody else .
and also made them stay in profit at the same time .
You just have to click the mouse on it .
Now we &apos;re going to look at this whole process .
This is the heart Institute , doctors all over the world
I can call you in Switzerland , &quot; Please go to our system ,
Look at the diagnosis of Mrs. Jones and tell us your proposal . &quot;
and the message of these experts , the patient &apos;s treatment is more secure .
will not be because of the lack of experts
I &apos;m proud to tell you that in the United States , 80 percent of the health care methods don &apos;t take it .
And the technology that &apos;s going to work in the center
If _UNK_ had been _UNK_ , he could go to _UNK_
It &apos;s only two hours of _UNK_ ; if it &apos;s _UNK_ ,
can go to _UNK_ , but the people in Africa don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
And the cost of the meeting is that
We &apos;re going to expand our business into rural areas and allow local people to afford
and prevention is the solution that we stress .
but it &apos;s going to be the right thing .
You can tell the patient that it &apos;s going to be expensive
They need to live , and they need to support families .
We recommend movement because movement is the most effective , simplest way to prevent disease .
Every March and April are &quot; walking &quot; month .
We took the patient together to make them race .
to reduce the number of _UNK_ that will be reward .
and it &apos;s going to work with the kids .
the idea of exercise body prevention , once children have this idea ,
They will stick to exercise . They &apos;re going to do this .
These doctors are trained , and they have professional medical knowledge ,
We _UNK_ the lives of a very poor patient .
to give a heart _UNK_ . For those who know heart _UNK_ ,
If there &apos;s no heart , the patient will die .
because _UNK_ didn &apos;t have to fly to Atlanta
We were able to save _UNK_ dollars for _UNK_ .
At the end of this year , we were treated with poverty
has been invested in _UNK_ dollars . Four months ago ,
at the average month . The government couldn &apos;t give such a lot of effort
The government can only benefit to other needs . But we can support that .
And people said , &quot; How can you do that ? &quot; We &apos;re doing it .
at least 4,000 of the people in Miami
to admit that they &apos;re not going to go .
If they go to Miami , it costs _UNK_
Now eight to 10 times the same health level ,
And the amount of money that &apos;s saved is
you could have at least four _UNK_
But the key is that we have to follow this business
We &apos;re not satisfied with the situation , we &apos;re with
so that _UNK_ are trained in local training to get workers to repair their instruments .
we don &apos;t have to deal with the problem of machines .
We also did the training of _UNK_ medicine
and through the training of these kinds of training
because they were able to get a bachelor &apos;s degree
Now I want you to listen to this .
and our training students , how do we say
from the University of West University in _UNK_
because I have a _UNK_ and a _UNK_ course
for my training here to be sure
And I think it &apos;s going to be
_UNK_ and its attention in our actual application is increasing .
_UNK_ : I am a _UNK_ _UNK_ operator in the Caribbean Sea .
In the last two years , I &apos;ve been trained
and the training of this sort of thing
It &apos;s important to the diagnosis of heart disease .
But the key is that our training can work and continue
who say that poor people can &apos;t enjoy the best treatment .
I didn &apos;t decide , but my mission was to ensure everybody
and the same opportunity as rich and poor ,
the best way to get the best treatment
in the _UNK_ of Nigeria in Nigeria ,
to open a _UNK_ Institute for West Africa
And of course , the same research institution in other regions
Anyone who &apos;s interested in health care about healthcare
We are willing to help you and share our experience .
to help you achieve that . If you all work together ,
The level of health care in Africa will be _UNK_ .
Africa _UNK_ us , and it &apos;s time to turn us back .
And I thought , I &apos;m going to explain it
Some _UNK_ are so serious that they have never been talking about
But some _UNK_ eventually became a great scientist and engineers
There &apos;s one thing that makes me feel necessary to do .
is how to teach these kids to do this .
And as Mr. Gates talked about this morning ,
I &apos;d like to introduce you to a different way of thinking ,
Well , this is a test that you can take
the big letters or the small letter of _UNK_ .
And in fact , the ordinary brain is _UNK_ these details .
If you want to _UNK_ , that details are very important .
Because if you ignore the details , the bridge will be _UNK_ .
And one of the things I care about policy today
and I saw a lot of school _UNK_
I noticed that a lot of _UNK_ don &apos;t notice the details .
For instance , the flag was just set up in front of the _UNK_
These cattle are going to _UNK_ the entire _UNK_ .
And what they need is just the flag .
In the 1970s , when I began to do this ,
I &apos;ll go into the cave and see what the cattle can see from the hole .
People think I &apos;m an idiot . If there &apos;s a goats standing on the fence , _UNK_ .
The shadow will _UNK_ the cow , and there &apos;s a tap on the floor .
This is a wonderful show in the movie .
And my painting was showing _UNK_ in the film .
So , what do you think about ?
But I don &apos;t know anybody else is not thinking about it .
And then I began to write a book called &quot; The _UNK_ . &quot;
It &apos;s not the same way . For example ,
Most people think of it as a standard answer .
But for most places , it &apos;s all right to do .
and they would have my memory , like Google _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s a nice picture of the film , and it &apos;s got a lot of fun .
It &apos;s a nice picture of the film , and it &apos;s got a lot of fun .
It &apos;s a nice picture of the film , and it &apos;s got a lot of fun .
And I thought , maybe it &apos;s going to be snow .
and it &apos;s going to be frozen , and it becomes a film .
And this is not going to show the _UNK_ slides .
You can see yourself in YouTube , on YouTube ,
You can see yourself in YouTube , on YouTube ,
This is a _UNK_ that I saw in the film
There &apos;s a lot of other _UNK_ and _UNK_ types
And the film is showing a lot of people
But the thing that I &apos;m worried about is that
We &apos;re going to take this child to the direction
They &apos;re not taken to Silicon Valley -- that &apos;s where they belong to their world .
because I &apos;m not very good at social , one of the things I learned earlier
I &apos;m going to learn to sell my book , not my own .
I &apos;m going to show them , and they need to see these images
And the other thing I &apos;ve been good for is , in my little time ,
My parents told us that you can &apos;t afford
to take something on the shelf of the store .
When I saw four or four _UNK_ students ,
I can see that these kids are going to be visual _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve done this brain wave a few years ago .
I used to make a joke to someone else ,
The blue is the contrast of my gender and age .
This circle is often used to think about their main visual cortex .
But in fact , visual _UNK_ is just one of the mental models
_UNK_ patients often have a particular mind .
And I &apos;m going to try and figure out how bad it is .
But now it &apos;s a serious mistake . I found that some kids can skip algebra
Another mind is that the pattern of thinking
is just a piece of paper that folds .
And you can see the folds in the back ,
and it &apos;s a _UNK_ . These people know everything about everything .
I &apos;m going to wear this little phone today . I &apos;m not very comfortable .
to be able to adapt to it ,
And it &apos;s not going to reach my chin
some sensory stimuli are really a problem . Some children will be specific to _UNK_ .
and visual thinking gave me a whole new perspective .
You think about it . The animal is a _UNK_ .
You imagine how much information you have in the tube
You can see who has been there , when is there ,
They &apos;re not enemy , whether they have a pair of _UNK_ ,
In short , there will be a lot of information about _UNK_
a horse that was _UNK_ by a horse .
And there was a _UNK_ in front of _UNK_ , but they couldn &apos;t afford that horse .
If another horse had been given a _UNK_ ,
then the horse would be afraid of anything on the ground .
It &apos;s also afraid of _UNK_ , but you can ride it .
and on the ground , this is two things .
So , let &apos;s see how fine detail are here .
a lot of people are not going to be
and the people around me seem to see that it &apos;s a training problem .
or the problem of the equipment itself .
But I found that a lot of people didn &apos;t have this ,
For example , this is a problem of equipment .
So it &apos;s a little problem , and it &apos;s a simple tool to solve it ?
or the design of the whole system ?
I &apos;m going to have a special look at what ?
in the last 20 years there was a serious impact on aircraft crash
or the rear plane , or some control device in the rear compartment .
But the pilot didn &apos;t notice that there was an airplane
I would collect all the parts , and I _UNK_ them like a puzzle .
It &apos;s a horse that is really scared .
because it was once _UNK_ by a black _UNK_ .
In fact , the world needs to be
We have to grow a lot of different minds .
One of the things that makes me feel most _UNK_ .
I often go to some of the _UNK_ meetings
I see a lot of bright _UNK_ kids
And that makes me think of my scientific teacher
In the movie , my teacher &apos;s image is so beautiful .
And I was really _UNK_ when I was in school .
In _UNK_ , we need to bring those interesting things
I think there &apos;s a TED thing that might be done
That &apos;s how wonderful it is to tell all schools .
There are so many wonderful things on the Internet
because I was always in the _UNK_ and in other places
and see these very clever and bizarre kids
where the teacher doesn &apos;t know how to teach kids
so that every child becomes more _UNK_
and you can make kids more _UNK_ .
Now there are some studies on the _UNK_
more connected , just a little bit less social line .
Perhaps the two are the ones that are _UNK_ .
And if you go to the extreme ,
that person might be able to talk about it .
The language area is covered with visual areas , and the latter is as good as animals .
And the language area of these patients is _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ who worked in the car .
And the research shows that there are some
because I thought it would be possible to get a talk about _UNK_
I remember my school , the art is my favorite .
We must consider how many different types of minds are .
and to deal with them with their problems .
And although I was a _UNK_ , I didn &apos;t love learning .
But do you know ? I grew a lot of work in the classroom ?
I see a lot of clever kids today don &apos;t even have to learn .
when I was eight years old , I learned this .
And there was a _UNK_ in the grandmother .
It was a very small time to teach me
When I was 13 years old , I got a job in a _UNK_ factory .
and they learn to do their homework ,
When I was very small , I just wanted to draw a horse .
And mother said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s do something else . &quot;
The _UNK_ kids have to learn to do something else .
Let &apos;s teach kids to calculate the time of a _UNK_
is to inspire him . This is one of the things we have to do
And when I saw the teachers who were
-- especially when I go to those _UNK_ cities ,
-- the teacher doesn &apos;t know how to teach these kids
What can the vision do when they grow up ?
They can do images , they can do a lot of work with computers .
and the patterns that are going to be
And the _UNK_ and the kind of work
And there are words that they can be journalists
and you can also be an outstanding actor .
I need to learn how to get along with others .
And this is what I &apos;m going to learn .
We have to get the students to do this .
My scientific teacher is not a _UNK_ teacher .
Now the United States now has some rules
If you go to a degree of chemistry ,
you can teach life or chemical chemistry in _UNK_ .
that the good teachers are going to be
And we need to encourage some of these teachers to go to high school
And we have a lot of people who retire from software
They can teach kids how to do it .
and it &apos;s going to be very successful .
And even though they teach the content of _UNK_ ,
And the important thing is that they &apos;re opening a child &apos;s mind
The child knows that the world is so wonderful that they will be active to learn something new .
If your company is _UNK_ some of the companies
There &apos;s a _UNK_ kid who &apos;s going to do this ,
You &apos;re going to give them a specific job , don &apos;t say , give me a software
You &apos;re going to put the details of the needs
And thank you for all of the things
Remember you &apos;ve written that , and I love it .
We &apos;re still going to be in the cave .
_UNK_ : Who do you think is the first _UNK_ ?
is a _UNK_ man . If all the _UNK_ genes have disappeared .
CA : I &apos;d like to ask a couple of questions
_UNK_ : First of all , you have to look at age .
If it &apos;s two to four years old ,
And this is what it takes to decide
because the _UNK_ is also a different degree .
half of them may not speak to them .
They may not be able to work in Silicon Valley .
because it &apos;s not appropriate for them to them .
you have to be _UNK_ to their interests .
can ride with other kids and make a model with other kids .
in a rubber _UNK_ , put it on the _UNK_ , and we started to show our lights .
_UNK_ : If parents do that , the child becomes so _UNK_
If the house was burning , they would have saved you
CA : I was talking to a lot of people
And when I was _UNK_ , you know , the most passionate question
_UNK_ : I was very enthusiastic about what I did .
and hope that these things can make the world better .
And when I heard that my mother said ,
&quot; My child is now in college , thanks to your book ?
thanks to your lecture . &quot; This is my happiest moment .
In the &apos; 80s , I was working in _UNK_
I developed a very simple _UNK_ tool
only to calculate the output , like how many cattle have fallen .
and it &apos;s going to work a lot better .
We need more of these simple things .
CA : When we were talking to the phone ,
because you say you &apos;re passionate about _UNK_ . Can you say detail ?
_UNK_ : Because I knew that there was
and it &apos;s a very valuable thing to do
that the Internet was not going to grow a lot .
Every time I see somebody who &apos;s _UNK_ books ,
CA : _UNK_ , we had the fortune to invite you to TED , really happy .
We did not want to open _UNK_ and secrets .
But if you look at creative performance as a kind of research ,
or to think of art as a form of human development .
My _UNK_ is to combine digital technology and magic .
And these tools can help other artists ,
to go further in the way of art
What I &apos;m going to show you today is a piece of work
Would you be able to close the lights ? Thank you .
I think I &apos;d like to introduce people who create _UNK_ .
At the time they were _UNK_ in California ,
But I don &apos;t want you to do that .
And of course , they _UNK_ a _UNK_ and Caltech , and then ,
Hello , you go to the bed and you can do all the tests .
This is the first five employees that we have .
In fact , one of them is a _UNK_
And in the course of this _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The unfortunate thing is he _UNK_ himself on the day because he _UNK_ the explosive
The one side wants to figure out which is the best explosive .
_UNK_ who are the employees of the _UNK_ laboratory .
But it came out and thought it was too cold ,
So I &apos;m going to wear my shirt .
But the reason I showed this picture is that
to do something that is a different thing .
And this is the spirit of doing things .
There is a quote from _UNK_ , _UNK_ , poets ,
And one of my colleagues _UNK_ it on the wall of my office ,
and said , &quot; Don &apos;t go to those places that are _UNK_ , but leave your footprint . &quot;
and said , &quot; Don &apos;t go to those places that are _UNK_ , but leave your footprint . &quot;
and see what other people are doing ,
not just want to improve something else else ,
In the early years , we often work on rockets ,
But we often do some of the parties .
You see , this is a party that was a few years ago .
But 50 years ago , there was a _UNK_ thing ,
the Soviet Union launched . We launched the first American satellite ,
The picture on the left side of the satellite .
We went from a rocket research agency to a research institution .
And it &apos;s going to be done in a few years ,
And now we become the organization of _UNK_ ,
But even when we do things , we have to remind ourselves ,
You see , the rocket should fly up ,
I made a activity of a _UNK_ missile .
So , we &apos;re going to do an activity every year
The beauty competition , such as this kind of _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not right now . Somebody told me to do it .
I think it &apos;s not right to think about recently .
We do something more serious than we do .
And what you see is the last rose ,
The left is entertainment . The right side is ,
And the _UNK_ just did the experiment
It is ready to launch the _UNK_ of luck .
The _UNK_ on the graph is the one on Mars .
This is to tell you that our entertainment and business is _UNK_ .
This is to tell you that our entertainment and business is _UNK_ .
But I &apos;m going to play a clip
_UNK_ is one of our employees , giving you some kind of genius .
to deal with the sounds of the instrument ,
more abstract sound makes it more vivid ,
My job is half of music , _UNK_ is also the best .
I worked in the _UNK_ . I was involved in manufacturing _UNK_ .
I know some of the most _UNK_ engineers , also have art quality .
to do what you want to do .
If you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t listen to them .
Tell them to rest and do what you want to do .
_UNK_ : Now let &apos;s go away from entertainment , to the right business .
Why do we do these tasks , why do we explore them ?
And the reason I think is that it &apos;s very simple .
You &apos;ve heard of some of the origins of the universe over _UNK_ years ago .
You &apos;ve heard of some of the origins of the universe over _UNK_ years ago .
Or a lot of people imagine , from the Big Bang ,
until we have the beautiful world that we live .
You look outside : you have the beauty of what you have ,
There are intelligent people on the planet , as you know ,
All of this comes from the Big Bang . So the question is :
How did it occur ? How did the universe form ?
How do the galaxies form ? How do the planets form ?
Why is there a planet that evolved life ?
Can there be life on every planet around the stars ?
We are all made up of the _UNK_ .
We originated from stars and we are made of _UNK_ .
So the next time you &apos;re very depressed , the mirror
You can _UNK_ , _UNK_ , I &apos;m looking at a star .
So , what we &apos;re doing is actually writing things that are evolving .
So , what we &apos;re doing is actually writing things that are evolving .
The preferred , or most easy , we can go to Mars .
You know , only six months we can get there .
It takes six to nine months in the right year .
Mars is a planet like Earth . It &apos;s a little bit smaller ,
It &apos;s a very similar thing to the planet .
Mars is _UNK_ . It &apos;s the atmosphere , much smaller than the Earth ,
So there &apos;s weather change . Some aspects of the Earth are very similar
You can see the kind of terrain like this ,
or what we call the _UNK_ of Mars .
It &apos;s a big _UNK_ on the planet , but it &apos;s much bigger .
So , the size of the United States is so big .
There &apos;s _UNK_ on Mars . The _UNK_ on Mars ,
is a giant _UNK_ of volcanic _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to be a very high level
You can compare the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
Compared with the _UNK_ , there is a lot of _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ on the planet is much bigger than that .
_UNK_ activity and volcanic activity on the planet .
One of our recent satellite _UNK_ , like the decline in the earth .
One of our recent satellite _UNK_ , like the decline in the earth .
and it &apos;s still going to happen when we talk about it .
about _UNK_ , people want to know what they &apos;re doing now ,
So I &apos;m going to show you some of the _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ . The _UNK_ likes to _UNK_ ,
Because the _UNK_ is like the foundation to dig a _UNK_ .
There are a couple of football fields in the world .
If you look carefully , you &apos;ll see a little black spot .
I &apos;ll see you can see that this is on the surface of the earth .
This is from orbit , we can make cameras zoom in the surface ,
We can see the _UNK_ on the surface .
We actually _UNK_ the photographs of _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
and then you can start moving to a certain place .
And the reason is that many of you have been to _UNK_ ,
You can see a lot of _UNK_ in the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
These _UNK_ are the surface of a million years ago or 100 million years ago ,
You can extract the _UNK_ from the above .
If you look at these _UNK_ , it &apos;s like looking at this historical book ,
You can learn the events of the past history .
What you see is the formation of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s going to take a look at it ,
There are some difficulties in the _UNK_ plane like this .
If it &apos;s your words , you don &apos;t go directly .
We tested these _UNK_ or _UNK_ before we went down .
We tested these _UNK_ or _UNK_ before we went down .
I remember the last time I came to talk , and the _UNK_ just landed ,
And I remember when I landed 100 days
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m surprised
And four years later , they still run normal .
Now you &apos;re going to say Charles , you &apos;re talking about it ,
It &apos;s exactly the opposite . We really thought that _UNK_
only 90 to 100 days , because they &apos;re driven by solar energy ,
Mars is a dust planet , and we think
dust will accumulate on the surface of the solar cell ,
we don &apos;t have enough electricity , we can &apos;t survive .
I always say that intelligent is important ,
But it was a good thing to be lucky .
This is what we found . And then it &apos;s going to happen
The dust _UNK_ Mars , as you can see ,
The dust is _UNK_ by the net after the dust is _UNK_ .
like a new car , a new car ,
And that &apos;s why we &apos;ve lived for a long time .
But the dust _UNK_ for so many years
Now the two _UNK_ are kind of _UNK_ .
And one of them was stuck with a wheel ,
It &apos;s a front wheel , so we can only drive .
Another _UNK_ machine with a bit of rheumatoid arthritis ,
It &apos;s not so good that you walk like this ,
We can move the machine to the arm .
But they continue to provide a lot of scientific data .
And there &apos;s a lot of people in the entire run ,
is that people in the circle of science care about _UNK_ ,
I &apos;d like to put a video on the _UNK_ of science around me .
I &apos;d like to put a video on the _UNK_ of science around me .
and let me play the next video .
By the way , this video reflects the landing process four years ago .
In Houston , it was like this . It was very similar .
Now , if there &apos;s life , it &apos;s going to be found .
_UNK_ : I &apos;ll show you some beautiful things about Mars .
As I said , Mars is very similar to the Earth ,
And if I tell you these pictures ,
is a place in the Sahara , and you will believe
And one of the places is particularly fascinating to us
In northern Mars , close to the Arctic ,
Because we see the ice sheet , we see the ice cap
_UNK_ , like you see in northern Canada .
We wanted to find that we saw all kinds of glaciers .
the ingredients of the ice , what it contains .
We have a spaceship that are on Mars ,
It &apos;s called Phoenix , and it &apos;s 17 hours to land on Mars ,
We &apos;ll land another planet before the West Coast _UNK_ .
We &apos;ll land another planet before the West Coast _UNK_ .
As you can see , this is the _UNK_ of Mars ,
But I want you to miss the program for 17 days ,
Video : This is what we call terrorism for seven minutes .
The plan is to dig the soil and sample .
and put it in a stove and heating it .
It takes about seven minutes to go down to zero .
the soft land on the surface of Mars
Ben _UNK_ : The Phoenix is the first one .
is the first task to land near the Arctic , and the first time
is the first task to land near the Arctic , and the first time
will be connected to water on another planet .
Chris Anderson : At least on the planet , where the water is ,
where there &apos;s life , so there &apos;s a potential place
may have lived on Mars in the past .
_UNK_ : In the process of _UNK_ , the spaceship will be
The soft _UNK_ from the _UNK_ miles a short period of time .
The soft _UNK_ from the _UNK_ miles a short period of time .
The folded _UNK_ in the _UNK_ that I call _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : It looks like a cone - shaped egg .
_UNK_ : The front of the _UNK_ is _UNK_ ,
The heat insulation material is covered in the front ,
The lid will prevent the air - friction temperature when it enters the atmosphere .
The lid will prevent the air - friction temperature when it enters the atmosphere .
_UNK_ : The spacecraft will _UNK_ the air resistance to the atmosphere .
The air force _UNK_ in the air of the earth .
_UNK_ : From this point , we &apos;re going to slow down to 900 miles an hour .
_UNK_ : The temperature of the _UNK_ can reach the surface of the sun .
RG : The temperature of the heat _UNK_ can reach the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : If the parachute is too early , the parachute will be damaged .
The cloth and the _UNK_ will be _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : The opening of the parachute for 15 seconds ,
And then we don &apos;t need the _UNK_ to protect us into the atmosphere , so we _UNK_ them ,
And then we don &apos;t need the _UNK_ to protect us into the atmosphere , so we _UNK_ them ,
The first time _UNK_ to the atmosphere of Mars .
LC : The _UNK_ is broken and landed on the _UNK_ ,
The next step is that the radar system
_UNK_ : We lost the speed of turning into the atmosphere .
We &apos;re going to finish the goal 99 percent .
But at the end of the year , it &apos;s always _UNK_ .
When the parachute comes to the end of the day .
_UNK_ : At about a mile away from Mars , about 30 miles an hour , _UNK_ out .
_UNK_ : At about a mile away from Mars , about 30 miles an hour , _UNK_ out .
_UNK_ : And after the end of the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s a terrible moment , every condition in short time .
And the _UNK_ uses all the sensors
to make sure that it landed in the right place .
_UNK_ : Then the self - _UNK_ engine _UNK_ ,
and slowly slowed down until the safety landed .
_UNK_ : The distance between Earth and Mars is far away , need 10 minutes .
The signal on Mars is able to arrive at the earth .
The _UNK_ will be finished in seven minutes , drop and landed .
In fact , when we knew that _UNK_ started _UNK_ ( into falling and landed )
_UNK_ : The design of the spacecraft is very automated .
_UNK_ : The design of the spacecraft is very automated .
and then try to _UNK_ the surface of Mars .
and then try to _UNK_ the surface of Mars .
_UNK_ : hope that the process of landing is so successful as we see .
It &apos;s going to be a very nervous moment ,
We will see the spacecraft landed on another planet .
And then I &apos;m going to talk about our next step .
We are designing the next generation of _UNK_ .
We &apos;re designing the process of the next generation .
I &apos;m going to talk a little bit more about it ,
It &apos;s very similar to the design of new products .
We have to consider the temperature of the atmosphere .
So we have to study all kinds of different materials ,
We don &apos;t have to _UNK_ our customers in a hurry .
What we do is to make sure that design is a valid machine .
First of all , we ask our employees to have imagination .
We love to be close to the art center ,
Because in fact , we have a _UNK_ from the art Center ,
to design or design the room in our mission ,
So let people think about the freedom of thought .
We have a bunch of Lego toys .
Here &apos;s the _UNK_ of adults , and they sit down and play .
And then we &apos;re going to have a little bit more seriously ,
into a CAD , and all the engineers involved
Scientists , who understand the performance of the _UNK_ ,
to take all of this , and the team works .
In fact , the design of spacecraft in the computer ,
and see if it &apos;s in the need of us .
And we have to think about the environment of our target planet .
And we have to think about the environment of our target planet .
If you fly to Jupiter , there &apos;s a very high radiation ,
The strength of Jupiter is as high as the nuclear reaction .
Imagine you throw your PC into a nuclear reactor .
This is some of the little challenges we face .
to go into the atmosphere , we &apos;re going to test parachute .
You see the parachute in the video . It &apos;s a horrible day ,
If it happens , we need to test it ,
because we &apos;re going to open the parachute in the _UNK_ .
We open the parachute at the beginning of the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ . So we have to do all kinds of experiments .
To give you an intuitive impression that this is the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
Next step , we &apos;re going to actually build some models
and actually test them , in the lab of _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ them , they _UNK_ them , and they lose them ,
is to ensure that we are fully aware of the problems .
and then change the way it &apos;s going to be .
And then we actually did it and we did it .
This is the next generation , a small car size .
is to protect the heat fabric of the action .
It was basically built next year , and it was built ,
The next June will be launched next June .
In this case , this is a very large _UNK_ ,
I know , after the last talk , I know ,
Many people say the design of air bag is really cool .
But the new _UNK_ has doubled than the original ten times .
But the new _UNK_ has doubled than the original ten times .
So we don &apos;t use the bag . So we &apos;re using it .
Another novel thought that the land was going on .
We don &apos;t want it to go into the ground ,
We &apos;d like to let the _UNK_ go directly on the shelf .
In fact , _UNK_ suspended in 100 feet
and then you use the air to fly
to get the _UNK_ down to the surface .
hopefully run well , the _UNK_ will work in this way .
The _UNK_ is more like a chemist .
And when the _UNK_ were open around ,
It can analyze the chemical composition of the rock .
It will have a machine with the arm ,
put it in a stove and _UNK_ it .
If the _UNK_ were to go to place ,
If it &apos;s _UNK_ , we can use a small laser
to take part of the rock , the _UNK_ part ,
It &apos;s kind of like the World War , but it &apos;s really true .
At the same time , the service of society
You can play ads on Mars , we can train _UNK_
and I &apos;m going to work with these _UNK_ ,
It can give you an idea that we can do some interesting things on Mars .
I think I &apos;m going to go to &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
to show you some of the things we have .
There are two things that are going to be shown .
It has a beautiful ring of rings .
But for scientists , this ring has a special meaning ,
because we believe that they represent , a _UNK_ ,
Some scientists believe that the solar system is formed ,
when the sun was born in the sun ,
There &apos;s a lot of dust around it .
And then there are some things together ,
and then form big _UNK_ and forms the planets ,
The point is that we can see the _UNK_
to understand how our solar system is formed ,
First of all , let us go through the ring of Saturn .
So , all of these are really true .
the _UNK_ of the Earth &apos;s orbit around us .
You can see the details of Saturn &apos;s rings ,
Some of the particles that are _UNK_ together .
This is why Saturn is suspended because it has become _UNK_ ,
Now , you think that these rings are very large .
But thickness and paper is thin . It &apos;s very thin .
This is the shadow of Saturn on the ring .
there are thousands of miles around the world .
is going to have all kinds of satellites ,
every kind of _UNK_ , which is going to make
Scientists are busy for decades to explain these things ,
and then _UNK_ NASA that we need more money to explore
Why do these things grow like this , or why it &apos;s formed .
There are two satellites that are very interesting .
And this satellite is made of ice ,
from the orbit . It &apos;s made of ice .
Look at these _UNK_ , we call the _UNK_ ,
And when we go through them , we suddenly found
And the temperature goes up , and these are the _UNK_ .
And when we fly over the past , guess ,
This is the _UNK_ park of Saturn &apos;s _UNK_ .
We see the ice _UNK_ out of the planet .
And this shows that there &apos;s an ocean
Because of the power effect , we have these _UNK_
And I &apos;m showing you the distance here ,
A few months ago we had the spacecraft
so that we can actually measure the material .
40 miles high , because we worry about
And the risk is , but it &apos;s good for it .
The top of the spacecraft , we found a lot of
the organic matter , the ice out of the ice .
And a few years later , we will continue to _UNK_ the Saturn ,
We plan to get closer to the surface
Now one of the other satellites has attracted a lot of attention ,
And the reason for _UNK_ is that
It &apos;s a satellite that is bigger than our moon , it has the atmosphere .
The atmosphere density is almost as close as our atmosphere .
If you &apos;re on the _UNK_ , you feel the same pressure .
It &apos;s like the Earth . It &apos;s just a little cooler ,
methane is exciting because it &apos;s an organism ,
and people believe that the most beautiful thing
the origin of life , because it _UNK_ the organism .
It &apos;s like the Earth , and it &apos;s frozen .
So it &apos;s interesting to show you some examples
And we took a probe out of it ,
is developed by our European colleagues , _UNK_ a probe around _UNK_ .
We took a probe to the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
This is a picture of where we fall .
for me , like the shores of California .
you can see the river along the coast ,
And that white area is like a _UNK_ ,
through the _UNK_ device , a radar instrument ,
We found lakes , like the Great _UNK_ here ,
It looks like the river , the sea or the lakes ,
There &apos;s a cloud . We think there &apos;s a rainfall .
It &apos;s a very similar cycle of the Earth , but it &apos;s not
And there &apos;s a very cold , _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
These are the things that look like a liquid ,
The cycle of this planet is very similar to the Earth ,
but it &apos;s made of _UNK_ and methane and organic .
And if you &apos;re on the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
to the lake , and with the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
On the other hand , if you have a match ,
At the end , I &apos;d like to end with a couple of photographs .
is to ask you to think about it ,
This is a picture from the back of Saturn .
After Saturn , we call the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ Saturn rings . I put it in a big way .
I &apos;m not sure you can &apos;t see it ,
There &apos;s a _UNK_ , which is the Earth .
We can see our planet . I &apos;m going to zoom in
When you zoom in , you can see the Earth ,
in the middle . So we &apos;ve been _UNK_ to the art Center .
I was at the TED conference in Long Beach ,
We know that because we all know _UNK_ ,
One of the _UNK_ _UNK_ of the private sector .
And because we share the information of our genes ,
have a very rare _UNK_ DNA --
In fact , we all have a relationship with _UNK_ .
And of course , we have our own face books .
When I met _UNK_ at the next year ,
She online ordered us to have a happy _UNK_ T shirt .
What is the relationship between the future health ?
In fact , I met _UNK_ as a good example .
to influence our health and health care in the future --
to connect the Internet and the social network .
But if you think about it , if you have a _UNK_ leaf ,
How many of you think that one month ? We &apos;ll have a billion .
we &apos;ll see how this can affect the technology around us .
a lot of technology -- like a physicist and _UNK_ --
that affect our future health and health care ,
and talk about the major problems of health care today .
We don &apos;t really use the information very well ,
One of the things that we &apos;re talking about today
We spent most of the last 20 percent of our life .
in the health care system and ourselves ,
to move this curve to improve our health ,
So if you think about it , you &apos;ll see these technologies are really improving .
Imagine what the iPhone would be able to do .
The new establishment of medical school in _UNK_
There are hundreds of students around the world .
We studied these index technologies from medicine , biological technology ,
And the next few months is &quot; Future medicine , &quot;
A program that helps _UNK_ training and apply technology to medicine .
These phones have more applications than _UNK_ --
And from this point , there &apos;s a different kind of thing ,
that you can pass a little piece of chip on your iPhone .
I don &apos;t know if I do that , but it &apos;s really available .
to make them better aware of what you can do .
Now let &apos;s see how the index technology is health care .
We all know that based on Moore &apos;s Law , computers ,
So we can do more powerful things .
But I think the best place to compute
This technique can actually look at the interior
We &apos;re _UNK_ a lot of technology -- PET scans , CT scans ,
to find things that are different from different levels .
And today you &apos;re going to see a very high resolution scan ,
Now we can see the inside of the brain
with a kind of resolution and ability to do it ,
So we can understand _UNK_ , disease , and treatment .
We can look inside the _UNK_ -- in the brain .
by understanding the process and the connection ,
We can understand the effect of drug treatment or meditation .
_UNK_ have become more expensive and more portable .
from the explosion of this study of data
Today &apos;s scan takes about 800 books , or 20 GB .
This scan will be a _UNK_ or a book within a few years .
Let &apos;s analyze it from the case . I don &apos;t ask anybody to do it here ,
But if you &apos;ve been 50 years , it &apos;s time to have a _UNK_ .
How can you avoid the tip of the _UNK_ ?
compared with these two images , now as a _UNK_ ,
Oh , we may miss it , but in a _UNK_ ,
This may encourage people to check the _UNK_
This is an example of a fundamental change .
We went to _UNK_ medicine , information technology ,
_UNK_ , I think , is now moving phones -- digital medicine .
It was obvious that we were going to measure the time .
-- it was 100,000 _UNK_ or _UNK_ dollars --
It &apos;s about 5,000 dollars now , and I &apos;ll be able to do it .
a very powerful diagnostic device for us .
to combine this device and the electronic medical records --
In the United States , _UNK_ is still less than 20 percent .
In Holland I think this data will be more than _UNK_ .
But now we &apos;re going to _UNK_ medical data ,
Now , as a doctor , I can look at my patient &apos;s data
And of course , we are in the iPad , and even _UNK_ .
that are directly _UNK_ on these devices .
And as you see about a month ago ,
Two _UNK_ from the IBM &apos;s _UNK_ beat the _UNK_ .
So I want you to imagine that when we &apos;re in the next few years
when we really have artificial intelligence to use our brains
Now , in many cases you don &apos;t need to look at doctors .
Only about 20 percent of the cases really need to look at doctors .
And we &apos;re in this virtual age --
from a certain Skype video , &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot;
The _UNK_ developed a very complex health diagnosis system .
It is different to the communication between your health care doctors .
Now we can even be _UNK_ by these technologies .
This is my friend _UNK_ to my head ,
So she doesn &apos;t have to go to the emergency room -- I can look at it .
Or maybe we could use the game today ,
We &apos;re actually going to be able to diagnose patients --
If there is a full set of tools at home , these tools will help us communicate .
You can tell your friend of weight , and they can keep you up .
a whole set of technology is _UNK_ together .
So we don &apos;t use these _UNK_ devices , we can put them on a simple _UNK_ .
and Stanford colleagues invented _UNK_ _UNK_ --
It &apos;s much lower than the previous technology .
Now we are at the time of _UNK_ ourselves .
I can learn this data every day .
I can share these data with friends or doctors .
These watch can measure heart rhythm , which is called _UNK_ sleep ,
a whole set of tools that will benefit you .
we &apos;ll better understand what it does and how it works better .
Now there &apos;s a mirror that can measure your _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to say , in the future , we &apos;re going to have a _UNK_ device ,
like the _UNK_ system that we &apos;re using now ,
your red light will be bright -- it doesn &apos;t mean to check the engine .
and the lights are going to be careful .
And maybe a few years later , when you look at it ,
You would think that wireless _UNK_ will help you .
I think there &apos;s more information than you need .
Now we &apos;ve heard a lot of technology and connections ,
will make us feel better with the patient ,
actually promote the interaction between people and people ,
Now we have talked about the advances of patients in a way .
We are in the age of a surgeon
to work with robots , and now become reality ,
Now this technology is reinforced by multiple technologies .
The doctor can see the interior of the patient ,
where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .
For example , a physician in New York can help another physician in Amsterdam .
The _UNK_ of the robot can go through the _UNK_
And this is called _UNK_ , which is --
to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ --
in the cortex of the cortex of the brain ,
They can control a remote controller or a _UNK_ , eventually , a machine arm .
you can put more and more people in the body .
And although it &apos;s still in the clinical trials , but when we can connect these technologies ,
like _UNK_ and his colleagues designed the _UNK_ arm ,
to get rid of the people in the body
there are more flexible and control degree
We actually went into the _UNK_ of robots .
If you don &apos;t lose a limb -- for example , you have a stroke --
Or if you &apos;re a _UNK_ -- like I &apos;ve visited my colleagues in Berkeley --
I took this video last week . This is a _UNK_ .
It &apos;s the early days of _UNK_ robots .
And I think it &apos;s going to take this technology ,
This is _UNK_ , she lost her limbs in her childhood ,
Now they can move faster than we are .
It &apos;s obvious that obesity is going to _UNK_ the wrong direction ,
But this trend in medicine is reducing the index .
There are examples : we are now in the middle
When it helps you diagnose and treatment through your _UNK_ tract .
will eventually be automatically _UNK_ through your _UNK_ system .
to be able to do things that doctors can &apos;t do ,
So you don &apos;t need to train a _UNK_ to put them in .
They &apos;re going to be _UNK_ by your cell phone ,
You can go anywhere and get remote control .
This is a sample made by _UNK_ , smaller than a coin .
The function of an artificial retina is to focus on the _UNK_ .
Although still in early stages , there is a good prospects .
using blue tooth , wireless networks -- images to your eye .
to remind you how much heat is in your food .
to make _UNK_ use of their cell phones .
and put it back into the _UNK_ and do better diagnosis ?
like Steve Jobs made out of Stanford .
put it on a chip that can do thousands of tests
in any part of the world can do it .
to allow thousands of dollars to test the past .
If you go a little bit further on this little road ,
that we can design red cells for little time .
or a little robot to monitor our blood system or immune system ,
or even clear the _UNK_ in the artery .
In medicine , this cheap is not what we normally think ,
but it &apos;s 10 _UNK_ million dollars -- it &apos;s cheap .
when the first genome came in 10 years ago .
Maybe the next two years , 100 dollars of genome will occur .
What are we going to do with 100 dollars ?
We can do a million tests on the planet .
And that &apos;s when it gets interesting , when we start focusing on information resources .
We went into the real _UNK_ of medicine --
the right time for the right person to make the right medicine --
not as we now , give everyone the same drug --
A lot of different companies are using these things .
I &apos;ll give you a simple example , or from 23 .
My data shows that I &apos;ve reached the average risk coefficient .
But if I passed the same data to _UNK_ ,
For example , I can see I have two types of diabetes &apos;s risk index .
I have about two times the risk of 2 diabetes .
For example , I may want to see how many _UNK_ eat when lunch .
how my genes _UNK_ , what my drug does and what I need .
And when the person and the rest of the patients ,
So not only are genes , how many factors --
What time did the doctor ask you to live in the last time ?
_UNK_ : Where do you live , what do you have ?
All of the data _UNK_ us as individuals and doctors .
We &apos;re entering the medical system or the system of biology ,
and we can start to _UNK_ these information .
through these patterns , for example , in our blood ,
And we can see these little patterns ,
And the founder of this field , the way it works
We &apos;re going to predict ; we can know how we might be .
We can prevent ; this protective can be _UNK_ ;
And more importantly , it will become shared .
Microsoft or Google _UNK_ can manage the data ,
we will get better and more effective treatment .
We are often treated with the treatment of hypertension .
_UNK_ the blood vessels to regulate the blood pressure
This is a new device to do this treatment .
It should be able to launch the market within two years .
I have to say that most of our drugs are actually poison .
It may be the real cause of cancer recurrence .
If you think of cancer as a seed ,
It seems to be _UNK_ , but it is often _UNK_ again .
_UNK_ can be _UNK_ in a few months or a few years .
We now learned to identify the stem cells
As a identification target body , it has long - term treatment .
to take all of the data in the world ,
I &apos;ve been studying a lot about _UNK_ --
We have adult stem cells in our body .
We put these stem cells into a bone transplant .
In different subjects , especially in the _UNK_ .
We can see heart function improves and survival rate .
in the heart attack on our own bone marrow cells .
a mild way of collecting a bone marrow .
will be going to launch the market in two years .
It goes along the body curve of the patient ,
It needed 200 _UNK_ now to _UNK_ the next _UNK_ in local anesthesia .
If you think about every cell in your body has the same DNA ,
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ cell that can do
that could be treated with multiple organs in the same patient --
I think this will be the new era of your cell _UNK_ .
put your own cardiac cells in the _UNK_ ,
when you want them to be used in the future .
We now integrated these techniques as a whole cell engineering era .
This is the future ; it &apos;s still in the initial stages .
Recently , when you think about the trend of technology ,
If we can start thinking about how to understand and use these technologies ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Because as a doctor , if someone finds me in the early days ,
But it &apos;s often too late , like cancer 3 times or 4 stages .
As a cancer doctor , I look forward to unemployment .
Your brain can be divided into two parts .
In _UNK_ , the main aspect of rational ,
If we measured the ability of brain hemisphere ,
For example , this says someone is completely rational .
where are you going to put your brain on the line ?
Some people might choose a very extreme situation ,
But I think most of the people in the audience
Two brain hemisphere have a high potential at the same time .
And I was a guy who was a guy
and most of the other experiments of quantum physicists ,
But at the same time we need a good instinct
How do we improve this _UNK_ ? Well , we like to study things .
We &apos;ve been studying and _UNK_ , and we &apos;ll see how it react .
as a thing can only appear at the same time .
I mean , it &apos;s weird to think about a thing .
and there are two different places in the same place ,
But you &apos;re not naturally in this concept , you &apos;re the nurture of tomorrow .
I remember seeing a kid playing on the _UNK_ .
He &apos;s just a _UNK_ and he &apos;s not good at the kid , he &apos;s asleep .
But I bet and _UNK_ had a very valuable lesson
is that big objects don &apos;t allow you to move through ,
And this is a model of the world ,
And this is a bad model for particle physicists ,
They think they &apos;re doing all kinds of weird things --
Or they can also appear in two places at the same time .
They &apos;re using the theory of quantum mechanics .
This is the frontier of physics a few years ago ,
Maybe it &apos;s because I &apos;m not going to study the particles .
but it doesn &apos;t fit with my logic .
Because if all things are made of particles ,
So I know better about _UNK_ things .
Before a long time , I started to work .
And in the middle you can see the _UNK_ .
That &apos;s the metal that I &apos;m going to talk about .
focused a little bit . We see the point in the center .
This is a very near , very close to the _UNK_ .
What we see is a little piece of metal ,
Its shape is like a diving board , and it _UNK_ at the end .
The same way is to make the metal .
I &apos;m working on a single silicon chip in the _UNK_ room ,
And then I went on to about 100 hours in all these big machines .
And in the end , I had to make my own machine --
but it needs some help to do that .
Do you know how _UNK_ is in a crowded lift ?
I mean , when I was in the elevator , I could do all kinds of weird things ,
_UNK_ the heat in the space of its _UNK_ .
So , if we want to see it ,
We &apos;ll have to _UNK_ all the other passengers .
And then we put it in a vacuum and took all the air ,
to a little bit more than the absolute zero .
_UNK_ can do whatever it wants to do .
We found it in a very weird way .
It was _UNK_ , rather than totally static .
And the way it _UNK_ is like this --
What I &apos;m here to tell you is some amazing things .
And all the atoms that are forming _UNK_
Only in a certain time they are in agreement .
And at the same time , in two different places ,
So let me show you a little bit more
What I &apos;ve done for these years is worth _UNK_ .
and the difference between the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
So if a single atomic energy is in a different position ,
And that _UNK_ can be in a different position ,
I mean , this is just my rational thinking logic .
And think that if you can sit in a lot of places at the same time ,
and open the light into the box ,
We see _UNK_ still just a piece of paper .
So I had to form a new instinct ,
It seems that all the objects in the lift
about how the physics of quantum physics is connected .
And here , I &apos;m going to read some of the things
And I was surprised by the _UNK_ of this theme
In _UNK_ , his grandmother was surprised to his profession
My grandmother _UNK_ my mouth with soap .
Two narrow rooms , a _UNK_ kitchen , all her apartments
until now , she was always sad and _UNK_ .
When I wake up every morning , I heard the first time
and he had a car with milk on the way .
And the sound of the night seems to have been
And my father was driving a car to the _UNK_
He went into the cellar and went to the stove .
The _UNK_ _UNK_ , and the _UNK_ went out .
and then you go to bed and go to bed .
to wear a cotton _UNK_ at night .
And when they look at the kids ,
or to go shopping in the grocery store .
and they &apos;ve never been able to do it .
that men have already known to do for them .
And once , the animal is a _UNK_ .
Or a game , a game that _UNK_ your friend &apos;s back .
to communicate , to fight , is the code of feelings .
your cheek is _UNK_ by your father &apos;s _UNK_ beard .
you will _UNK_ another person and _UNK_ it for a while .
And although we were alert -- it seemed so bold
In the jungle , like _UNK_ the _UNK_ beast .
is the right thing to do right now .
and kept _UNK_ my window in the house .
Her shadow _UNK_ her with the sound of _UNK_ .
that only calls and music -- jazz --
because it filters and goes into the hall at night .
And this was the life of Chris _UNK_ --
My first love , who -- until I left her --
In my shoulder , my shoulder was _UNK_ in my _UNK_ ,
because I was so young that I believed her pain .
I guess she &apos;s going to end up with this love ,
I guess she &apos;s going to end up with this love ,
a man called , &quot; _UNK_ ! &quot; _UNK_ dog ,
And when she saw me at the party ,
The other one is about the _UNK_ of youth and the years .
When the blue hair is waiting for the doctor ,
And so she can see that she &apos;s really _UNK_ .
It was a nice coincidence . It was an hour ago ,
And every time he had the responsibility to push it ,
I &apos;m not at least part of my _UNK_ ,
And the fact is that he &apos;s going to jump
I don &apos;t know if I want to play him or become him .
It &apos;s a city poem that I &apos;ll read at a picnic , maybe not .
I was getting along with a woman and a half years
I was scared . I felt like a kid .
and I &apos;ll be able to get out of control , and I &apos;m always going to have a bag
And sometimes , I want to take her home ,
She won &apos;t do me , and I believe it .
This is the first one , a new one .
And she was the _UNK_ of the class ,
This will not even open if it &apos;s winter ,
If it &apos;s winter someone has closed it . &quot;
It was actually a split and let yourself fall .
Never thought about it , _UNK_ is now hard to think about it .
Or if it &apos;s not her , she &apos;s not completely ,
But self noticed that my will be to themselves .
I &apos;m going to read the first one , not my habits .
But I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to go to this .
If I &apos;m not the wish of a initial state .
and led to some girls who were _UNK_
because there &apos;s a _UNK_ version of it .
in the show . The men and women were dressed up ,
waiting for a film to be thrown in a channel .
And she died in camp and she died --
But it &apos;s like sex , and you haven &apos;t been told .
So , now I realized that death was going to me ,
I live in my life as if I &apos;m a _UNK_ .
And I mean , the world has _UNK_ me
She was a _UNK_ hot , her chest ,
But we also know that when the _UNK_ started ,
I &apos;m going to be surprised by this .
We &apos;ve never seen our planet in this point .
thanks to the people who are in the room
And then we started to take this action .
These _UNK_ are _UNK_ , and you may also say they are nailed to the cross .
the earthquake of _UNK_ , the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
or how much compassion is going to be .
that led to the _UNK_ of Iraq ,
The _UNK_ of the United States is called the moral _UNK_ .
The victims of the war were killed by _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The students who were beaten by the police forces .
And especially in the issue of AIDS ,
In the early 1980s , all kinds of diseases
In 1987 , one of the most famous women in the world , made a simple thing ,
This action has been _UNK_ , especially in Europe .
She is much more clear than most people .
And when we face a photograph of influence ,
We can see it elsewhere , or we can make it know more about it .
People began to look at it , and eventually to the victims of _UNK_ ,
And the picture is always going to let us know
that the Americans don &apos;t want to go to the pictures
because it &apos;s too _UNK_ to be open .
And this is the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
This unusual work has never been published , it &apos;s called &quot; The war is everybody . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t necessarily have to be so true .
_UNK_ took the photograph of the _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
is to make me feel very _UNK_ .
_UNK_ said , but I don &apos;t agree to him ,
In my opinion , the creation is not a photographer ,
And so , we _UNK_ with this picture .
There was a half and a half beautiful _UNK_ floor ,
-- thank you -- I think this is because --
This is a test of the human limit .
I &apos;ve got all the food that I need ,
and a _UNK_ _UNK_ -- these are the three months
And in the last 16 minutes , what we &apos;re going to do ,
is trying to answer three questions . The first one : why ?
How do you _UNK_ under the conditions of 40 degrees below .
that exposed skin to the _UNK_ , so how do you answer it ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to answer this question now and wait for the final time .
Number three : What do you do ? What &apos;s the next challenge ?
My first expedition was a _UNK_ with a _UNK_ .
And we want to think about it --
And the most fascinating thing about the Arctic ,
It &apos;s exactly the _UNK_ of the Arctic Ocean .
And to that point , you have to really _UNK_
the ice that &apos;s floating on the Arctic Ocean .
and a lot of books , a map and chart .
but in the first morning in the morning ,
I was 23 years old . And my peers
We were _UNK_ by a polar attack on the next day .
We don &apos;t have any food . hunger has reduced our weight .
And the weather was very unusual at the time ,
There is no money to buy satellite phone , so we only have high - frequency radio .
You can see two ski _UNK_ coming out of the tent .
and the rest of the world is talking about time .
We &apos;re 400 miles away from the Arctic ,
We don &apos;t have time to get 200 miles away .
It &apos;s coming in the summer , and the ice starts to melt ,
We &apos;re talking to the Russian _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
They said , &quot; Look at the _UNK_ , you don &apos;t have enough time .
There was such dreams that I could not even have a shadow .
In that journey , every journey becomes tough ,
I &apos;m going to play two shots in my mind ,
to encourage me to move forward and move .
out of the helicopter , the rock _UNK_ in the background ,
I _UNK_ the British flag , you know , the _UNK_ wave .
I can even see myself on the Arctic , you know ,
It was a glorious moment , with the background _UNK_ was going to _UNK_ .
I think I &apos;ll get to the airport right now ,
I &apos;m going to come to my book and write a book .
We don &apos;t go to the Arctic and we don &apos;t have enough money .
There &apos;s no money to go for someone , no one .
And when I went back to _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
I _UNK_ , they were all there , and my grandfather had the British flag , _UNK_ .
And so , I went back to my mother .
and it &apos;s got to pay for a _UNK_ debt .
My elder brother sent me a text message .
is from &quot; The _UNK_ , &quot; said , &quot;
Three years of _UNK_ , I eventually got up from the sofa ,
I &apos;m going to go straight through the _UNK_
to the _UNK_ in the middle of the map ,
No one _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the Arctic Ocean .
Two _UNK_ had finished in 2000 , but no one could pass alone .
So , this is probably why I &apos;m going to try
But I know that the safe home is not easy ,
And one of the most amazing _UNK_ in the world
It &apos;s going to happen . We &apos;re flying to Moscow .
The next road , we rented a Russian _UNK_ ,
to go to a town called _UNK_ ,
That should be the last part of the _UNK_ .
And our photographer , a good condition of being able to fly
And before the plane ran to ask the pilot , we had to fly ,
And the Russian pilots had no expression to answer ,
_UNK_ , _UNK_ is not the end of the world ,
We were just ready to stay for a night . The end was there ten days .
The reason is that the payment of _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
between the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ in the helicopter ,
In the end of the morning , we solved all the problems .
put things in a _UNK_ . Two _UNK_ fly together
_UNK_ the ice , and I &apos;ll put it down there .
We took a wonderful 45 minutes of film ,
and all the other people on the helicopter ,
Now I don &apos;t know whether the text can _UNK_ the moment .
And I was a little _UNK_ at the time ,
And even worse , you can see this _UNK_ ,
The _UNK_ on the screen ; that is the full moon .
because we had been delayed in Russia , of course ,
the biggest or the _UNK_ of the moon ;
When you stand on the surface of the frozen ocean ,
The interesting thing is going to happen -- the _UNK_ will move .
I was seeing you at the time , two _UNK_ are _UNK_ .
95 days of food and fuel are _UNK_ ,
When the _UNK_ is not the level , I wish it was not .
I can just pull a little bit first and then pull back another one .
from the wind , the tide and the sea pressure .
NASA described the ice last year as the worst of the record .
and the ice is always going to flow .
I went on the road for nine weeks .
Most of the time I was moved back to the ice ,
I got up in the morning , and I went down to seven and a half hours ,
And the tent , and found out where it started ,
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ , I &apos;m pushing forward to the _UNK_ speed of ice .
I was in the tent and ready to leave .
In the late 1960 s , ice is no longer a problem .
because there is no ice -- the open water .
I would expect it to happen . I know the North Pole .
I have imagined that there will be open water , so I &apos;m ready to secret weapons .
The polar bear knows only to go forward on the Arctic Ocean .
If they meet the water , they will go ahead .
So we designed a diving suit -- we worked with Norway --
And I walked into my coat and it _UNK_ my boots ,
And _UNK_ up my face , with a tightly _UNK_ on the face .
If I go away , it &apos;s not going to be the end of the world .
And that means that even if it &apos;s the worst thing .
There &apos;s a guy -- one of his players , Thomas _UNK_ --
Well , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ . This is my little wireless phone ,
The wireless telescope is a digital camera in my pocket .
And every day in my 72 days in the Arctic ,
to send the information that I walk through --
We communicate with the world for less than two hours .
In this case , it was called the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
When the fog comes , the clouds fall down , the wind _UNK_ .
visibility is low . You can see it . There &apos;s a yellow one here .
In short , the curious combination of high tech and raw methods .
I got to the point of the _UNK_ May .
From Russia , I spent 68 days here ,
It &apos;s not even a _UNK_ point . There &apos;s nothing .
There &apos;s a flag here , and it &apos;s going to move into Canada or Canada .
And the strange thing is that there &apos;s actually a warmer side there ,
It &apos;s certainly inspired by the power of itself ,
I &apos;m going to go from Canada in the Arctic ,
And the only evidence that I got there
This is my non - clear GPS picture , the _UNK_ location device .
There &apos;s a 9 / 11 there &apos;s a string of 0 .
_UNK_ -- suddenly it was the North Pole .
I sat down on my _UNK_ and gave GPS a _UNK_ .
I took a few weeks . I took out the satellite phone .
_UNK_ a girl friend , and he hit a president of the _UNK_ .
I finally _UNK_ her mother &apos;s phone and she &apos;s in line .
She began to cry and let me go to her later .
I ran over the slide for a week .
I think that before the worse I can &apos;t go forward ,
This is the last day I was on the ice .
When I was talking to my management team ,
And they said , &quot; Look , this , it &apos;s getting worse .
There is a lot of open water in your south .
I never tried to find a plane . Tony _UNK_ , who said ,
&quot; This is , you have to find 500 meters long .
This is the only little _UNK_ I can find --
And it took me 36 hours to go and find --
It &apos;s full of _UNK_ . I can measure my _UNK_ .
I didn &apos;t tell Tony that I didn &apos;t tell the pilots .
It &apos;s just a nice thing to land --
I &apos;m kind of afraid it &apos;s not going to try to land .
The pilot , I know , is called _UNK_ . I want to call the _UNK_ .
It should be a _UNK_ to do this business .
It was an amazing moment when I landed on the plane .
And then I thought , at least , I should be calm and _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
I should keep the _UNK_ image of the tough .
The plane went to me and went to the place .
Open the door . He jumps down to my shoulder . He said , &quot; You know , I &apos;m a good name . &quot;
She sat there in the _UNK_ of her hand .
They were the most _UNK_ person I met , but they made me happy that day .
_UNK_ up the ladder , he said , &quot; You sit on the side . &quot;
He lost his cigarette , and first flew into the front ,
And after a couple of times over the _UNK_ ,
just to get some _UNK_ . And he said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to --
I &apos;m going to take off . &quot; And then he --
I later learned that this was a very ordinary movement , but I looked at _UNK_ .
You can see the engine is actually at the top of the _UNK_ .
is that little _UNK_ in that place . He put his hand on the motor .
_UNK_ was very gentle in the hand of his hand .
I thought , &quot; Oh God , _UNK_ . We all _UNK_ . &quot;
The plane is moving forward . The _UNK_ is just ready to take off .
At the end of the _UNK_ , a _UNK_ had just been _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
I can see the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ is working hard ,
And he released a hand , the back of the _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ a _UNK_ switch on the _UNK_ , ( pause )
It &apos;s a _UNK_ that you can see on the wall .
I finally saw the whole situation in the air .
Of course , when you &apos;re on ice , you can only see a obstacles .
It &apos;s not a pressure _UNK_ is a little water .
This may be why the length of the track does not give me a problem .
I mean , the ice is really starting to break .
Why ? I &apos;m not a traditional _UNK_ in the Arctic ?
There is a big scientific search base in the Antarctic . There is a _UNK_ .
and the limits of technology . That &apos;s what I &apos;m interested in .
And for me , this is also a personal potential .
For me , this is the opportunity to explore the limit --
to drive my own potential to see how long it is .
And in a larger scale , I was fascinated by people
In a larger sense , I &apos;d like to take this trip
to realize that every one of us has just a little bit of time on this planet
This is the best summary I can get .
The next question is , how can it be at 40 degrees below ?
The answer is , of course , a business secret --
If I had the last minute , I would say some details about the second question .
And that was the heart of the Antarctic .
If you go to the shore , you can see the ice _UNK_ --
Here , the _UNK_ below -- the ice _UNK_ is very similar to French _UNK_ .
is twice the size of Australia -- a big place .
who was the first competitor to the South Pole ,
_UNK_ was _UNK_ -- he had _UNK_ and _UNK_ --
A couple of dogs , the _UNK_ of the equipment ,
The _UNK_ and his four players finally _UNK_ on foot .
There was a tent , a letter to the king of Norway .
and they turn over and down to the coast ,
The five people died on the way back .
That &apos;s what happened before _UNK_ -- from then , no one went again .
from the coast of Antarctica to the point and return .
every one of you heard about the South Pole .
It &apos;s not a car when it comes back ,
The dog _UNK_ , or a kite to go through --
No one tried to _UNK_ . So this is my plan .
And before I go to the end , what I &apos;d like to say is --
I had a -- I &apos;d like to have this scan down --
I have a school report . I &apos;m 13 years old .
Now this behavior report on my desk , the _UNK_ frame .
I think if I learned what I learned from this , that &apos;s , no other people .
Only yourself can decide how far you can go , you have a lot of power .
I &apos;ve been in hospital for a long time ago .
After a few years of discharge , I was _UNK_ .
and the director of the burn department came to me --
I &apos;m going to give you a new kind of wonderful treatment . &quot;
I walked into his office with a _UNK_ mood .
When I _UNK_ , he gave me a specific explanation
I have some little _UNK_ on the left .
I had a serious burn so I didn &apos;t have a hair beard .
And the idea was that he was going to take my beard
to tell me that this is a strange way
And I think my way of doing this
will _UNK_ into a _UNK_ way --
because I have to guarantee the same width
I asked , &quot; Can you give me a sample ? &quot;
I asked , &quot; What do I do after my old hair ? &quot;
and say , &quot; What do you think ? I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
And then it became the biggest confession in my life .
This is a big thing for a _UNK_ .
Do you have this kind of _UNK_ hobby ?
and a lot of the things I decided to do --
I &apos;ve never been able to do that .
I found his assistant , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
He explained that they had been treated in two patients
They need a third patient to finish their report .
Now you might think that this guy was an idiot ,
But I &apos;m going to show you a different perspective .
I did a series of experiments in my lab a few years ago ,
We often hope that _UNK_ will be able to behave differently .
So we have a lot of hope for _UNK_ .
We expect to be lower than the control group .
We expect to be lower than the control group .
We expect to be lower than the control group .
He was about 20 years old than everyone else in the group .
And I remember the old man in _UNK_
And I remember the old man in _UNK_
We said , &quot; What if this man doesn &apos;t happen in _UNK_ ?
We said , &quot; What if this man doesn &apos;t happen in _UNK_ ?
We said , &quot; What if this man doesn &apos;t happen in _UNK_ ?
we might say , &quot; Well , how can this guy be doing so bad ? &quot;
because he took the average part of the group
and it makes us more _UNK_ and more
So we decided not to _UNK_ the person out .
And there &apos;s a lot of other things that we &apos;ve done
The first point is that we will meet a lot of people
They stimulated themselves to avoid the reality of reality .
And I &apos;m sure some of the things we all know .
And of course , the hardest thing is to recognize
This is a very difficult course of course .
because we can &apos;t see the interests of ourselves
to get the real data patterns to be _UNK_ .
I was actually struck by a lot of positive consciousness
I think the real challenge is to recognize
and try not to believe their intuition to overcome this challenge .
to prevent ourselves from being able to become _UNK_ .
I really want to leave you with a positive idea
I mean , this is really a _UNK_ --
We don &apos;t see any of the things that people don &apos;t think about .
And these positive ideas that I think are
is that if we know that we &apos;re wrong ,
And I think that &apos;s what I want to thank you .
I &apos;m curious to give you a hand , who agreed to this sentence ?
And this is actually a pandemic called _UNK_ .
She has been studying HIV for 15 years ,
Some people actually do it because they do HIV ,
Now you put a public health _UNK_ glasses ,
you know that if you give people the necessary information ,
and tell them what they &apos;re good for them , what &apos;s bad ,
to make them respond to the above ,
But for people like me to study HIV , a little bit of trouble ,
So , we &apos;re going to talk about what _UNK_ thinks .
I used to talk to a friend of Indonesia , a friend of _UNK_ .
And we had lunch , and he told me
He took drugs in the island of _UNK_ .
It was a birthday day that they _UNK_ some heroin .
and I &apos;m just going to use my clothes ,
I saw _UNK_ getting closer to me ,
I was thinking about it in my head ,
And you know , he couldn &apos;t get a little wrong ,
was a _UNK_ and he was in jail .
or to accept that full _UNK_ or can &apos;t make any fun .
And if you really have anything you really want to do ,
I &apos;m not going to use _UNK_ stories as a data ,
We asked them , &quot; Do you know how you infected HIV ? &quot;
I mean , almost 100 percent , right , it &apos;s all _UNK_ .
And we said , &quot; You know where you can buy
Is it nice to be nice and inexpensive ? &quot;
&quot; We take drugs , we know where to go . &quot;
The _UNK_ are _UNK_ together to make poison .
Why ? Is it common to make you more _UNK_ ?
We asked them , and they said , &quot; You &apos;re mad ?
You don &apos;t want to share with someone else , like you never have a _UNK_ ,
Even if he is your lover , it &apos;s not .
No , no . We &apos;re using _UNK_ because we don &apos;t want to go to jail . &quot;
If you were _UNK_ , you would be caught by the police ,
is that it &apos;s not good to keep HIV in danger ,
Now we look at the problem from the policy _UNK_ .
and the people in the country are doing
Other countries competing , Australia , Holland and a small part of the country ,
In these countries , you can see that
In _UNK_ , there is no country in this policy , like New York City ,
And she had to be treated for diseases
In the United States , what we &apos;ve been doing
and _UNK_ the data and _UNK_ it up .
The _UNK_ Project is the effective thing to do .
In _UNK_ , these results show that _UNK_ plans are not valid .
And you think that on this fabulous slide ,
I &apos;m going to show you the rest of the data ,
It &apos;s just , _UNK_ , it &apos;s not a rational thing ,
And what they did was they thought to do it .
and don &apos;t want to respond to this .
It was thought that if you were free ,
But the _UNK_ , you see , I &apos;m going to say _UNK_ .
whether it depends on the blood and the _UNK_ fluid ,
_UNK_ people were infected with HIV , and they were infected
And then , after a while of the time ,
for 10 years or 12 years , the virus remains at a very low level ,
If you have an infection with other people , you have _UNK_ ,
when the virus in your body gets _UNK_ ,
because that means you have to talk about
And it &apos;s a great thing to _UNK_ sex ,
Some people tend to be more inclined to
There &apos;s a lot of partner in the _UNK_ ,
are selling _UNK_ , and there are more partner ,
Most of these countries are in the east of Africa .
These are all reflected in the current range of popular diseases .
and basically the average mass of the public ,
the _UNK_ ratios in the high risk groups ,
You notice the local data in San Francisco .
Of course , if the sexual intercourse of non - _UNK_ will not _UNK_ HIV .
In most countries , the trade industry in most countries
is because of the _UNK_ that are encouraged .
because you have a disease that affects the business .
And there is no client who wants to go home .
to the full _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
or you want to develop the person who is _UNK_ or mate ,
Now he &apos;s probably not going to have sex ,
And this is in _UNK_ and reminds you
Why do you want to go to bed ?
This is why we call the _UNK_ effect .
Some people say , &quot; This is not important .
So if you look at the infection of the virus ,
But what &apos;s more than that ? If you don &apos;t accept treatment ?
These green parts , including the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
because you don &apos;t have to go to the doctor
Or you don &apos;t have drugs , or you go to the party ,
or your body starts getting resistance , or whatever else ,
And I mean , _UNK_ , how many great _UNK_ are ,
We must try to get more people to accept _UNK_ treatment .
But I &apos;m going to talk about a problem
for 15 years in the treatment of AIDS in the developed world ,
And we can go there in those countries .
After treatment , the _UNK_ of _UNK_ began to decline .
The virus is very low , so I &apos;m safe . &quot;
And the other reason is that people are essentially
the same kind of _UNK_ , the same thing ,
Look at the data , we &apos;re going to discover
Whatever it is , most of it is _UNK_ .
In the beginning of the treatment , there was no situation ,
And that means that people don &apos;t fear that anymore .
On the other hand , the number of the virus increases ,
It means that the better way of medical treatment , we have to _UNK_ our efforts .
We often talk about compassion in two days .
to provide family health services for the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s hard to give the drug a _UNK_ ,
or a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ , or a _UNK_ ,
for them to buy expensive drugs until they end their life .
I &apos;d like to say a few words about _UNK_ .
_UNK_ was _UNK_ , and she was in the streets of _UNK_ .
There &apos;s no option , and so on , and so on ,
But if we teach her to sew up
She offers a good job in the factory and things will be happy .
In Indonesia , the factory average an hour
And this is the data on the slide .
It &apos;s not a good job , but it &apos;s good for everyone .
We also have a way of knowledge , knowledge , cash ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ : &quot; When political steps , everything becomes so _UNK_ . &quot;
and look at it in a very different way ,
and look at it from the public health _UNK_ ,
Everybody has a logical set of logic .
how many of the people in the world
This is one of the _UNK_ moments of humanity .
because a stupid decision in the politicians ,
And of course , not only are we , but TED is a leading person ,
Every one of these videos on the website ,
is that there &apos;s a commitment to the _UNK_
As a journalist at _UNK_ , I saw it .
And I reported another war -- Iraq war .
I was transferred to the center of the war ,
is that we can be able to live in life
This change is not from foreign interference ,
_UNK_ said , yes , they _UNK_ the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
&quot; Do you want to see the status of Iraq ?
Do you want to see civil war and civil war ?
Do you want to see the foreign army in your land ? &quot;
that live under the existing regime of life
This is one of the most terrifying nightmare we have .
And in the Arab world , you know ,
Let &apos;s get the right to express the _UNK_ in the street .
_UNK_ : &quot; We want this regime to come back . &quot;
people are stimulated by _UNK_ around the streets .
And they were surprised at the time
This is what they say , it &apos;s a conspiracy .
This is the origin of the _UNK_ change .
But we found that people in the streets
to collect all kinds of information from common people --
They united together , and they have _UNK_ ,
We &apos;re going to be the _UNK_ of these people .
And the reason for this is that we have a lot of problems
And the _UNK_ News _UNK_ got the voice of the public .
We let this sound spread through every home in the Arab world .
you &apos;ll see a lot of other countries that want to see
This is because they think it &apos;s not in their culture .
And the time that the Arab world had changed ,
This is the right moment , the _UNK_ moment
And we see these important _UNK_ of each other .
a _UNK_ who I don &apos;t know -- from the _UNK_ square ,
We should give up ideas -- especially Western countries --
And now it &apos;s moving through the Middle East ,
for the people in the land that are _UNK_ .
Chris Anderson : I have a couple of questions to ask you .
_UNK_ : In fact , this may be the most important thing we &apos;ve ever reported
and it &apos;s a lot of tragedy , a lot of problems
In many cases , many of the hot problems in this area
because we are at the center of these events
And this happened -- it was great ; it was beautiful .
You &apos;re seeing the birth of a new era .
Chris Anderson : Well , the Western countries have _UNK_
And this is just a little bit more
If the Egypt are now going to vote
So is this government going to accept those values that you have just _UNK_ ?
They &apos;re working hard to get into the _UNK_ ,
In my opinion , these people are more _UNK_
Now , the young people in the Arab world
Chris Anderson : So we don &apos;t have any of their internal affairs .
and believe that the change that &apos;s happening now
_UNK_ : I think we &apos;ve found a big event in the Arab world --
The _UNK_ _UNK_ Network Network Network Network Network Network ,
But I can tell you that this is worth _UNK_ .
to help us all create a better future .
Chris Anderson : Okay , _UNK_ , a group of TED communities
And thank you for them and our inspired and encouraged
When I took this photograph , she was 105 years old .
She often said something that I stopped thinking , like ,
&quot; The time may be able to heal the wound , but it &apos;s not a _UNK_ . &quot;
Let &apos;s see if we can &apos;t keep up with the _UNK_ of this song .
is going to play the guitar by the _UNK_ .
I can meet her as long as I jump further .
Now , what you see is Aunt _UNK_ , a picture of _UNK_ in North Carolina .
I went to the _UNK_ where she learned these _UNK_ .
I took her to the front of the corridor
In the distance , it was her _UNK_ and her _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And then we went to this _UNK_ . Her strength was no longer enough ,
So I was singing , &quot; Hey ! &quot; And she said , &quot; _UNK_ , &quot;
Hey , the black - eyed ! Hey , black eyes , black eyes !
When the beautiful girl came up with a strange thought of evil ,
Hey , hey , hey . Hey , _UNK_ , black eyes , _UNK_ !
Oh , the black - eyed ! Hey , _UNK_ , black eyes !
When I was at the University of _UNK_ , California ,
It was a school full of creative schools ,
I went there to _UNK_ and art , and he came to school
But at the end of the concert , he played a style of old music .
That song can be called _UNK_ , his mother _UNK_ and grandmother .
I &apos;m going to ask it , how can I learn it ?
He said , well , you can go back to _UNK_ , I &apos;m here .
because there &apos;s a lot of old people living in the past .
I was in love with the culture of people and there .
You know , I went back to school and finished my school .
And then I said to my parents that I had to do a _UNK_ player
I think I &apos;m going to show you some images
It &apos;s only some of them , but maybe you get some hint from these _UNK_ .
and play a _UNK_ . Let &apos;s make it integrated .
and finally came to the picture that had just died last year .
He is one of the best non - American stories .
The old Jack told what he knew , sounds like this ,
You can &apos;t understand what he says . But that &apos;s really great .
He lived in the house where his father built .
No water , no electricity . A very good person .
I actually have a website , a lot of my pictures are put on it .
And there are some people I haven &apos;t had the opportunity to show you .
In those photographs you can see this instrument . It &apos;s called _UNK_ .
It &apos;s absolutely the first _UNK_ in the world ,
Now , _UNK_ is no longer playing so bright guitar but doing something like that .
They are just _UNK_ and _UNK_ them together .
It may not be a good thing for a cat , but it produces a good instrument .
Well , don &apos;t you hear a lot of stories that make the family enjoy .
What about the adventures stories of Johnson ?
You know , I call _UNK_ ; we all have a girl with Johnson .
When people saw them all coming up and down their guns
_UNK_ , I call it _UNK_ ; we &apos;ll have a girl with Johnson .
We are driving in the suburbs of Texas ,
I was there for my childhood to be there .
We were able to get back to the suburbs of _UNK_
My mom was driving ; I sat down with my brother .
We were all in our mother &apos;s gas . We looked out of the window .
and there are thousands of acres of cotton .
And we just had the _UNK_ store ,
but my mom refused to buy us a _UNK_
There was a captain of the ring at night .
And her mother was in the air , and she said ,
&quot; You ! You think what you want to do .
You don &apos;t know how much money you earn , your father works so hard .
You think money is coming from the trees . You never feed their labor .
You &apos;re too angry for me , you &apos;re going to find a job in this summer . &quot;
She pulled the car away , and she said , &quot; Get out of me . &quot;
I and my brother fell down the car .
We stood in the cotton of thousands of acres .
there are about 100 black farmers in cotton .
My mom _UNK_ our shoulders and _UNK_ us into cotton fields .
&quot; I &apos;ve got two _UNK_ never done to feed myself . &quot;
Well , that would be a funny proposal for _UNK_ :
Put these two middle - class white children in the field of cotton .
It &apos;s about 10 feet long , so a bag , and we &apos;ll start to pick up cotton .
Now , cotton is very soft , but it &apos;s full of _UNK_ .
I started with my brother and my brother ,
Our hands started to _UNK_ and then it was -- Mom ! &quot;
And mother was sitting next to the car , like this .
I guess the _UNK_ can see him on his head .
He started singing in the dark sound behind us .
He said , &quot; Oh , there &apos;s a broad and long dress in the sky , I know .
Oh , there was a broad _UNK_ in the sky , I knew .
And the people around us started to respond to him , and he said ,
And I don &apos;t want to be in the back . &quot;
in my life with my brother and my brother ,
We stayed there for a day of cotton and no complaints about it ,
&quot; Oh , Mary , you don &apos;t cry , you don &apos;t want to _UNK_ and _UNK_ . &quot;
and I did it , &quot; This is my light . &quot;
We have about a quarter of the cotton in our bags .
But the workers in the farm are still good enough to give us a cheque ,
But my mom never let us get it back .
Now , my mom wants us to learn the value of hard work .
But if you have children , you know , that &apos;s not going to work .
I &apos;m not going to do so hard work again .
But I also learned that some people in the world
It really takes me a lot of work every day .
And I also learned that a wonderful song can make a lot easier .
And it can also _UNK_ people together , and other ways can &apos;t do it .
I was a boy of eight years old .
When my mom put us in the field of Texas ,
I don &apos;t even know what music is -- I don &apos;t know it .
And when that day in the cotton _UNK_ ,
I found that my heart was really _UNK_
And I thought that was the beginning of my _UNK_ .
You &apos;re going to sing , don &apos;t you want to be _UNK_ .
You don &apos;t want to go to the _UNK_ --
You haven &apos;t taken the cotton for a long time , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to be able to do it .
And in these years , I thought about this ,
And after the end -- of course , she was happy to have a story about her ,
But when she came to the end of _UNK_ ,
I looked for a _UNK_ . I found the master of the land .
I just want you to get these kids to learn about hard work .
I don &apos;t know that this will make you fall in love with music .
OK , this is steel guitar . This is the instrument of American manufacturing .
They made _UNK_ , a wooden instrument of wood ,
There &apos;s a _UNK_ -- it &apos;s made from there .
It was made in the _UNK_ of the last century ,
And there was no _UNK_ , they invented it for more _UNK_ guitar .
_UNK_ Americans even say you can break the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
like that -- a nice _UNK_ can play a great piece of music .
It was a great drink yesterday in the wine .
to break the _UNK_ , put it in the hands and start playing .
15 years ago , or 14 years ago , I thought ,
and my wife lost our daughter in a car accident , Sarah .
It was the most -- almost _UNK_ me -- that was almost my life .
I think the reason why I know happiness is ,
to the _UNK_ , just to jump down .
I have to come out of the cause of living .
I must sit down and write all the reasons why I really want to leave ;
I &apos;m going to leave the world for a while .
And of course , the first one that came up with
Jane , and my son , _UNK_ , and my parents -- I don &apos;t want to hurt them .
And then , when I think about other things ,
I don &apos;t care -- I &apos;m going to do it in the radio ,
I have a radio show in the public channel , &quot; _UNK_ , &quot;
I wasn &apos;t interested in that . I didn &apos;t care about money , reward , or other things .
Look at the opening of the spring , the new _UNK_ of hay ,
and catch up a wave and touch a child &apos;s hand ,
Listen to the old record of his uncle and his uncle .
For me , the sound of steel guitar ,
because my parents had given me a guitar .
I &apos;m sitting next to my guitar , but I &apos;m not going to play ,
I was as much as _UNK_ as I could .
And that was _UNK_ , in all my instruments ,
And the song came out of that time .
If you want to talk to me , you know , I &apos;ll hear you all the time .
Don &apos;t mention those things ; I &apos;ll tell you how I usually do .
I &apos;ll break the other _UNK_ and play the steel guitar _UNK_ .
When you don &apos;t move , they find fun everywhere .
And sometimes I want to fall into my sadness .
&quot; You can pick up and sing the steel guitar rhythm .
Now , what can you hide in your mind
But you know that these are not going to give you the destination you want .
I got some _UNK_ to make things different .
_UNK_ to visit me , I &apos;ve just played a _UNK_ _UNK_ guitar .
I think I can tell you that my dad is a inventor .
When the _UNK_ satellite had just launched , we moved to California .
He has a lot of patents in that aspect .
We moved from Michael to John across the street .
the inventor of the computer in the simulated world .
Michael &apos;s father was doing something called a computer .
It was _UNK_ , I was a boy of 10 years old ;
I don &apos;t know what it is . He &apos;s going to see me ,
You know what they &apos;re doing . It &apos;s like a library ,
There was a full of vacuum tubes in the room .
You can put these giant into your pocket one day .
I think , oh my God , that &apos;s a _UNK_ pants !
That Christmas -- maybe I &apos;m going to talk about this --
That Christmas I got a _UNK_ of the _UNK_ chemical set .
I want to be a inventor like my father and Michael .
And we see three very amazing chemicals :
God , we are 10 years old , but we know _UNK_ _UNK_ .
We made a small batch of _UNK_ it on the _UNK_ .
We had a match , and the lights burst . It was really cool .
It was obvious that the next thing to do is to make guns .
He had all sorts of things , and we put a tube inside ,
the switch at the end of the tube ,
And at the bottom of the tube , they took our _UNK_ ,
And the _UNK_ come together and put them in the back of the tube ,
the tube -- and we fill some of our _UNK_ .
to the tube , put three _UNK_ on it , in the garage .
We _UNK_ : We put the plywood in front of it five feet .
The bearing is out - the plywood are as _UNK_ as the _UNK_ paper .
There were two _UNK_ into Michael &apos;s new front door .
We _UNK_ everything , and we burn it in his backyard .
It was gentle granite ; maybe _UNK_ there , in the backyard .
My brother heard that we had done _UNK_ .
He and his partner , they are older and are all _UNK_ .
and I &apos;m going to tell you that we &apos;re going to learn
We said , &quot; Well , what are you going to do ? &quot;
And they said , we &apos;re going to melt the _UNK_ .
So we did a lot of them , and then I --
We &apos;ve just moved there . We &apos;ve just moved to California .
Mother had just _UNK_ the kitchen ; the mother was not home . We found the pie dish .
The _UNK_ is responsible for _UNK_ the dish .
I was standing close to Michael in the kitchen .
_UNK_ said , &quot; Look , it &apos;s melting . It &apos;s going to melt .
It suddenly exploded , _UNK_ , and he looked like this .
The _UNK_ of the mother &apos;s cabinet is a mark of _UNK_ ;
The air is all _UNK_ in the air .
She went home and took the chemical set , and we never met it again .
We often think about it because every mother did tuna
And I thought , as I &apos;m going to end up with my _UNK_ _UNK_ .
When the drum was still a novelty , I was thinking ,
Why don &apos;t we use the oldest music form , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I wrapped these _UNK_ together , _UNK_ into the dress , and 12 _UNK_ .
I did some _UNK_ music to you yesterday ;
And I &apos;m going to show you this today .
I have a switch here , and here we have , here , here .
If I don &apos;t take this _UNK_ up . It &apos;s painful .
Now I &apos;m going to put the drum out the clothes , put it in the drum ,
Let me put them together . And I can do that .
and it changes the sound of the pedal here ,
and let me close it , and I &apos;ll play you .
I was in London three years ago ,
a guy named _UNK_ came to me and said ,
We want to establish a theory of physics
We have _UNK_ dollars , and we want to do it .
young people are full of imagination , but they have power .
I thought about 25 seconds , and it was a good idea .
And three years later , we became the physics institute in _UNK_ ,
This is the best job that I &apos;ve ever experienced .
I found my first job in _UNK_ , and I was worried about it ,
because when I &apos;m here this week , there &apos;s nothing going to happen .
I &apos;m going to take a short time in my limited talk ,
and I &apos;m going to show you a quick visit
And we thought a lot about what is going on .
you know , what you &apos;re learning in school
On the other hand , we demonstrated the _UNK_
And that &apos;s what a democratic society has to do .
because scientists are groups that are connected by common ideas .
I don &apos;t read it , after all , I &apos;m not going to teach today .
_UNK_ : Every scientist will be convinced to be true .
And it &apos;s a very , very vague thing .
which is that there are _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
It &apos;s only 30 years later , 50 years later ,
and the _UNK_ that we need to move forward
in the _UNK_ of this kind of model ,
is not just the idea of science ,
and the idea of doing a citizen in democratic society
people think about space , time and the universe ,
How do we think about how we live in society
I want to talk about three stages of evolution .
in the first stage of the universe ,
The Earth &apos;s center , and the second is that these crystal rings
the sun , the moon , the planet , the last celestial sphere
everything in the universe has its own position .
all the things are going to be done , of course ,
is the social rule of Aristotle &apos;s life .
And more importantly , the Middle Ages of _UNK_
All things are determined , and the location of things is _UNK_ .
In the solar system , it is the eternal heaven .
In _UNK_ , Newton had a _UNK_ of
of space , time and sports , and so on .
At the same time , _UNK_ and his partner
They think about space , time , the movement is going to happen
On the other hand , the way they think about society
There is no center in the universe -- thank you .
They &apos;re not much more _UNK_ than a fixed space .
In space , the absolute point of objects is not significant .
because this definition is not something that is common .
but it &apos;s not the universe that is absolute ,
Some people have relative rights , certain forms of assets
And some of you are considered to have
absolutely , abstract rights , justice , and so on .
These privilege exist , not by social laws , any individual ,
and the constraints of the history of history
And he said in a certain sense , in the universe ,
because he doesn &apos;t exist in the world ,
Because through space , God knows everything is true .
This is what &apos;s called the traditional political theory .
to the _UNK_ of the 20th century ,
In the 20th century , there was a change
And the combination , eventually , _UNK_ and quantum theory
This is the top of the theory of gravity .
In the universe , there is no real thing . There is no _UNK_ .
The universe is a network of relationships
And the space is just one hand , so that
There are only two places in the world .
all of the things that are in these connections .
And if you &apos;re in this connection network ,
Your _UNK_ and the Internet through this connection
to understand all the _UNK_ , or the _UNK_ God ,
This is the general theory of relativity , quantum theory .
If you go to the legal expert ,
What we just talked about is the idea of connection
It &apos;s mainly _UNK_ , and there &apos;s nothing else in the universe .
Every time you see something that &apos;s _UNK_ , the structure is completely _UNK_ .
&quot; _UNK_ &quot; means that men and women
And the only possible explanation in the universe is that they make themselves
because the God of the universe doesn &apos;t exist .
This is different from the universe of _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
In the universe , we must have their own organization
Darwin told us that the process of _UNK_
is rich , to explain ourselves , and what we see
is only suitable for the universe that is connected .
And in the universe of Newton , it was _UNK_ .
So , based on the theory of natural selection
And it &apos;s going to take a step further .
The natural rule is best suited to the universe .
_UNK_ is the result of all things in the world .
If there &apos;s no gravity , life will not exist .
The gravity leads to a long life of stars
to prevent the world , like the surface of the Earth ,
in the heat balance , over billions of years , life can develop .
We see that two major subjects in science
in the process of self - organization , the complexity of complexity ,
This is the success of the new _UNK_ .
In _UNK_ , this theory _UNK_ into understanding
based on our research , finding out the meaning
It &apos;s really the universe that &apos;s _UNK_ by connection .
On the other hand , it &apos;s a way to organize or _UNK_ ,
and our research on society , is going to continue
If you look at democracy from this perspective ,
the _UNK_ meaning of democracy is that , you know ,
there &apos;s a lot of different interests , different plans .
Some people might be a _UNK_ in some areas .
I think science is always around us .
In fact , I &apos;ve finished . Science is always around us .
I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of people already know
And the foundation of the book , and then it &apos;s _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ from Julia _UNK_ , who was completely _UNK_ .
in Los Angeles , in Los Angeles , in the streets ,
I encourage you to look at Steve _UNK_ , or look at the movie .
And that was the ultimate change of _UNK_
He just heard _UNK_ , the fourth symphony ,
He was happy , and he was very _UNK_ .
_UNK_ may not be able to go into the World Cup .
And this is because the final _UNK_ _UNK_
We talked for a while . A few days later I received Steve &apos;s letter
and told me I was interested in learning violin
because what he did was he had an electric therapy
the scars that were left in his life .
And the result is that the _UNK_
to expose the _UNK_ of the heart , to the heart ,
And the _UNK_ was at the beginning of this situation ,
And we started at the Disney Hall ,
He was _UNK_ in the eyes of his eyes .
how many people were going to sleep to him ,
And he would fall into a certain state of his state
And I would ruined his relationship with the violin
I played the first movement of _UNK_ _UNK_
It seems that he grabbed what was _UNK_ .
It was like a chemical response , and I played it .
_UNK_ , he took up his violin ,
And then he &apos;s going to do it again , the door is open .
from the _UNK_ to the _UNK_ of _UNK_
And he had the experience of these music
He talked about the things that were passionate and _UNK_
And I know that this is the essence of art .
And this is why we create music .
And we have a kind of inner _UNK_
By our creative , we shape our emotions into reality .
And music took him back to a bunch of friends
Robert _UNK_ : Now I &apos;m going to play a piece of music from the _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to close up every seven years
I started in New York City in the first place
more than you don &apos;t listen to the musicians
And I found that I was going to find
Look , the book hide a glass eye ,
So we decided to shut down the door
to learn about three billion years ago ,
and put them in the end of the day ,
to take five years of retirement time ,
is the result of a few years on vacation .
There was a TED _UNK_ two years ago ,
I can think of work as a _UNK_ , _UNK_ is money .
and we &apos;re going to be waiting for the weekend Thursday .
I might need a amateur hobby , a balanced life .
But sometimes I think that I &apos;m going to think about
How much energy is it worth to spend ?
My first _UNK_ was spent in New York City .
I was so familiar with them , so I chose Asia .
I see the most beautiful landscape in Asia
There was still a civil war , so I chose _UNK_ .
the place itself is full of spiritual _UNK_ .
to get rid of the _UNK_ dog ,
We did the 99 dog like a series of _UNK_ .
I had to buy it again and again .
So one of the things I &apos;m going to do in _UNK_
In design , of course , we still have a fight with the wild dog .
I remember to finish the light of the light ,
And I designed this little coffee table
And then I designed this rather _UNK_ chair ,
In _UNK_ , I began to _UNK_ my first _UNK_
to listen to other people about their happy things .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about it .
And _UNK_ was writing this book in the _UNK_ ,
The best cook in the world today
Look at my cycle , do seven years , _UNK_ ,
Look at the companies that I &apos;m more successful
_UNK_ , and he used the private time for three M ,
Is there anybody in the audience trying to get a _UNK_ ?
Would you like to sit in your hands ?
Please talk to them , see if their holiday is successful .
to talk about what I want to do in the future .
The best way to do it is to
And I decided to write a little bit about the day
And I told a lot of people , the more the better
I &apos;m not going to be able to get a _UNK_ later .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a plan
that I have all _UNK_ , I mean , other things .
for example , to write to the Japanese magazine ,
I &apos;ve got a list of things that I &apos;m interested in .
to take them together , to give them the time
and then make a plan , like in the _UNK_ ,
What is the plan ? 8 to _UNK_ : write fiction .
It &apos;s not very successful . And so on , etc .
And these arrangements are very good for me .
In the long run , my first _UNK_ is successful .
Because of the quality , we can play a higher price .
and it was a year of our holiday .
is the design of seven years after that long vacation .
And the first thing that we can do
And it &apos;s actually going to be the same idea .
It &apos;s only going to work for a few companies
The music home ( _UNK_ de _UNK_ ) once asked us to design logo .
And even though I wanted to take this logo
is because the _UNK_ has done a presentation
And he said , &quot; Well , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
And I realized that the building itself was a logo .
Let me write a software by a friend of mine
to put any images , like _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
to give you the _UNK_ of your music ,
When you want to design a _UNK_ like _UNK_ ,
And that software is useful because the visual elements
So , in terms of the concept , they must be able to cooperate with each other .
If the music of the show , it will have its own unique logo .
In the interior of the music , whether the music _UNK_ , or the music director .
Their music house was printed on their cards .
And it &apos;s very convenient to be able to
You can draw the _UNK_ according to its shape .
You can design a _UNK_ , introduce a home to a _UNK_ , outside the music home .
The second kind of experience : before that _UNK_ ,
And these are all taken out of this idea .
The title is &quot; What I &apos;ve learned now
in the _UNK_ of a New York City ,
And you can see the _UNK_ coming back .
to give us a square and do something .
for more than a week , a hundred volunteers
I &apos;m going to take the money as much as possible .
or to keep the image up there .
There &apos;s a lot of people around the world
and looked at it , and it loved it .
and put the money into the bag until he had _UNK_ .
and then they all _UNK_ up their money .
and see if they could sweep out their heads ,
And we started a bigger project in _UNK_
We tried to use the geese for a while .
And my studio was on the forest of monkeys
And we asked these guys to help us .
And of course , if you don &apos;t do it yourself ,
We &apos;re going to make this film for the next two years .
except for the snow and some available spaces ,
Our professional is _UNK_ . The profession contains all shapes and sizes .
It can be small . Like a _UNK_ , a _UNK_ cup .
And these works have a common kind of thing ,
is to challenge people to think about space .
These habits are so obvious that we neglect their similarity .
to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It &apos;s like nothing , or it &apos;s almost nothing .
in the world of our natural _UNK_ ,
This is a picture of our Geneva near Switzerland .
in the _UNK_ of the United States
What we do is not just the background ,
It &apos;s just a piece of water , a big cloud of clouds .
This proposal has an _UNK_ response to the saturated .
in the world &apos;s latest emergency technology in the world ,
We &apos;re _UNK_ to find energy and release energy .
to do a bigger visual _UNK_ for the first time .
The _UNK_ of the subjective conditions has become the mainstream .
We propose that we can use technology , _UNK_ technology .
to make it a fair definition of _UNK_ ,
The space and appearance of the _UNK_ in the treaty .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
by using high pressure spray to form a fine mist ,
A weather station that is formed by _UNK_ people .
the central processor will deal with the data
The system has been trained by the weather change .
So this is not just architecture , but it &apos;s a whole structure .
And there &apos;s 300 feet in this area ,
It is located between the four columns of _UNK_ .
The system is like the _UNK_ of weather change .
No matter why . We have a great interest in the weather .
You can express the transformation of the external space .
into the fog space like a place to live .
There is only a _UNK_ _UNK_ and a white noise _UNK_ .
where you can &apos;t see anything at all .
And we &apos;re proud -- this is another world .
All the scenes will attract the eyes of people .
all the cuts are put back in _UNK_ .
is because there is a continuous fog of _UNK_ .
This is the way Victoria used fog during the period of fiction .
This is going to be the focus of the world ,
The water is sprayed out of the _UNK_ .
So the water is filled with the whole world ,
people think that in the middle of the world
We can walk here , and we can breathe
but we should have a deep understanding of it .
with the sensory touch that is sensitive to the bottom .
And we did this project that was quite easy ,
because the Swiss say , &quot; Why are we going to
to create a kind of natural phenomenon that we hate ?
We work hard -- we tried to persuade them .
And finally , you know , this will be a national logo .
We represent Switzerland , you know , you know ,
and every one has its own ideas .
In short , it &apos;s just a final structure that will be destroyed ,
And although it &apos;s just a very specific picture ,
The Swiss architect -- a chocolate _UNK_ --
In &apos; 90s we all know that we &apos;re going to work independently ,
In 2003 , we looked at our work in _UNK_
There &apos;s a lot of people from 80 , in the &apos; 90s .
But the essence of this is not to comment on the work itself .
These are some of the parts of the show .
Now , this is a part of the American _UNK_ .
The project in New York is now _UNK_ , a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s a lot of these kinds of projects .
In any way , they provided the fourth layer of display .
You work in a theory that you can understand
We don &apos;t really have to achieve that goal .
to try to _UNK_ this theme , actually ,
It &apos;s a bit of a _UNK_ to the museum .
_UNK_ in the museum , like the walls need white .
is that we have a lot of devices .
But these white walls become a weapon and goal .
We divided this project into 13 pieces of equipment
and _UNK_ the sound and the visual phase .
The red line shows the state of these elements ,
to create a new piece of block .
We use a robot that _UNK_ around ,
The walls of the museum are running around , and a lot of damage .
The drill is _UNK_ into a robot arm .
We use bees , and this is the brain .
and it &apos;s really interesting to work with them .
They didn &apos;t do their first job in the world ,
In any case , it should be based on intelligence navigation .
the location of the location of the _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to produce a _UNK_ model .
The _UNK_ is accurate and then the _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
_UNK_ a half inch old _UNK_ began a new round .
The holes between the walls of the wall are connected .
These holes open a part of the wall .
It &apos;s getting more and more and less stable .
and it &apos;s going to be a constant noise . It &apos;s annoying .
The video block has been completely useless .
is going to be a neutral background as an art .
It starts to break the _UNK_ . It &apos;s really great .
and look at a project that we did a year ago .
This is the contemporary art institute in Boston ,
We don &apos;t have too much time to introduce this building ,
And it looks like the _UNK_ of nature
This is a very good place in Boston .
And the paradox is that it &apos;s inside the museum .
So , the nature of the building is how it looks like --
So , you walk into the _UNK_ Theater ,
In the second part of the theater , _UNK_ the space .
You walk into the glass elevator near the window .
The elevator has a great _UNK_ in the city of New York .
The theater can open or refuse these eyes and become a background .
Many musicians choose to open the glass wall of the theatre .
and then to the north of the _UNK_ .
just allow a few vertical perspectives of the world .
in a very narrow space , connected the eastern and Western corridor .
The goal is not to connect the _UNK_ together .
So the perspective is going to change as you move .
because it &apos;s too good to look at it .
And the mayor said , &quot; No , we just open it . &quot;
But the best thing -- and that &apos;s why I put it in the speech .
in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ of the building .
This is a _UNK_ of 80 feet -- it &apos;s pretty strong .
The outstanding part of this small part is called _UNK_ .
Look at the number art or _UNK_ the art work .
This is a very important part of the building ,
It &apos;s like the _UNK_ of technology , the architecture is just a framework ,
It _UNK_ the harbor view of the _UNK_ ,
through the wall , the floor and the ceiling
the horizontal and the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s like the _UNK_ that created the electronic _UNK_ ,
And here we really feel , this is a great technology .
and that is the engineering of nature .
But there &apos;s no information , it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just a _UNK_ state .
This is the first _UNK_ of the project , 50 years ago .
And we &apos;re taking over and over and over ,
from some small maintenance to big _UNK_ and equipment .
But what we do is not a passion .
This is going to work on the expansion of 2010 .
I want to talk about a part of a project .
even the theme of a little bit of concrete ,
and we &apos;re going to be able to focus on .
This is _UNK_ _UNK_ , and it &apos;s below Julia _UNK_ .
Here , this is the entrance to the _UNK_ before _UNK_ ,
We &apos;ll ask ourselves , why don &apos;t we make it more _UNK_ ?
like _UNK_ or other located in the Lincoln Center ?
And one of the things that we &apos;re asked
As a street building , the extension hall and makes it very _UNK_ .
And the building is a natural seal .
And in this room that was _UNK_ by _UNK_ ,
on the back side is _UNK_ by the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s about _UNK_ feet , and it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ street ,
and then use the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
For a minute , this is just a _UNK_ that we have a lot of things .
But what I want to do is take a few seconds
We really spend a lot of work on it .
The customer asked us to design a top room hall .
Now , the design of a _UNK_ seat is very easy .
The _UNK_ and the _UNK_ of the play are together .
They asked us to touch all the parts of the room .
How do you get a close contact to the whole world ?
to contact us with different kinds of things .
It means that the contact between the _UNK_ and vision
A subway is often _UNK_ from the lobby .
and that &apos;s the shape of the hall that we &apos;re going to change .
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ , basically sending all sorts of sounds ,
This is a _UNK_ music hall , but the idea of garbage , visual garbage ,
It &apos;s very important to us to get rid of the visual _UNK_ .
First of all , we have a box apart ,
in order to eliminate the noise of the subway .
and then _UNK_ the whole hall -- _UNK_ _UNK_ --
But the acoustic engineering will focus on the sound of the house .
and the sound of the stage and it &apos;s a _UNK_ .
Look at the hall . It &apos;s just a part of the stage .
So we _UNK_ all of the visual _UNK_ ,
We &apos;re going to link the building , the audience and the _UNK_ ,
A special effect on the building : a light .
We believe that the drama of the music hall
and we have a good time in the middle .
So we want to make these -- that &apos;s the effect ,
We have the _UNK_ of the biological engineering .
We need to use resin , a very thick resin ,
These resin looks like wood in the face of the wood ,
_UNK_ the hall , like a belt , not separate ,
like a stage to tell the audience and the actor
This is a model of the Salt Lake City .
to give you a whole concept of scale .
This is a boy from Salt Lake City ,
For us , I think this is really weird ,
But in the music hall , it was a moment of noise .
And when the audience looked forward to the beginning of the show ,
and it feels like the _UNK_ or the _UNK_ rises ,
The _UNK_ began to _UNK_ all the audience &apos;s attention .
Because I &apos;m _UNK_ , this is my end .
I don &apos;t know how you think Chris , I don &apos;t know .
So friendly , all week . He &apos;s friendly for you to say something ,
And worse , I took the car to your house .
and your wife and your best friend _UNK_ . &quot;
You know , Chris would say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
&quot; Thank you for taking me to a place I don &apos;t know , thank you . &quot;
And one of them thank you for coming to us .
And what &apos;s happening in TED this week is ,
All the speakers are saying that you &apos;re going to say .
nuclear power , I used to spend 10 minutes above this .
So this morning , I thought , &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll do a _UNK_ . &quot;
I think we all agree to this today , isn &apos;t it ?
I thought I would end with a dance ,
So , what I thought I would do was to do with Mali --
I &apos;m going to be the first time in the world today
If I can start , this is a _UNK_ machine
His expression told me , &quot; No , don &apos;t do that , really , don &apos;t .
And one of the things they said , &quot; You can use
15 minutes to change the world , 15 minutes to change the world .
I don &apos;t know what you are , I &apos;ll use 15 minutes to change the plug .
So , the idea of change the world is really extraordinary .
Because our consciousness , we don &apos;t have to use _UNK_ .
a demonstration of wireless power , wonderful , you know , this _UNK_ us .
If he was a _UNK_ , he would be burned out .
Some people who look at the world in different eyes .
and I &apos;m going to talk about all of you .
But when you look at the _UNK_ like this ,
This will make a whole new experience of Starbucks , don &apos;t you think about it ?
I mean , he was sure to go in and they would say ,
&quot; You don &apos;t mind us to play the next customer ? &quot;
Her speech was about chimpanzees , and connected , of course ,
And the truth is that we are all naked bodies ,
We have no _UNK_ , we still have a swimming expert .
She said , &quot; You know , she &apos;s 90 , she said she &apos;s not going to have time .
She had to find more evidence of the connection .
And then I thought , &quot; I &apos;m sitting next to my seat is _UNK_ . &quot;
How many evidence do you want to do this man ?
I wasn &apos;t there yesterday . I didn &apos;t see _UNK_ ,
And the question is , because Brown , who stands on the stage
And he was like a bear in a suit .
to expect that the world is going to be .
&quot; Well , can I tell you what happened in the woods ?
&quot; Sorry , I &apos;m only 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world ,
I &apos;m only 18 minutes , very sorry , I can &apos;t tell you
how much we did in the Great _UNK_
like what we do in the airport _UNK_ . &quot;
And the exciting news is that today ,
&quot; But to be honest , when I was 11 years old , I never found it a problem . &quot;
I can talk to you about _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ and I have a good relationship to me .
&quot; You know , before I work , I sent him a note , and I said ,
Can I get your support in the next month ? &quot;
And then he said , &quot; No , you don &apos;t have to go . &quot;
And that was amazing , because I never seen anybody like that .
And the other thing that _UNK_ could talk about
No one was going to listen to the matter .
But when people were talking about the industrial economy , he said ,
&quot; What &apos;s going on in the city of London
We , as a government , want to contribute to the same economy . &quot;
you &apos;ll see what &apos;s happening in the economy , you think .
&quot; This is a man who is a _UNK_ . &quot;
But we &apos;re in a new world . We &apos;re in a completely new world .
I could remember the first time , if you were in your bank manager ,
to receive a letter of _UNK_ , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to go from him .
He &apos;s going to borrow money from you here .
Why do you know ? Why , it seems like someone
will respond to the email from Nigeria , right ?
Then , you know , Iceland , never went to _UNK_ it .
What does it have ? It &apos;s got a lot of fish , it &apos;s going to be .
And that &apos;s why the Prime Minister wants television , and says ,
I did a lot of things , and I tried to _UNK_
to give it a sense of what &apos;s going on .
But it &apos;s very difficult to tell the financial crisis .
And of course , another person , is Donald _UNK_ , saying ,
&quot; What we know in the world is that they know what we know .
and the unknown thing , the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ ,
As an Englishman , when I first heard these , I thought , &quot; It &apos;s _UNK_ ! &quot;
But now , in fact , it &apos;s very clear .
because they don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
In 2006 , the American mortgage specialist said , I quote him ,
This is a man who _UNK_ his job .
But when the crisis happened , the _UNK_ brothers
So this is extraordinary . It &apos;s a very difficult world to explain .
But we have a new hope that we have a new character .
The United States just voted a black - eyed black president .
Not just that , he was _UNK_ , did you notice ?
And you see , a lot of people I &apos;m _UNK_
Last night , someone said to me , you know , as a _UNK_ ,
You have to learn to write at the same time
I think that &apos;s a great metaphor , isn &apos;t it ? It &apos;s not a _UNK_ ink .
Do you like this ? Instead , you can see
I think maybe the _UNK_ in the ocean , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m just right , but I seem to make ink . &quot;
This is the American history , the eight minutes of my career ,
&quot; It was the end of the time .
I also believe it &apos;s the end of the time .
I know a lot of people say that this is the American history
They say there is no relationship between Iraq and _UNK_ .
&quot; But I have a word to _UNK_ those people .
&quot; We promise you will not have the next time . &quot;
But now he &apos;s gone , and we &apos;re lucky to see
One of the speakers , the Obama Department of _UNK_ .
You may be able to hear it in the election .
He was talking about the crowd in Chicago ,
I can &apos;t finish it , it &apos;s too much time , really .
But you know what I mean and then it &apos;s a _UNK_ .
He and the chief judge of the ruling court , they _UNK_ each other ,
They had done the wrong thing , and they _UNK_ it .
And then the _UNK_ sat there and said , &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
But what &apos;s interesting is that _UNK_ Brown is talking about this _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ said people would listen to their speech , &quot; Great speech . &quot;
We all want to believe that Obama &apos;s president ,
It &apos;s like a line in &quot; The _UNK_ . &quot;
You remember the _UNK_ and Jack &apos;s film ,
What do you see when Helen _UNK_ says to Jack _UNK_ ? &quot;
&quot; You want me to be a better person . &quot;
You want a _UNK_ you , the challenge you
Let you become a president of better citizens , right ?
We like to talk about Obama , but we don &apos;t have any action .
So , he came to this country and said ,
And then France and Germany said , &quot; No , no , forget that ,
He said , &quot; We need to support Afghanistan . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , no , no , we &apos;re going to do that .
More than 5,000 , no rockets , no , no , no , no . &quot;
He came to _UNK_ and said , &quot; We believe a _UNK_ world . &quot;
It &apos;s really nice to have a _UNK_ American president ,
So , what &apos;s going on ? We have Bill Clinton .
&quot; I believe that the President of _UNK_ said , &quot;
&quot; create a better world , if you can ,
And I &apos;d like to go to the White House ,
so she won &apos;t be in our house for four years .
&quot; So , when this doesn &apos;t work , I have to do some _UNK_ and let me tell you . &quot;
So , this is him . In Britain , we have Charles _UNK_ .
&quot; The environment is very important , we can all do it .
My wife has begun to do my work , and I think about it .
Or here &apos;s South Africa , and we have Nelson Mandela as _UNK_ .
is from a military visit , a _UNK_ program .
&quot; Well , Nelson Mandela , do you want a nice _UNK_ ? &quot;
_UNK_ : I don &apos;t know how to end this talk ,
until yesterday , a person quote &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot;
So , one thing about _UNK_ is beauty .
because it suggests that there is still a space growing .
About 17 years ago , I began to _UNK_ the air of Delhi .
And every three to four months will _UNK_ the plant outside the sun .
We need six to eight _UNK_ and these plants .
You can produce all the fresh air you need .
You can cover the cap , and you also _UNK_ it .
There are 300 _UNK_ in the building , placed near 1200 _UNK_ .
If a man _UNK_ 10 hours in the building , his chances of _UNK_ a percentage point .
This is the most healthy building in Delhi .
The lung function reduces 12 % of asthma reduced to _UNK_ .
This research has been published in September 2008 ,
can download from the website of the Indian government .
and the energy demand of the building goes down to 15 percent ,
because there is no need to be so many fresh air from outside .
In the future 15 % of the world population will live in millions of _UNK_ .
is going to change the world , first to get it .
_UNK_ : What is the story behind the brooch ?
I want to say that this is a _UNK_ conference , you have carefully chosen brooch .
_UNK_ : Most of the time you get up in the morning
I used to think about what &apos;s going to happen this day .
If you don &apos;t mention the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
I was the ambassador of the United States .
is that it keeps talking about _UNK_ things .
It was his _UNK_ -- because he _UNK_ another country .
So suddenly , there was a poem on the newspaper in _UNK_
So I have a _UNK_ brooch for the _UNK_ .
And when we talk about Iraq , I took it .
And when I came out with the media ,
Their focus is , &quot; Why are you going to wear _UNK_ ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Because the _UNK_ compared me to a _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
And then I went to buy a lot of _UNK_
what I was going to do in the day .
And there &apos;s a book called &quot; _UNK_ my brooch . &quot;
And this is what happens in many women ,
So what do you think about all these things ?
because nobody has ever been to describe the dress of a male state .
but people are very focused on my dress .
I went to New York City to the U.N. ambassador ,
I talked to my former ambassador in Patrick
She said , &quot; You have to give up your _UNK_ .
So this allows me to have a lot of opportunity to go shopping .
What hat am I wearing ? How short is my skirt ?
If you remember _UNK_ to the party , she wore her boots ,
No male will be accused of this . But it is difficult to tolerate women .
PM : For all of us , women and men ,
to change the world in order to change
_UNK_ : Well , what &apos;s interesting is that I &apos;m asked
When I was appointed the first American woman Secretary of State ,
And I said , &quot; I &apos;ve been 60 years old ,
but I was only a few minutes as a Secretary of State . &quot;
I think some of the people in the audience
I first attended the first meeting in the United Nations .
I sat there -- 15 members of the U.N. Security Council
I think -- well , you know what we normally feel .
You want to feel the atmosphere of the room ,
And all of a sudden I thought , _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m sitting in the logo of the United States .
the voice of the United States will not be heard .
This is the first time I feel that
and decided I had to _UNK_ my country .
But I really think that in many ways
and it &apos;s going to be more obvious when necessary .
But I had to tell you that my little daughter ,
&quot; What is the big deal as the Secretary of State ?
PM : From her birth to this point -- this is true .
What about women and girls in the global agenda ?
So , that means that we have to remember
And although many of us have the opportunity --
-- _UNK_ , you &apos;ve been the real leaders in this field
and understand that women have to help themselves .
The problem of women is the center of the American foreign policy ,
because I believe that it &apos;s better for me
where we have the economy and the political _UNK_
In the U.N. , the ambassador and the following work of Secretary .
to make women a key player in diplomatic policy ?
I thought they thought it was a issue of _UNK_ .
because of the things that are going to happen
because this is the center of what we think about .
In many wars women are all the major victims .
And then we tried to build a crime court
By the way , I was just going to take a ride
I was in the U.N. at the time .
But it was the first time I didn &apos;t do lunch with myself .
I think when I go to my room ,
I got there , six other women in _UNK_ countries .
So as the United States , I decided to organize a meeting .
is that they could _UNK_ a war weapon ,
And then there was no women who might be you --
You believe that you can tell us why ,
_UNK_ : Well , I really think that when more women are involved ,
For example , when I did what I did in _UNK_ ,
We &apos;d better say that we should be _UNK_ for others .
And this is what &apos;s going on in the world .
So when one of us came up , this is a great thing .
For example , the president of _UNK_ now ,
But then she was a foreign minister in _UNK_
In a particular stage , the _UNK_ of the European Union .
because I think you will understand some of these things .
And when I say , &quot; Well , I think we should do something about this , &quot;
And they said , &quot; What do you mean , what do you feel ? &quot;
Then the _UNK_ sat down on the side of the table .
And suddenly we all talk about arms control ,
And she said , &quot; Well , I think we should do that . &quot;
My male colleagues suddenly knew what was like .
And the other thing that I think is important :
and set up their budget decision in their country .
in the world to find this balance ?
_UNK_ : Well , I think one thing is :
To make sure that women have to help each other .
believe that some other women accused me of ,
I think we often feel guilty of each other .
In fact , I think guilty &quot; is the middle of every woman .
My _UNK_ is a special place in hell .
PM : Okay , Secretary of State , I guess you will be _UNK_ .
And the title comes up with &quot; happy &quot; ,
They count about 40 copies , and there are more _UNK_ .
More and more researchers are starting to be happy
And even though it &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ ,
These _UNK_ will increase the understanding of people
I &apos;m going to talk about these cognitive _UNK_ today .
And these _UNK_ are influenced by the general sense of happiness ,
because we &apos;re all going to be wrong .
because we &apos;ve been explaining too many things .
I think we should be _UNK_ about it ,
And we had to give up the idea
and look at it in a more complex way .
The second trap is a _UNK_ between experience and memory :
and it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ when you &apos;re happy .
And unfortunately , in any case , when we think about it ,
The worst impression of what happened was just memory of this experience .
And the other 20 minutes of the meeting was completely forgotten .
And we were thinking about ourselves and others ,
And the general doctor &apos;s contact is self - experience --
&quot; Where do I touch you here ? &quot;
And he was responsible for recording life ,
or &quot; go to _UNK_ ? &quot; And so on .
The confusion between them is that we don &apos;t know happiness .
and the story is just picking up in memory --
It &apos;s not the story that we &apos;re going to talk about .
It &apos;s what we &apos;ve stored in our experience
The details are no longer _UNK_ . The current treatment is not so painful ,
But in the &apos; 90s , the approach was _UNK_ .
The patient has to report their pain index every 60 seconds .
I asked you , &quot; Who &apos;s the most painful thing in them ? &quot;
The patient has a feeling of _UNK_ every minute .
And this is the end of the story --
The two stories are not so smart --
It was obvious that one of them felt worse than the other .
What is the world in the final period of knowledge .
It turns out that the memory of A is worse than B .
from the perspective of the experience of self ,
And when the experiment was done , we had expected results ,
In fact , we can extend the patient &apos;s _UNK_
to slow down the _UNK_ of the ducts .
And if you continue to go on this ,
But the patient &apos;s memory of a person
And the story that we tell is really true .
He has a moment of experience , and one after one .
you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How are these moments ? &quot;
Most of us live in our lives --
There is about a moment in the life of a person .
And as a result of the experience of self ,
The second week is as happy as the first week ,
But remember self is not the same thing .
Because if your patient has been in the past ,
And the memory feels better than that one ,
We don &apos;t think about it in a form of experience .
memory is a _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
I think it &apos;s kind of hard to look at it .
How many of the memories we use ?
And it reminds me of a holiday ,
And this is the best holiday I &apos;ve ever done ,
I was always reminded of the holiday of this holiday .
And the three weeks of the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s about 25 minutes over the last four years .
More than one and a half hours of memories .
And it makes me feel a little bit _UNK_ ,
because I remember that it was too small ,
Why are we going to be used to memory
is more than the experience of the experience ?
When you know that the end of the holiday
you have to think about the conflict ,
And so you ask , &quot; Experience is so happy ? &quot;
And then you ask , &quot; Every moment of experience
has already been a shallow concept of being .
and the joy of the happiness of the individual .
This is not a problem of living in a person .
but it &apos;s about the life of its own life .
to be able to learn from happiness ,
I was as good as any other student in my life ,
has been studying happiness all the time ,
Now , we &apos;re trying to measure each other ,
In addition to this issue , the company also made another survey .
In recent years , we &apos;ve been learning about
And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that
And although you can learn whether a person is satisfied with life ,
just to give you a basic idea of _UNK_ ,
You are told that his father had six feet high ,
If I say somebody &apos;s life score , he &apos;s _UNK_ ,
So if you want two _UNK_ to be happy ,
is not going to be happy as a good thing .
And that &apos;s how we look at life .
and how we live in a different way .
So , when you ask people who are happy in California ,
You will not be able to get the right answer .
And it &apos;s also about thinking about self ,
But since the reality of thinking about self ,
Some people might be able to get a conclusion like this ,
They &apos;re _UNK_ California for more happy life ,
but tracking them with a very interesting thing .
But when one thing happened , they felt more happy .
They would remember the bad weather in Ohio .
They also felt that they had the right decision .
And I hope I have a basic idea of this ,
Chris Anderson : Thank you for your talk . I have a question to ask you .
A few weeks ago , we had a phone call ,
And you &apos;re talking about your survey from _UNK_
We have a couple of minutes of time .
I found a very interesting number in the _UNK_ survey ,
to find out that it was an accident .
This is a big part of the sample ,
And the lower income , the more they are not happy .
For another self , memory is self - _UNK_ .
The more you make , the more you are satisfied .
CA : But Danny , life , liberty and pursuit of happiness
The political character of this country is not possible .
_UNK_ : I think there are people who understand happiness
in the position of the policy of the _UNK_ .
But the idea is that the spread speed in the United States
So , very quickly , we &apos;re going to understand the problem .
There are several ways , but you know how you think about it ,
I think it will affect policy in a few years .
I think in 10 years or 20 years ,
Chris Anderson : This is a big issue for me .
that people are always thinking about life .
whether it should have reproductive , metabolism , or evolution these characteristics .
I don &apos;t know the answer to this question , so I &apos;m not going to tell you that
in the cell , this program will be done in the future .
or some small changes , and it &apos;s going to build a guy like this .
to convince you that this metaphor is really true .
In many common ways , it can help you believe this metaphor
that makes the difference in the evolution of life .
Or you can take this _UNK_ leg in this long way .
is that you can have these tiny changes
If you have a dollar in your bank account , you just need to change that number
So that &apos;s the little change that makes me think about
They suggest that a complex process of computing
So , all of these are _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
And it also shows the powerful force of these molecules
What I want to do is write some potential
And there &apos;s a lot of people who work on it .
There &apos;s a lot of biologists doing this , like Craig _UNK_ ,
to create a language for the beginning of the new thing .
There are all these machines in the cell ,
This is some of the switches of the genes .
This is the _UNK_ , and the motor that drives muscles .
is trying to _UNK_ all of these components
We &apos;re not a _UNK_ _UNK_ , but DNA is the cheap .
The most easy to understand , and also suitable for its programming .
If other molecules become easy to use
If we &apos;re successful , what would the molecular programming look like ?
You &apos;re going to sit in front of your computer
You &apos;re going to design something like cell phones .
And if you use a _UNK_ language , you can describe this cell
and then turn it into the real molecules
_UNK_ can be able to _UNK_ these molecules together into a seed .
If you give it a water and grow it ?
a molecular computing process , and build a computer .
I think the process of life begins with molecular computers
These new computers will build new electronic computers , and so on .
And if you believe life is all about computation ,
that you &apos;re looking at an important problem with a computer scientist .
One important question is , how does babies know when to stop growth ?
And the question is , if your cell phone knows when you stop growing ,
or how a computer program knows when to stop running ,
Or even more concrete , how do you know a program is going to stop .
And I think he was actually a computer scientist
And when he studied the genome , you know , bacteria will be smaller .
We need to put a number of molecules in seeds to make it a cell
the smallest number we need is how much
And the scientists tell us that these are pretty difficult problems .
But for some of them , we can begin to answer
The problem about DNA structure , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about .
in a normal DNA that you think is normal DNA .
because there &apos;s a A , T , C , G to hold two _UNK_ together .
I &apos;m going to show you the structure of DNA
We just look at these two kinds of _UNK_ , and it &apos;s not _UNK_ .
So we can make this blue line in a tube
And in another test , the orange tube was produced .
But when you mix them together , they form a stable double spiral .
have been working hard , and we use these kinds of DNA _UNK_ together .
and made a beautiful three-dimensional structure of it .
And most of them are fine , but they need a long time
Maybe it takes two years , and it &apos;s very difficult to design
So I came up with this new approach a few years ago .
This is a very simple technology that you can even do in your own kitchen
But to do that , you need a long _UNK_ DNA
He has a genome that is not very good .
to see his _UNK_ , there are billions of bacteria
It &apos;s also _UNK_ , but in the inside , it &apos;s infected .
We can fold this genome , like fold a piece of paper ,
We add some DNA structures , and I call the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Every one has a little bit of a _UNK_
And the other small part can be combined in the next place
And so many of these little DNA and long _UNK_
and put it into a shape like a rectangle .
And so far , we can &apos;t make this film .
At first , there was a long _UNK_ chain
And then we mix them together , and we mix them together .
And then you heat it and add a little salt
you heat it up to almost boiling and cooling it .
You can see a little bit of a spiral
but it &apos;s just a couple of _UNK_ _UNK_ together .
is because there &apos;s a little _UNK_ end and a spiral
So there &apos;s a couple of _UNK_ , and a spiral together
to show us all kinds of shapes and patterns we want .
And I want to do that in a shape ,
I want the DNA to go over the eyes .
to the nose , and then go back to the nose ,
And I &apos;m going to go back , like this whole circle ,
And I thought that if I could make this shape , everything else could be
And then I designed a computer program to design a small needle .
Put them together , heat it down again .
They &apos;re pouring in the water , and they &apos;re going to be clear
You have to find a surface that allows these _UNK_ faces
We &apos;re going to take the electrons in the microscope ,
And in a moment , it feels like the surface
You can see the surface a little bit _UNK_ .
Some &quot; _UNK_ &quot; are _UNK_ , but it &apos;s good for all .
You can continue to zoom in , and see more _UNK_ .
Now , the advantage of this technology is that anybody can do it .
I received something that was _UNK_ in the mail a year ago .
And the thing is that a Chinese graduate student
a very beautiful Chinese map , including Taiwan ,
And you can see a rope in the world , right ?
And besides the shape , you can also design different patterns .
You can do a map of America and _UNK_ DNA .
So , you can put the board on these _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
to get these things together , you can get a circuit board
And then you can put DNA into the board ,
This is some of my colleagues at Caltech .
They _UNK_ DNA , and they use organic molecules ,
to build a little switch here and see it around .
and it turns out that it &apos;s really a switch .
You need to build a computer , so we have a long _UNK_
because these are the ones that are _UNK_ for 10 percent
Now , I want to go back to the _UNK_ topic ,
The DNA &quot; can actually prove that the compiler can work .
You have a _UNK_ that says about the computer program
You can compile these molecules and send it to people
In fact , a company invented a very good program
a program that is much better than my ugly program .
This program allows us to do better design .
why DNA &quot; origami is not an end .
You have a molecule compiler , you can do anything you want .
So if you want to want DNA to create somebody
It &apos;s got about one percent of the sequence of DNA
If you zoom in , _UNK_ four kinds of DNA
If they match each other , these little pieces can be connected with other modules .
We use small squares to represent these modules .
If you look at them at the end of their _UNK_ , these little DNA clips
You can see that they can form a _UNK_ pattern .
So these little modules will be automatically built into a complex _UNK_ .
The key is that you may not notice
These little modules are actually like molecules .
_UNK_ into some modules , more exact , counting .
You can prepare some of the modules ,
When these modules are placed , they can form a binary counter .
You can read the five _UNK_ , six and seven
to make these kinds of calculations right now .
You need to type something , like a seed ,
They will start counting , when they read 32 times ,
So what we did was we found a way
to let a molecule know when to stop growing .
It knew when it stopped , because it could calculate
So this is the first question that I could ask .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us how babies do that .
Now , we can use this counting method to try
This is a DNA &quot; origami , what we can do
and you write a 32 _UNK_ on the left-hand side of the DNA .
And these modules , from these modules , new modules ,
to fill in the middle of the square
with the combination of DNA &quot; origami and modules ,
The ingenious thing is that it can be written again
by changing the DNA of a number of _UNK_
And in this case , if you keep the DNA ,
you can get a square in the first _UNK_ .
of the _UNK_ change , the single one , tiny mutations
And that &apos;s the question of Craig _UNK_ &apos;s care .
So , if you ask , how many _UNK_ DNA
If we want to build a 10 or 100 squares ,
We need a long time to have a square
we need 100 or 10,000 _UNK_ of DNA
We use DNA &quot; origami , and we can count the modules
that we just need 100 or 200 _UNK_ DNA
so we can reduce the amount of DNA
If we use a little bit of calculation ,
to reduce the number of molecules that need to build these things .
you can reduce the size of your genome ,
And finally , I went back to that .
Look at the square that &apos;s built by DNA ,
It &apos;s the pattern and you &apos;re going to build a memory pattern .
So if you put some wires and switches on the module ,
or put them on the module , rather than DNA ,
That kind of _UNK_ that you need in memory
You may ask , in this way , we &apos;ve gone to _UNK_ ?
In the experiments , this is what we did last year .
One , three , four , five , six , nine , 10 , 12 , 17 ,
It &apos;s _UNK_ , but at least the bigger the number
In fact , we had this idea nine years ago .
This is about the time that it has to be spent
I think we have a lot of progress .
We have ideas to _UNK_ these mistakes now .
I think that the five or ten years
we &apos;re going to make the square that I just described .
or you can do some of those _UNK_ circuits .
I want you to learn from my talk today ?
And what it does is the molecular computing form ,
in order to understand and make it better .
We &apos;re going to use molecules and _UNK_ these things .
But I want you to come from this talk
And these molecules are not just just building small tools .
and looked at the big problem with a new look at it .
? Imagine you &apos;re in a world without others ?
? Have you ever heard the sound of the face ?
? No one can listen to it ?
? Everybody has the freedom of change ?
? Everybody has the freedom of the world ?
? Or imagine a world that everyone feels _UNK_ ?
? Is there any reason for everyone to have a _UNK_ ?
? It &apos;s only true love that we know ?
? Everybody has the freedom of change ?
? You don &apos;t need to be a famous man ?
? to feel the power of your soul ?
? You don &apos;t need to be a big star ?
? to realize everything you see in your eyes ?
? You can change the world ? You can change the world ?
? I can change the world ? I can change ?
? She could change the world ? ?
? He could change the world ? ?
? You can , I can , she can , he can ?
? Can we change the world a little bit ?
? Every person can make a little change ?
? Everybody can change the world a little bit ?
is that when I think about the survival of _UNK_
And this song is why it &apos;s going to come .
I wrote a lot of _UNK_ songs for my first record ,
? No God saved the world &apos;s faith ?
? There is no man who has a Homo _UNK_ ?
? He just wants more , more , more , more ?
? More , more , more , more , more ?
? There is no free freedom of freedom ?
? There is no paradise , _UNK_ and _UNK_ ?
? No country , no religions , no religions ?
? More , more , more , more , more ?
So I want to share this idea with you ,
And when the new idea is going to come up ,
And since 1993 , I &apos;ve been in the world
One and in _UNK_ , my home , created the first estate company .
In 2003 , I _UNK_ the pure capitalist market
It is no coincidence for you to think of it .
And if you look at the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
The victim of the accident was entirely free of free .
And we were in this attack that we had
_UNK_ _UNK_ created a _UNK_ ambulance service enterprise ,
Since then , I worked with them to create two social enterprises .
I think we &apos;re doing something right at least .
The most important thing is that these funds are all qualified transactions .
And it &apos;s not the _UNK_ of charity .
and I &apos;m going to go back to the new type of exploration
_UNK_ and corruption are both sides of the demand .
He or she will not be up every day .
and said , &quot; Well , let me see who I am here today ? &quot;
or say , &quot; Look , I can make anybody cry . &quot;
It &apos;s often a situation that has to confront ,
And those unfortunate people are in the right place
In the world today , time is precious ,
Only can we pay the money to _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
Imagine you were asked to pay a _UNK_
How do you do that ? Of course , you can alarm at once .
What if the police department also _UNK_ the deep water tank ?
You don &apos;t want to pay for the stolen goods .
It &apos;s not enough to break a service like this ,
You can call them money and ask to fight against corruption .
And over the course of the last four years ,
And what she needed was a license ,
It can make her easier to get into the room .
But the official didn &apos;t want to give the permission
because I was busy building my own estate company .
I don &apos;t want to be _UNK_ by this nightmare .
a group of people in our group had once formed
in the 42 case of the _UNK_ ,
to achieve their purpose and not to use it .
And the cost of using these tools ,
I believe that these tools can be used
It &apos;s the charge that anyone who wants to serve .
The target market is an attractive and _UNK_ .
And there are two million dollars a year
It &apos;s never going to be a simple process .
_UNK_ by the biggest companies in India are committed to _UNK_ .
I was _UNK_ in the police department ,
But I think the cost of what we pay
It &apos;s worth building a more beautiful world .
And the _UNK_ were _UNK_ because they abandoned their bright future .
And I said , &quot; Well , we can &apos;t give up ,
It &apos;s just a _UNK_ . &quot; Thank you .
Chris Anderson : _UNK_ , the plan is very exciting .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ , hope not to open a opening will be finished immediately .
I mean , _UNK_ gives us some more intuitive view , like numbers , etc .
_UNK_ , how much money do you _UNK_ and how much money are ?
_UNK_ : Let me give you an example of this .
So we need to use the information rights ,
It seems like the American _UNK_ Act of _UNK_ ,
There is only such a way that _UNK_ the personnel .
&quot; Oh , what they &apos;re going to give them , I don &apos;t want to get the _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you &apos;re going to find trouble ? You know the _UNK_ in the toilet . &quot;
And then we had to take the next step ,
At least three times the case will be completed .
CA : That &apos;s really high . I love that !
_UNK_ : I was not going to talk about the TED stage .
CA : Well , these are the estimates , the actual difference .
If you &apos;re successful , you &apos;re going to be the hero of the world .
Thank you very much for sharing it with us at TED .
Obama called us for every one of us .
to get rid of the current financial crisis .
And _UNK_ , he didn &apos;t have a President Bush ,
and didn &apos;t tell us , &quot; We believe in the United States ,
Instead , he told us to put a _UNK_ thing on the side ,
And the word is not appropriate in such a future ,
This is a _UNK_ job in the hospital ,
And the thing that &apos;s written on this is common .
_UNK_ , clean up the garbage , stock stock stock , etc .
The number of these things may be a bit surprised ,
But in this case , there &apos;s a phenomenon that I want you to notice :
But there &apos;s no one that &apos;s involved in other people .
The _UNK_ work can also be done in a hospital hospital .
to understand how these people look at their work ,
Mike told them they didn &apos;t go on the floor .
because Mr. Jones got up to make a simple movement ,
trying to restore his _UNK_ , slowly moving up and down .
And _UNK_ told them that she didn &apos;t listen to her boss ,
because there are some family members there every day .
Now , some people are going to rest in the room .
_UNK_ _UNK_ a _UNK_ room for two times ,
because the patient &apos;s father , he &apos;s sitting here for six months ,
like this , whether it comes from _UNK_ , _UNK_ , nurses ,
At some time we were lucky , we would be doctors ,
Of course , the society is not so _UNK_ every _UNK_ .
But people who do that think they communicate with people ,
However , there is no words that are related to other people .
These _UNK_ will be the right to treat others .
In addition , they have moral skills to judge what is correct .
&quot; is the combination of the will and the moral skill . &quot;
A wise man knows how to do a particular treatment for every regulation ,
Like these _UNK_ know that when other people serve , they can &apos;t be relied on their own functions .
A wise man is like a jazz _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s not going to be completely _UNK_ when you &apos;re playing it ,
_UNK_ will be _UNK_ to the _UNK_ of the day .
A wise man knows how to use moral skills
for other people , not to deal with others .
You need time to understand the people you are serving .
trying to new things , often fail and learn from failure .
You also need a wise mentor to guide you .
When you ask those _UNK_ that I mentioned ,
and learn to do their work like that ,
They will tell you that you need a lot of experience .
They mean not that the floor needed a lot of time to accumulate ,
but to learn how to care about the care people need a lot of experience .
The good news is that _UNK_ becomes wise , you don &apos;t have to be smart .
It looks like a lot of other things you can do with others .
Otherwise , I &apos;ll tell you a little story again .
A father and his seven - year - old son saw Detroit in _UNK_ .
The father went to the store and bought it .
The father was completely _UNK_ of alcohol in the theory .
The child began to drink , and the guards found this ,
_UNK_ , quickly took the child to the hospital .
The emergency department then decided that the child had no alcohol in the blood .
and then you can let the kid go away .
The welfare of the children is not allowed to take away immediately .
The child was sent to a _UNK_ family for three days .
Of course , the judge said that the condition was his father left to the hotel .
&quot; We hate it , but we have to do the rules . &quot;
They brought a child back to a family full of _UNK_ and damage .
And when things were wrong , they did something wrong ,
We &apos;ll use two kinds of tools to fix it .
I can easily detect the response of the current economic crisis .
to improve incentive system , improve incentive system , or improve incentive system --
How are you going to write a rule that the _UNK_ have just mentioned before them ?
Can you give them a prize for their compassion ?
What happens when we do more _UNK_ systems ,
the rules and incentive system to make things happen in the short term ,
The moral skills have been _UNK_ by the rules ,
_UNK_ our desire to do the right thing .
The first is the conflict of rules and moral skills .
The students warned the danger of hot water .
_UNK_ 75 items in the class to teach a 25 - page page page .
And the whole _UNK_ of the Chicago _UNK_ ,
Every teacher said the same thing every day in the same way .
But they are in the position of teachers , and they are sure to make _UNK_ .
Most of them need to watch the musical score .
We need more terms to _UNK_ bankers , and God knew .
I &apos;ll give you the second reason to do the same thing .
Just in logic , two reasons seem to be better than one .
At some point , there are two reasons for doing the same thing ,
and they would make people don &apos;t want to do that .
Because the time is limited , I &apos;ll just give you an example .
People tried to decide where to deal with the _UNK_ .
Some _UNK_ go around , and there are some rich citizens of knowledge .
And they said , &quot; Do you want to put _UNK_ in your community ? &quot;
_UNK_ changed a little bit of the problem and asked others .
They said , &quot; If we pay you six weeks a year ,
Would you like to put _UNK_ in your community ? &quot;
Two reasons . This is my commitment and I &apos;m still _UNK_ .
So , don &apos;t you ask , &quot; What is my duty ? &quot;
When chief executives don &apos;t have a long time of health development ,
and looking for a great deal of dividends ,
And the truth is that you can &apos;t come up with
Any incentive mechanism can be _UNK_ by a _UNK_ will .
We need to _UNK_ . People are always going to live .
he would have lost his _UNK_ in this activity .
and it &apos;s going to make activity lose its own minds .
&quot; Are we going to ask &quot; _UNK_ ? &quot; Or are it right ? &quot;
people who work in this profession have become addicted to _UNK_ mechanism .
And of course , I can see these in the business world .
It was obviously not what people expected to work .
One way is , don &apos;t teach too much moral _UNK_ courses .
to show you not so serious , the best way to do that
that you &apos;re going to say about the moral standard packaging ,
To a small package with a butterfly knot , he took him as a moral lesson .
a very small sound will be talking to you
There will be ten - year - old children to do a _UNK_ .
you will find an excuse for your _UNK_ heroes .
You need those who teach you and praise the moral hero .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember this :
He was the boss of the _UNK_ _UNK_
He has 3000 workers , and he has left everyone to pay salaries .
Why ? Because if you leave them , for them , or for example ,
For the community , this will be an unfortunate disaster .
&quot; Maybe we don &apos;t have the value of Wall Street companies . &quot;
But I can tell you that it &apos;s more valuable than we can do it ! &quot;
At TED , we heard a couple of moral heroes .
You know , he made part of the evil Empire .
Why ? Because this is the right thing .
Why ? Because they &apos;re happy to do the right thing .
Yesterday , we heard the power of _UNK_ on the _UNK_ of Indonesia .
because it uses the will to do the right thing .
God also knows that this will use a lot of professional technology .
I was surprised how much he needed to know
is to make a lot of people know that part .
Unless people who work with you are behind you ,
There is no formula that tells you how people support you .
There are a lot of things in TED and other places .
The cleaning worker mentioned earlier was worth the ordinary hero .
As a _UNK_ , every one of us should work hard .
to encourage and raise moral skills and moral will .
and they would give up , if they were going to _UNK_ ,
If you &apos;re going to open the company , you &apos;re going to make sure
There &apos;s no work -- there &apos;s no work in it .
The work shows that the _UNK_ work is like before .
Any of you who are dealing with people
As a teacher , we should work hard to become ordinary hero ,
As a teacher has something we should remember .
and also provides a special set of _UNK_ .
He also talked about a lot of wonderful things
to get kids to the University of the city .
I want to focus on one of the things that _UNK_ are doing
And they found that this was the fact
is one of the most important things that kids need to learn .
The most important thing is that they need to learn respect .
If you do that , the rest of the _UNK_ _UNK_ down the landslide .
Girl : You teach kids how to do it .
You should _UNK_ all the things together every minute .
And I think the most _UNK_ we need is the wisdom of practice .
because he let other virtue -- honesty , kindness , courage and so on --
in the right time to show it in the right way .
I think anybody wants to be able to be good / _UNK_ .
And in a very large sense , this is what TED means .
And this wisdom is that every one of us
to build the organization that we work ,
to make sure that it &apos;s going to enable us to develop wisdom
Chris Anderson : You may have to wait for a walk there .
I think a lot of people have seen it .
And what it did was it was taken
He was in Vietnam in the last six years ago .
And before this photograph of 60 minutes of film ,
And he said , &quot; Well , he said ,
He has already got a hook with a stick to his arm .
And he took this new legs less than two hours ,
you can drink your drink , and it makes him feel excited .
It was the first time he felt his arm back again .
This is not the beginning of the story ,
I &apos;m not going to show you a fine video .
And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
and would not venture to do the advanced technology .
And they are now interested in people who can help the soldiers .
In short , I received a visit from the _UNK_ .
and I was sitting in my room at the time ,
They told me that a story , a _UNK_ ,
We &apos;ve been using the medical technology that we &apos;ve been very advanced ,
the most remote _UNK_ , the soldiers are able to
These _UNK_ will be found and brought back ,
than we were injured in a big city in the United States .
to get the first aid to get faster .
And the bad news is that if they bring people
and lost a arm , and a leg ,
Or part of the face , he was faced with the basic _UNK_ of life .
Then they showed me the number of people who lost their arms .
And then the doctor said , &quot; _UNK_ , &quot;
&quot; At the end of the Civil War ,
If somebody loses a arm , you know ,
We gave him a _UNK_ stick to replace it .
Why can we give him a hook with a hook ? &quot;
I was waiting for them to show me that it might be 500 pages .
&quot; We &apos;re going to take a guy out there ,
and give him the legs that you do ,
And then he or she can go from the table
So , you need a good motor control to make sure that _UNK_
The _UNK_ is bent , and the _UNK_ of the shoulder .
&quot; Oh yeah , this legs should be fit for _UNK_ &apos;s body structure ,
This arm should be fully _UNK_ , including power supply . &quot;
And they ended up doing it at the end .
more than 24 children are coming back .
And so that night I came home , and I started thinking about it .
However , I work a lot of my work during the day .
for me , such as water and water , and the dream of funding
I still think they &apos;re mad , but I decided to go on it .
I said I would give them a legs .
I said that the legs could be checked by the _UNK_ ,
It was like the apple had just launched the _UNK_ .
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll make a leg in a year .
but I need to make it work normally . &quot;
And then I started to _UNK_ up what I could find .
The best and interested in the people , the work team .
We have 14 degrees of legs of freedom .
If you make some _UNK_ on it , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s going to be a few _UNK_ ,
but that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
to make it really useful for it .
But in fact , you can see that
The shoulder on the side is completely _UNK_ ,
It took us ten hours in our office .
I &apos;ll show you a little bit about a minute ago .
_UNK_ did one of the things that I &apos;m still _UNK_ .
and put all the joints into the mouth ,
And there was no _UNK_ in the milk .
He _UNK_ the men of our control men .
It &apos;s not a simple thing to do .
Imagine how to _UNK_ a _UNK_ with a hook ,
Now , he &apos;s going to do the Defense Department .
He took up a seed and didn &apos;t have a _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things that we &apos;re starting to do
And we were sure that we had a good design ,
We need to do all the engineers to do .
Usually you can choose three of the things you want ,
For example , the weight , the size , cost , the functions are selected .
I took a bunch of people to the plane ,
I told them that we &apos;re going to _UNK_ Hospital , to talk to kids .
because , in fact , we don &apos;t like this arm .
And when I say , they &apos;re not interested in it .
But I said , how do they think a little bit more important .
The children will not use this arm .
I told my _UNK_ , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to _UNK_ Hospital ,
And there you see a lot of people
So we need to give them support and encourage ,
to make sure what we &apos;re doing now is correct .
When we went into Reed , I found myself _UNK_ .
There are a lot of people who lose their body ,
They were brought here , sitting on a table with us .
&quot; Look , &quot; I told them , &quot; We don &apos;t have a _UNK_ .
And we tried to make them tell us
We &apos;re going to help you . We need data , we need to know
And half an hour later , there was a guy sitting around the table ,
I told him , &quot; Hey , what do you say ?
If it &apos;s this or this , what do you want ? &quot;
He has a great spirit , and they all have .
After the end of the party , we went to all of us ,
And the man _UNK_ himself out of the table ,
And then we went to the _UNK_ Army Medical Center .
And we see a lot of these children , a lot of them .
And then I got a phone , and we went there .
And after 24 hours , they took him from Germany
He had a small part of his body ,
And I thought , &quot; How do I do that ? &quot;
Anyway , he was like all the rest of us .
These are not good things . If it happens to you ,
But every one of these people has experienced
And you know , this country is going to be
I don &apos;t have these problems . It &apos;s not every single one .
People who are born will get all the interests ,
It &apos;s a difficult problem . There are lots of opinions .
What are we going to do ? For those problems ,
I don &apos;t know how to answer it . But I &apos;m going to say ,
But nobody here is going to replace the legs
but it &apos;s not going to make the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I never saw a bird near the _UNK_ airport .
I &apos;m going to stop my work . I &apos;m going to stop .
And before that , I would have been doing it .
The complaints about our foreign policy are _UNK_ about .
but in our opinion we were _UNK_ about
Who should pay , how many of us have ,
to complain about the privilege of the _UNK_ .
great creativity , when necessary , we need great creativity
Talk about it . The great creativity is amazing , incredible , rational and _UNK_ power .
It can make the war a tragedy , and it makes it a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ can be a maker of culture , like all of our _UNK_ .
It &apos;s possible that we can point out the _UNK_ of _UNK_
science means intelligent , but great creativity is not _UNK_ .
The great creativity needs to be used in places where it works .
to _UNK_ us with a great idea to do different ideas .
Here &apos;s a idea that it comes from a _UNK_
_UNK_ : You know , today I &apos;m going to drive and walk
_UNK_ : He really selected walking , and the _UNK_ saw some interesting things
And those strange things that he had never seen
a leg _UNK_ and a fly _UNK_ .
a little bit of a _UNK_ wall with their bike .
And then he stopped . He was a woman in front of him .
That woman , as a child , had been wearing him
But she returned to the _UNK_ of his passion .
He called the Ford _UNK_ , which is her name .
&quot; I know it &apos;s 300 yards away , there &apos;s a tent near a _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s go there and do love it , just in that tent . &quot;
Ford took the clothes . She _UNK_ a leg and _UNK_ another leg .
_UNK_ went into her body , and she had sex with her .
And she took pictures for him , because she was a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And _UNK_ was because he decided to walk through the day .
Andy _UNK_ : We &apos;ve got science , we &apos;ve done the debate
to connect it up and make everyone want to act .
As a magician , I always tried to create a phenomenon
to do something that might not be possible .
And I was in 1999 in April ,
The next time I _UNK_ myself in a big ice ,
It &apos;s all over _UNK_ , and the place is New York City .
It was much harder than I thought it was .
Next time , I stood at the top of the _UNK_ ,
that the building behind me looked like a giant animal &apos;s head .
In London , I lived 44 days in a glass box
For me , this is the hardest time in all challenges ,
There was a lot of suspicion , especially in London ,
The next thing I want to do is to try and get my breath off ,
I was obsessed with _UNK_ and his challenges in the water .
When I was a kid , I started playing with other kids ,
About five times , I could stay underwater and never have to be _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been able to breathe for about 30 seconds ,
And then I found that it was a personal record .
and _UNK_ him and found that he had no brain damage ,
I think that if someone can do something ,
And I started thinking , if the boy had this boy ,
And there must be some ways that I can do it .
and ask other people how long it is ,
that even if the air doesn &apos;t work for me ?
He told me that any _UNK_ behavior over six minutes ,
The first time I &apos;m going to simulate the boy &apos;s case ,
the _UNK_ of the bones of the bones ,
When I was a _UNK_ . The first time I tried
So I realized that the simple simulation doesn &apos;t work ,
I was looking for a doctor &apos;s friend ,
and asked him how I could do it for a long time ,
&quot; I want to be underwater . How can I do that ? &quot; I asked him ,
to design a non - breathing _UNK_ that is more easy ? &quot;
He thought it would put this thing in my body ,
And then you can cycle the air through a certain way .
and put it in the water and put it in the face ,
It &apos;s basically what the doctors say , basically ,
There &apos;s no _UNK_ between my heart and lung ,
and then you put the tube into the artery ,
There is no breath , but in fact these devices are _UNK_ for me ?
And then I came up with a _UNK_ approach :
to really get to the point of the time ,
because they can only keep it in the water for four minutes .
And when I was looking at the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s almost the most amazing thing I &apos;ve found .
There &apos;s a deep record that people can get the biggest depth
is how long it would be to be ,
The first thing I learned is that when you &apos;re in _UNK_
should be _UNK_ , or you waste energy ,
and it &apos;s going to increase the CO2 content in the blood . So I &apos;m not trying to move .
I also learned how to slow my heart rate .
You have to make sure that the _UNK_ is very relaxed .
And then you feel a little bit _UNK_ ,
And then when you go back , it will be easy .
And I learned that I had to take a lot of breath ,
_UNK_ , relax , don &apos;t make a little bit out of it ,
_UNK_ and _UNK_ all the pains of the pain .
I woke up the first thing to do
I would use a way to _UNK_ my breath ,
and then it _UNK_ five and a half minutes ,
and then _UNK_ the breath for five and a half minutes .
I &apos;ll repeat the process of eight times .
In 52 minutes , I actually breathe eight minutes .
And at the end , I think the brain is going to go faster ,
It &apos;s like walking in a _UNK_ of light ,
It seems that I &apos;m part of what I &apos;m doing .
And this guy is like a _UNK_ of breath ,
So I must lose 50 pounds in three months .
Every little piece of food is _UNK_ to eat .
The more I &apos;m thin , the more I can breathe .
by using the _UNK_ of the food control ,
My heart rate goes down to 600 times a minute ,
I &apos;ve been able to breathe in four months .
and try to keep it in the extreme environment .
is it possible to reduce the heart rate
And finally I &apos;m going to break the world record ,
And the world record was about eight seconds ,
Tom , _UNK_ kept , and I told you that the guy had a _UNK_ lung .
I thought that could put a giant _UNK_ in the Lincoln Center
And then I didn &apos;t eat it for a week ,
And I &apos;m sure that this is going to happen
to help me get a little longer breathing .
I was in the middle of a week ,
and it feels that everything is going to orbit ,
And I didn &apos;t think about it , two days ago ,
They had to _UNK_ me out of control .
So the only way to get rid of the _UNK_
I told him that I was going to increase the stakes
I &apos;m going to breathe all the time .
And this is a different kind of recording ,
_UNK_ gave me four months ready and training .
I &apos;m going to sleep in the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
And every morning , again , from the _UNK_ ,
When I first tried to _UNK_ , I could have 15 minutes .
But when he came out , I was in good condition ,
And there was a guy who thought it was a big deal ,
is my girlfriend . When I first broke the record ,
And she was in the middle of my _UNK_ ,
My brother took a picture at the time . It was true .
And I finally announced that I was going to
Then his main competitor came out and _UNK_ the record again .
than what I did was to grow three minutes .
So , I &apos;m going to tell the story of science magazine ,
I want them to be involved in this ,
I don &apos;t know why magic is the faith of the _UNK_ Islands ,
and a story about the seriousness of the breathing .
When he was there , I tried to give him a deep impression
And so I flew down to 160 feet ,
It &apos;s about 16 floor , which is so high ,
And I was in the process of _UNK_ ,
I was completely trained to extend my time ,
but it &apos;s not going to be ready to broadcast television ,
In practice , I met _UNK_ , suspended in the water jar ,
But when they were on television , they wanted me to be around ,
So they had to hold my foot in a belt ,
And I had the legs to stand in the belt of that _UNK_ belt ,
And what I &apos;ve never done before is I &apos;ve got a heart attack ,
So every time you &apos;re _UNK_ , you hear the sound of the _UNK_ .
And I didn &apos;t have the way to reduce the heart rate .
And when I breathe it down to 12 minutes ,
And I thought , &quot; I had to slow my heart
the heart of the heart of the heart ,
It &apos;s just the same thing as the London Center failed ,
When I stick to half , it &apos;s about eight minutes ,
I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
I can &apos;t do it at all at all .
to do this underwater _UNK_ . If I get lost ,
It will become a show of how I fail .
At least they can _UNK_ what I was _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been stuck to 10 minutes , in the _UNK_ minutes ,
And in the _UNK_ , I started to _UNK_ ,
and the arm started to be _UNK_ .
I &apos;m a depression , and I remember everything that _UNK_ heart disease .
And then in _UNK_ minutes , it may be due to depression ,
down to 50 , from 150 to 40 , 20 , 150 .
and then I stopped . And I felt everything that happened .
I &apos;m very sure I &apos;m going to have a heart attack .
And so I _UNK_ the foot with a _UNK_
because I knew that if I had to leave the water ,
or a heart attack or a heart attack ,
They would start to release my foot _UNK_ .
_UNK_ me out . So I &apos;m very nervous .
I _UNK_ my foot , and I started to _UNK_ my body ,
I &apos;m just waiting for my heart to stop that moment --
You know they have a _UNK_ doctor
I think it must be a crazy thing ,
But I suddenly realized that I insisted that I had to go to _UNK_ !
And every audience here _UNK_ my energy ,
I insist on it , 17 minutes to 30 seconds .
Even if it wasn &apos;t enough , I was immediately out of it ,
They tried to extract the blood samples of the _UNK_
to test all the indicators and my status ,
I create the world record , and I hope
And I went to New York next day ,
There &apos;s a child coming up to me -- _UNK_ out of the apple --
And the child came to me and said , &quot; Hey , David ! &quot;
And he said , &quot; If you really have to go underwater ,
As a magician , I tried to show something
I think magic , whether it &apos;s going to be underwater ,
to do everything they can do in those _UNK_ moments .
This is a magic trick for me . Thank you .
If we question the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
So we have to take our own _UNK_
is to sit on this spirit and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
This is the key issue of our time ,
and look at the capitalist economy and democracy ,
They get 1500 dollars a day at the top ,
And the _UNK_ compassion , and the _UNK_ ,
the meaning of the world that we live .
So , if we want to have a world ,
I &apos;m not talking about two or two years ago ,
And I was almost unable to get any advice .
My colleagues in John _UNK_ are the best of all .
What kind of function do you have to have ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ , and I &apos;m writing a book about this .
We want to share more communication between each other .
And third , we can actually build a index ,
And what &apos;s going on in the _UNK_ , is it that we are satisfied ,
by controlling the tangible and the invisible asset management ,
I hope these problems will give me a chance .
I don &apos;t think we know how to deal with this .
If you look at this problem from Oxford in Oxford .
But the Oxford people are ready for a democracy ,
Now , in order to do that ,
The most _UNK_ form of capital is that
Money is not _UNK_ in many developing countries .
Now , we should be worried about problems ,
And the challenge is that the challenge is
Our education system is passed from the 19 th century .
in order to _UNK_ a project from the fundamental level ,
You just want to see the clean environment .
But you don &apos;t fully understand the corruption problem ,
And it was a very long time ago ,
to deal with the problems of government and state
and give the world a lot of poor people
_UNK_ _UNK_ : &quot; I &apos;m scared , you know ,
You ask me . You know I always give some answers .
You know , when I went back to Afghanistan ,
It takes three hours to travel around the city
So , first of all , when the standard measure ,
And the infrastructure is the simple kind of thing ,
is one of the most _UNK_ and _UNK_ powers ,
and thousands of people are trained to _UNK_ terrorists ,
I mean , I couldn &apos;t believe how much I was here ,
I thought I could get a chance of three years
You know , because I &apos;m going to give you a data .
you hear at least three _UNK_ channels every day .
the complexity of the complexity of the world .
You know , when I was back in 2001 ,
I don &apos;t want to work with the Afghan government .
I told them -- my people , and Americans --
Yes , I have a position in the U.N. .
Everybody told me that this is a different world .
This is crucial for the future of these ordinary people .
And the most common thing is that
What she care about is that there &apos;s plans for the future ,
She could have a different life in her children .
and the income is going to be _UNK_ ?
And instead of giving money to several security companies ,
the most _UNK_ company in the world ,
The legal rate of one thousand dollars per capita
If you want us to compete with Chinese competition ,
And we need to know that this is a _UNK_ .
for those who are engaged in small production
They don &apos;t want to sell it to the _UNK_ .
Yes , we have the best _UNK_ in the world !
Why can &apos;t we do the same thing in North Italy ?
The key question is how to think about it .
I &apos;m here to say aid is not used .
I was a _UNK_ ; after all , I had a lot of effort .
is equivalent to 20 dollars of aid ,
Second , one dollar aid may turn to 10 cents .
You know , the aid system started to reward .
And this is another assumption that
You know , I &apos;m very _UNK_ about my opponents --
You will not be able to keep the same opinion .
I &apos;m going to share with you the world in my eyes .
And I &apos;m going to suggest that we should be optimistic or _UNK_ .
And I &apos;ll tell you a secret , why would I be a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
We went from Al Gore , and some of you saw it ,
You &apos;ve seen the truth of &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; but this clip may make you feel more _UNK_ .
Because , according to our current knowledge , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
Even today , humans may have changed the planet &apos;s climate
every year , the factory and the CO2 emissions
the total amount of tons of _UNK_
And that makes the atmosphere more heat from the Sun .
It is estimated that the temperature of the _UNK_ is rising .
If this happens , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ will _UNK_ most of the Mississippi .
At that time , the tourists at the end of the glass will see the _UNK_ tower
We &apos;re going to meet the _UNK_ of climate
And then you see a lot of different organisms
After this , we should be happy , or should we be sad ?
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
I think at least I &apos;m going to go back to _UNK_
How do you judge what you &apos;re doing is correct or wrong ?
And the answer is , &quot; You have to think about the poorest
the most _UNK_ people who can &apos;t afford
and ask yourself if you do what you do .
_UNK_ , that &apos;s good . If this is not , you &apos;ll be _UNK_ .
And for those of us in this room , we should consider the poorest and most vulnerable
We &apos;re going to think about a whole community , culture and the world .
and people who live on the edge of our city
And this is , maybe it &apos;s going to make us feel _UNK_ ,
We &apos;re going to talk about these two aspects . First of all , from _UNK_ ,
Now there are two to three degrees of heat
This will lead to the rise of sea level , the water flow .
the biggest damage to poor people and _UNK_ .
At least in this decade , there will be no _UNK_
What we consume is so _UNK_ that we arrived at our _UNK_ ,
In June , there were _UNK_ _UNK_ living in cities and _UNK_ ,
The rural areas are no longer as much as they used to produce a lot of food .
It &apos;s also the _UNK_ , the sand storm , the _UNK_ ,
that could produce more food than 15 years ago .
Only last year , Africans eat _UNK_ to the wild animals .
Every _UNK_ of the jungle contains thousands of new organisms .
They &apos;ve never been monitored before , we don &apos;t know their genetic map .
Maybe they can be a new epidemic of _UNK_ .
What we &apos;re going to face is to be born in tropical areas , easy to spread all kinds of diseases .
Most of us have this growth . But this is the dark spot .
the _UNK_ and the rest of the world
_UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ the form of _UNK_ .
It &apos;s going to be with big winners and more _UNK_
The world is more _UNK_ than ever before .
One percent of the population has 40 percent of resources and services
If in the next 30 years , the population in poverty line
what &apos;s going to happen from a billion to three billion dollars ?
then one percent will have more than 40 percent of the resources and services
but because people in other parts of the world are getting worse .
Last week , Bill Clinton said in the TED award ,
The average day is that the force needs to be _UNK_ .
And we &apos;re going to have a positive crisis
And those emerging diseases will make H5N1 and bird flu .
They &apos;re just a bigger one . It &apos;s really a _UNK_ world .
unlike the _UNK_ events in the past , everything that &apos;s happening in the world is going to live through your desktop .
you &apos;re going to see the _UNK_ on television and cell phones .
For some people , it will mean anger , religion or _UNK_ , and terrorism .
But what does it mean to our social _UNK_ and entrepreneurs ?
and see the trend , we &apos;re getting too depressed , or getting _UNK_ ?
Let &apos;s take a look at the examples of Bangladesh .
And you can see those blue lines --
If the emission of greenhouse gas is completely _UNK_ today .
The most conservative estimates are 20 to 30 inches .
But the fact is that 10 times the time
What is this going to happen to Bangladesh ?
70 percent of the country &apos;s land level is only five feet .
And we &apos;re going to look at the Himalayas .
We look at the Himalayas because of climate warming . _UNK_ rain .
in the forest . In _UNK_ , the land will not absorb rain .
because the trees can absorb extra rain like straw .
Well , we look at the southern areas in _UNK_
I think many of you should have been there
And we &apos;ve been walking around until Bangladesh
We see what &apos;s going to happen here : the _UNK_ glaciers are going to continue .
At the same time , the _UNK_ water is rising .
and look at five rivers in Bangladesh .
and look at this three-dimensional image from south to south .
We &apos;ll find that the ocean is 20 to 40 inches
and the _UNK_ from the Himalayas . Look at this .
there will be 100 million refugees in Bangladesh
If you look around the world , look at the _UNK_ zone ,
you see that the sea level will change our lives .
whether it &apos;s in the Sahara or in our _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not just going to affect people in some remote regions .
It &apos;s going to happen in every one of us .
These names you never heard about 20 years ago : _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
And as the green _UNK_ between the _UNK_ animals are falling .
Can you imagine that 20 years ago , no one would have heard about _UNK_ hot !
And then we see the first case of infection in the United States
Do you know ? In those hundreds of people we &apos;ve heard about this virus ,
No one has heard of the virus !
is the first place in the animal , and to the human body ,
But we &apos;re going to look at the _UNK_ reason .
bad news ? It &apos;s enough . Humans always have a challenge .
Look at the list of the Nobel _UNK_ .
Did we ever meet the _UNK_ ? We were frightened to be scared , not .
But some people -- maybe some of you -- don &apos;t care about it .
is to create a organization like the _UNK_ Society ,
And there was doctors , and it inherited the tradition of our rescue .
And the International _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , his hope and optimistic
And there &apos;s a little bit of a _UNK_
We might see polio _UNK_ this year .
In the last year , there were 2000 cases in the world
Next year , maybe we can see New Guinea _UNK_
Now there are only _UNK_ cases in the world .
20 years ago , there were _UNK_ people infected with this virus
We also know some new infectious diseases that are happening in the past 30 years .
and looked around , we saw a lot of young people
But the way they spend money is that their parents never thought about it .
They don &apos;t wait until the front door came to _UNK_ Foundation .
They &apos;re putting their own money , resources and _UNK_
You can say , no other thing can give you a bigger emotional emotion .
And in the &apos; 60s , I grew up
We all think we &apos;re part of it , we think that a better world
What we create is a world that has no tolerance , violence and prejudice .
Today , we see another movement . The movement aims to save the Earth
five weeks ago , a group of active people from _UNK_
to prevent the _UNK_ building of nine coal power .
six months ago , it was an active person
Al Gore gave a _UNK_ at the _UNK_ State
And we see that science and religion go together
because they all see the _UNK_ of climate
Now there are 4,000 church members in the _UNK_ .
It allows us to see the dawn of the _UNK_ .
In April , it will be a _UNK_
There are thousands of people in the United States
_UNK_ , supporting legislation about preventing climate warming ,
I knew yesterday , July _UNK_ , around the world ,
And you can even feel the atmosphere of the air
But all this doesn &apos;t mean they understand a little bit .
All of this is just the first step
But I also saw some big foundations , like _UNK_ Foundation .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and Google Foundation
are starting to realize a little bit about
that we can &apos;t struggle with climate warming alone .
And it &apos;s going to be ready for climate warming .
But for me , I have other reasons to be optimistic
You hear a lot of interesting stories here , I heard a lot last night .
And I want to share with my own story .
I lived in the Himalayas , _UNK_ and a very smart person
And one day , he took me to the temple and told me ,
My mission is to work for the World Health Department .
And there was no kind of project at that time .
And today , we did this goal , and it made me feel optimistic .
in the last century -- seven years ago ,
and the death of any other _UNK_ disease ,
In the summer , two million people died because of smallpox .
When you read the Bible , you read the chapter of _UNK_ , you should know smallpox .
_UNK_ is because of the death of smallpox .
In order to _UNK_ smallpox , we called the biggest troops in the United Nations .
We went to the door of India and asked if there were smallpox , and they had two hundred families .
We &apos;re going to _UNK_ a key moment in smallpox .
This is what you should learn as a social entrepreneur should be at the final point .
When we &apos;re going to kill smallpox , it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ .
And unfortunately , they &apos;ve been infected with smallpox in a place
_UNK_ took the virus to the other 10 countries ,
But we finally win , the last case of smallpox :
It was this girl who called _UNK_ , who lived in Bangladesh ,
When she was coughing , she would end up with a _UNK_ .
The virus falls on the ground and is burned by the sun .
That means that the worst virus in history is _UNK_ .
This virus is only about thousands of people in India ,
And there &apos;s a lot of people who are blind .
For us , the most important thing is that we have a relationship
The doctor , the medical worker , who worked with him ,
We don &apos;t have to deal with the enemy ; we &apos;re not _UNK_ .
Isn &apos;t it going to make you feel confident about the future ?
But it &apos;s not the _UNK_ that we usually talk about .
And what I want to talk about is that
whether it &apos;s going to work through agriculture ,
So I want to take you through a evolutionary _UNK_ ,
And then I &apos;m going to talk to you about the last few
And for us , for our race , for example ,
and what &apos;s going to happen to our civilization ,
Now we &apos;ve actually changed for a long time .
There is no dog on the planet in the environment .
But we had to use a very hard way
And we don &apos;t have to do that again .
to try to get it to a camel .
They &apos;ve been using it in some situations .
the largest _UNK_ animal in the world --
In fact , it has been seen in the wild environment .
No one was modified ; they were real creatures .
And we &apos;ve got one of these technologies
Well , they &apos;ve been extracted from this gene , this _UNK_ gene ,
Once they can apply in the cell , they can also be used on organism .
So , the _UNK_ showed that orange mouse had green .
And if you can make it work on monkey --
although from monkey , it was actually about genetic operation
And they may come up with the _UNK_ ,
And that means they can make it work on humans .
that we can be able to do this for a long time
You can go out and buy _UNK_ pets .
These are _UNK_ . They are black and silver .
These _UNK_ have been _UNK_ by the genes .
They &apos;re actually buying some states in the state right now .
No one knows how to do this _UNK_ .
There &apos;s no relevant sector -- it &apos;s not in environmental or food regulatory --
So some states decided to allow them to ,
Now the food regulatory has tried to make the final decision
about whether you can eat this fish --
Most of the food you buy in the supermarket
We &apos;ve allowed it to go into this country -- different from the European Union --
You might remember the same researcher in the South scandal ,
Because he claims he has _UNK_ human cells , he &apos;s not .
It &apos;s a hard job to _UNK_ the dog ,
because a lot of the horses that are important
In other words , let them become _UNK_ organs .
You can have a horse at the same time .
to make drugs and other drugs from the body
from the Institute of _UNK_ in Korea ,
In fact , they use these kinds of _UNK_
And then let the cow give the baby a _UNK_ .
There are two kinds of DNA in our body .
It &apos;s a problem that if we define the species ,
is to put electrodes into the central and the brain
It may be closer than this -- or maybe it &apos;s better than that .
This is the fact that _UNK_ is an important --
They put this computer on the back of their backs ,
they can fly this creature around the lab .
They can let it go left . They can stop it .
They land on the ground , and they landed on the ground ,
Then they shut down all the equipment and they fall down .
But this is the latest height they can land .
In fact , this technology has been so developed
So when this moth became a moth ,
They just connect it to their technology ,
and the electrode is about half the brain ,
There &apos;s a camera on the head of it .
They can get it through the Maze and control it .
the computer can monitor their brain , when they move ,
and especially when they &apos;re in their right hand .
And then they connect it to a arm ,
Soon , computers learn how to read the _UNK_ wave ,
monkey realized what she did with her hands ,
And finally she would move around and move ,
and he would come up with another room ,
has become a world of history that has
This is the _UNK_ of Florida University .
These are just the neurons that are _UNK_ in mice --
This is the _UNK_ , the brain is in this --
and using this brain as a single processor ,
And when you turn it to the _UNK_ ,
But the fact is that it &apos;s a completely _UNK_ brain .
there &apos;s more than less _UNK_ human skin ,
And there &apos;s a _UNK_ that supports the ear .
And this creates the ear of the mouse
He took a real cell , using DNA _UNK_ to read it ,
Another cell chromosomes are not the same as the first cell --
This is a computer in the history of the world .
is going to turn into something like this .
But in fact , this is not what _UNK_ looks like .
with a tags A , T , C and G --
So we need to ask ourselves some questions .
as the first time in the history of the planet
if we would decide whether we would choose pets
I want it to _UNK_ the head of the dog ,
using them , blood , blood , and _UNK_ ,
We &apos;re not just using it in the body ,
What we &apos;re saying now is to control our evolution .
and the responsibility of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
because it &apos;s going to have any organisms in the future .
His parents gave him a great deal of support and concern .
He set on the _UNK_ and began a rather unusual expedition .
His great book -- the origin of the species ,
and even a little bit of a _UNK_ .
In the whole book , only one word of words .
&quot; The origin of human beings and history
He also has a little interest in the distribution of color .
In fact , he was in the _UNK_ of _UNK_
&quot; There is a lot of differences between people and people ,
and the color is the most significant .
one of the wonderful things that NASA did
to detect what &apos;s interesting in our surrounding environment .
to collect data on the surface of the planet .
is that every year the world receives ultraviolet radiation .
And the research of human color is critical .
or don &apos;t want to be aware of it ,
So when we study the skin of the human brain ,
and the color of the color of the current situation ,
with the skin of the dark skin .
We face the impact of a lot of ultraviolet radiation .
However , it also _UNK_ the production of _UNK_ in the skin .
_UNK_ is a kind of element that we need ,
to help us with strong bones and strengthen immune systems ,
The black pigment is likely to exist in different forms .
and also prevent _UNK_ acid from being _UNK_ .
is starting to move around to other places ,
In winter , when you were in the _UNK_ ski ,
_UNK_ is unable to build _UNK_ in your skin .
the potential to produce _UNK_ in the skin .
to make sure that the health of itself
The human migration has been taking a long time .
And what you see here is that in the past ,
And that led a lot of the _UNK_ social phenomenon ,
We are so clever that we can be completely _UNK_ .
but they don &apos;t have a good time to convey people
There &apos;s a lot of problems in the body ,
We have the first non - _UNK_ , elected as President of the United States .
What he means is a big meaning is _UNK_ .
But we still need to think carefully about his skin .
and how different people on the planet are .
And once you &apos;re exposed to sunlight , their skin _UNK_ ,
They are also facing the danger of _UNK_ .
So when people ask you , &quot; What is the evidence of evolution ? &quot;
You don &apos;t have to name those _UNK_ or fossil examples .
He had _UNK_ the influence of climate on human color .
You can see all the evidence we have today , he can understand .
And in a sense , it &apos;s weird to me ,
And today , I want to show you
And there are some other things that are really true .
If you want to call it its weight , it &apos;s very easy .
When you eat it , you care about weight .
I &apos;ve been looking at these things for a long time .
This is very rough , this is kind of smooth , very smooth .
But in fact , it &apos;s completely wrong . There &apos;s no such thing .
They may be the mountain , and perhaps only a formula , it &apos;s _UNK_ .
It was a very _UNK_ , but now there &apos;s nothing .
Why ? Because the actual size of the lung
for whales and small _UNK_ for animals ,
And there are some of the right _UNK_
And the rules of the rules are often
And finally , you &apos;re going to get something like this .
and a new math from pure human mind .
It &apos;s going to be an extraordinary period in the world .
of some of the things that nature has .
The figures are simply a mathematical joke about it .
And when I first told my math friends ,
They said , &quot; Don &apos;t be silly . That &apos;s just a number of times . &quot;
He didn &apos;t know math ; he didn &apos;t have math at the time .
He is Japanese and has no contact with Western culture .
But his paintings have been cut off for a long time .
I &apos;m going to talk about it for a long time .
I read Mr. _UNK_ &apos;s book about his tower .
And what he knew was that it was amazing to me .
I was _UNK_ by a lot of things in my work ,
and every one of these things is familiar with .
&quot; Well , the thing is -- &quot; I said , &quot; Stop ! &quot;
They went together to study and had this proof .
So they got a math prize for _UNK_ ,
is one of the three major _UNK_ ,
And you always ask me what I &apos;m talking about ,
What you see on the left is the long-term data .
You see it &apos;s a very _UNK_ theory .
It &apos;s easy to write a lot of books about it .
You have to be able to -- how do you say ?
For 50 years , people have a little look at me ,
But I tell you that at this point , people listened to me .
You don &apos;t have any good _UNK_ to do it .
The other factors of five _UNK_ are the same important .
The _UNK_ should not be put on the side .
And if you don &apos;t have that , you know ,
Now , I &apos;m going to talk about the last thing ,
It was a story of my life in a sense .
My uncle was a very famous mathematician who told me ,
This is a guy named _UNK_ and _UNK_
like thousands of people who have tried before ,
For example , this is a new question --
that people don &apos;t fully understand the numbers .
If you want to _UNK_ them , you have to choose some systems
and a pilot found this in the flight .
_UNK_ knew that there was a small country on the Himalayas ,
and decided to make a different kind of thing .
After all , happiness is not only the privilege of _UNK_ ,
What do you do , buy , what you sell ?
Who has the right to express it ? How do we reflect it ?
One of the ways to _UNK_ is through the market .
The great Indian economists , _UNK_ , had won a Nobel Prize ,
because he proved that the _UNK_ of famine and food
but the ability to get food out of it
or someone has the right to get food in the market .
And one of the things that happened in 1984
the biggest crime in humans , nearly a million people die of hunger
In the south part of the country , there was actually _UNK_ food ,
but people in northern Africa cannot get access
And in general , most of the African farmers
And in the area of their land is _UNK_ ,
In the number of funds they can _UNK_ , they have very small farmers ,
Now Africa is one of the most _UNK_ countries in the world .
In Africa , only 7 percent of the land area was _UNK_ .
The farmers in Africa are using 22 kg of _UNK_ ,
The road density in Asia is six times bigger than in rural areas .
The _UNK_ of Latin America is eight times bigger than Africa ,
Asia &apos;s _UNK_ is three times more than Africa .
There &apos;s no choice in Africa today in Africa ,
And when he _UNK_ , he came to the market with hard work ,
but it &apos;s the lowest price of prices ,
And the price is the highest , the ones we call
the corner -- the food is _UNK_ --
But she had no choice to buy her family .
The real problem is that the market in Africa should develop
In _UNK_ , she won the Nobel Prize because she _UNK_ farmers
more Nobel Prize can also understand , farmers want to get
In the market they _UNK_ , they wanted to make money , as anyone else .
One thing is clear : at least we all know
20 years ago , the world insisted on Africa
The market must be _UNK_ and the economy must be adjusted .
Our farmer became the _UNK_ businessman ?
Probably because we all know , in fact , Africa is the only place
is expected to be hungry and _UNK_ in the next decade .
_UNK_ , and the use of fertilizer is not only increasing , but reduce .
And I took 15 years to look at it ,
from 10 to 15 African countries in Africa ,
trying to understand where our market reform is wrong .
For me , this reform seems to me
and the risk of trade in rural agriculture market
The _UNK_ of Africa is not only because of the infrastructure
like the highway and the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ , because
And the lack of the market organization , for example ,
And so , the goods sell are often available in small quantities ,
In the spirit of _UNK_ and trust , the human spirit is _UNK_ to deal .
And so , as the grain _UNK_ --
And I &apos;ve calculated that from farmers to consumers
You need to pass the four times , five times .
And every time I see this happening in the entire rural areas --
And then _UNK_ said to me again , I really realized that there was only this ,
and people knew that they had the goods .
of the number and the quality of the world .
For example , the market is on the price signal .
I calculated that the industrial companies in _UNK_
It &apos;s just because there &apos;s nothing to do
for most of the small farmers in Africa ,
They came to the market almost _UNK_ , a little bit of information .
or any of the recent local markets they know
They have less price than they have , and they have less risk .
And the risk is that we &apos;ve seen Africa &apos;s food prices
is the most _UNK_ of the world .
In Africa , small _UNK_ is a risk of _UNK_ .
In fact , in my opinion , there is no history in the world
will expect farmers to withstand the aid of African farmers .
In my opinion , there is no local agriculture in the world .
is to build the farmers in Africa today .
In Ethiopia , for example , the price of corn
and it &apos;s about five _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
And the risk of this market is _UNK_ ,
And it &apos;s not just going to invest directly
The encourage policy of high productivity is directly influenced by modern seeds and fertilizer ,
for you , for example , in the last two years ,
The farmers in Ethiopia have a great harvest .
But _UNK_ , because the market is weak .
The price of the corn has led to 80 percent .
It made no profit for the farmers who _UNK_ corn .
And we could say , in 2002 , _UNK_ tons of grain
was left in the field and had been _UNK_ .
In June six months , Ethiopia announced a serious food crisis ,
_UNK_ close to 1984 - the year - old population faces _UNK_ .
And in the rain there was a lot of rain ,
_UNK_ the fertilizer market , not use the fertilizer .
In fact , the amount of _UNK_ is reduced .
or an example of a _UNK_ green revolution .
I &apos;m not here today to _UNK_ this sad case , not to complain about it .
I came here to tell _UNK_ that change has been _UNK_ .
Today Africa is not waiting for other people to aid Africa ,
The government is going to _UNK_ out of the market .
We now realized that we had to take the market _UNK_ ,
the price _UNK_ , and it &apos;s going to invest in the right infrastructure .
The condition of release the market will be _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ in Africa has been ready to _UNK_ ,
About three years ago , I decided to leave my comfort work ,
but to go back to my birth , Ethiopia ,
_UNK_ , learning and trying to persuade decisions and _UNK_
I think it &apos;s time to be a _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been _UNK_ in Ethiopia and led a very exciting new activity ,
is to establish the first _UNK_ of Ethiopia .
In fact , in 18 _UNK_ corn traders and farmers
The town of _UNK_ and _UNK_ in _UNK_ ,
trying to build a better way of trading .
And the _UNK_ of Chicago is the beginning of this ,
It is now the most famous commodity exchange in the world .
We hope our farmer will benefit from the exchange of the goods today .
In the American _UNK_ , farmers used to ship corn into _UNK_ ,
But once the goods are worth _UNK_ , if there is no buyer ,
Or suddenly the price is falling , the farmer will suffer a big loss .
In fact , farmers even _UNK_ the corn ,
and don &apos;t want to spend more money on the farm .
People need to avoid the risk and the big loss .
and we &apos;ve created the market of futures ,
And the basic system of grain _UNK_ and acceptance --
to build on the basis of the completion of the transaction .
from here , the greatest innovation of the market ,
The buyers and _UNK_ don &apos;t need to be seen , don &apos;t need to _UNK_ ,
and can also be able to sell grain .
That means that grain trade can go through a long distance ,
or even through time -- to make 18 months later .
This activity is the core of the U.S. agriculture ,
It &apos;s also from a local town to international market ,
Agriculture market , the main reason for the big country .
We think that the _UNK_ of the goods
And cotton , coffee , the reference price of the _UNK_ ,
is actually in the northern countries that have _UNK_ .
is a shift from market to emerging markets .
In the last century , you can see the share of the Western _UNK_
that the United States has the share of the globe .
only half of the last 20 years have dropped .
In the same way , this was done in India , for example ,
that the rural farmers in the _UNK_
and over the last three years of _UNK_ .
They are actively connected farmers to lead them into markets .
which is 2004 , replaced the _UNK_ of Chicago ,
Now , in Ethiopia , we &apos;re also designing
We &apos;re not going to go to Chicago or something
And the pattern of India is going to be
So the _UNK_ is the _UNK_ of Ethiopia .
We are building the system for all market _UNK_ .
to make small _UNK_ to deal with the risks I talked about .
The design of the _UNK_ of Ethiopia
The _UNK_ _UNK_ basically established the entire ecosystem ,
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
And one of the things that we &apos;ve learned in Africa over the last 20 years --
a _UNK_ is going to develop information about the market ,
Another person is going to _UNK_ or continue to perfect level and standards ,
Some people have to do information and communications , but other people invest in warehouse or _UNK_ .
And that means that the _UNK_ will run a trade system ,
Because we think the country has no ready for all electronic trade .
But at the same time , we &apos;re going to do something
There &apos;s nothing to do in the world , that &apos;s in the countryside .
can come to our terminal , and we call
people don &apos;t have to buy computers or figure out how to dial up the Internet ,
or the question like that , they just need to look at
And at the same time , it &apos;s pretty important for this market ,
and it &apos;s a little bit of a _UNK_ that we designed .
is that the _UNK_ will run around the country ,
_UNK_ the grade certificate and warehouse _UNK_ can be finished .
In contrast , we will run a internal _UNK_ system
It will be finished on the course of time .
So basically , we &apos;re building trust and honesty in this system .
We also have the foundation of _UNK_ and laws --
A legal framework that enables the entire market to operate well .
What &apos;s really important is that _UNK_ will run a market information system ,
to convey real estate prices in the country ,
and using the _UNK_ _UNK_ technology to give farmers
_UNK_ are often able to think about local farmers ,
that he or she would just go to the local market recently ,
They don &apos;t know any idea of _UNK_ or any other concept --
The farmer now knows the price of the national market .
And they began to think about the country , and even international market .
They are not only starting to make decisions in business markets ,
and make decisions , according to the price of futures ,
And they came to the market , and they knew what the hierarchy
It will also change the way the traders do business .
This will prevent them from doing simple _UNK_ , limited trading ,
and make them really focused on how to take grain
_UNK_ areas are _UNK_ through long distances to supply poor areas .
We believe that this is a powerful political decision ,
And we &apos;re going to combine with financial departments , and information and communications ,
We believe that the change has been _UNK_ here , and we can totally do it .
The last meeting in our century was our president .
and announced this to the country in the country
_UNK_ can also become the market of _UNK_ .
The domestic market value of Ethiopia is about a billion dollars .
And we expect that in the next five years ,
If Ethiopia had 40 percent of their domestic market ,
and only 25 percent of market value , the market value will double .
And in fact , Ethiopia was the second largest corn in Africa .
We think we have the value of success
So we found our joy and happiness in the cause .
This is the scale of the Great Wall of China ,
But the parts of it are not visible , or almost invisible ,
Some sand and then natural stone form the rock .
With the _UNK_ of the rocks , the new sand forming .
But the mountains moving are dangerous . I &apos;m going to explain why .
More than a third of the land on the earth is in _UNK_ areas .
We found sand in the south of the Sahara .
This is the most closely connected area of _UNK_ .
which is in the early &apos; 60s and early &apos; 70s ,
and over 70 percent of agriculture in the world are affected .
And the question is that we &apos;re going to ask ourselves ,
looking for the answer to the answer .
The _UNK_ moves at about 600 meters a year .
The Sahara is almost going to eat a meter a day ,
I &apos;m here -- the second one on the left --
So , they moved the whole village in a room .
It took us ten minutes to climb the top of the _UNK_ .
That means why they have to move to a safer place .
If you happen to live in a place near the boundary of the desert ,
And you can calculate that there &apos;s a lot of times
_UNK_ your house and your life , as you know .
Now , the _UNK_ covers us about a fifth of the _UNK_ .
But if we want to stop the _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ up to build the Sahara Wall .
is to grow a _UNK_ _UNK_ in West .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
If you want to stop moving the _UNK_ ,
you have to make sure that you can stop the _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s a great way to do it .
But the trees are faced with a problem ,
Now , besides the trees and expect them to be cut off .
I did three things from the nature of the rock .
and put them together in the water .
It provides physical support for the survival of trees ,
They can take care of these trees , protect them from human beings .
It &apos;s a little bit like a _UNK_ architecture ,
What we need is just part of the _UNK_ needs ,
and it allows us to help us .
and the wind pulls the _UNK_ up .
and then _UNK_ our surplus into the ground .
How am I going to take a sand _UNK_ ?
How do we bring the _UNK_ together ?
The answer is , maybe , you can use these guys ,
These pictures from the American _UNK_ showed us this process .
What happens is that you put _UNK_ on _UNK_ ,
It began to fill the gap between the sand .
I learned this from a professor at the University of California .
He had finished the experiment in the _UNK_ minutes .
In this case , I played the role of this crazy scientist ,
But I did a -- literally -- the _UNK_ --
It looks like a cubic meter of _UNK_
It &apos;s going to cost us 90 dollars .
At first we need to buy bacteria for 60 dollars ,
The first is to create the structure of a balloon ,
It &apos;s filled with bacteria , and it &apos;s _UNK_ it with sand ,
_UNK_ it , is to take the bacteria out to cure it .
The second option is to use the _UNK_ .
We put the _UNK_ into the sand _UNK_ ,
and then take these _UNK_ out of the _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to be the mold ,
We can almost create any shape that we want .
So we have a way to turn sand into a _UNK_ ,
can create the space of _UNK_ in the interior .
Well , my architecture is kind of exciting , it &apos;s based on the _UNK_ formation ,
It looks like this , it &apos;s a model of it .
These are the caves that I built in the state of _UNK_ .
I realized that if I stack them up like fish scales , they could offer me
whether the temperature or the rest of the matter .
Now , in the normal control , the structure of these structures
I think it really creates a global beauty .
And there are some things that are going to happen
We see the desert with _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is the result of the human being ,
that the bacteria will kill anything they meet .
This is a natural process . It &apos;s now in nature .
Once we stopped feeding bacteria , they would die .
At the end of this century , the world could lose
_UNK_ that we are looking forward to the desert .
If there &apos;s nothing else , I &apos;d like to start a discussion about this plan .
But if I wanted to make a wish at TED ,
It &apos;s a long way , but it &apos;s very narrow desert _UNK_ ,
And finally , I want to show you a simulation of this structure ,
and I &apos;ll give you a word of _UNK_ .
but we have to think of sand as a stone . &quot;
Now , many details of this plan have to go further ,
My design -- is going to lead you into &quot; _UNK_ &quot; --
I was born in _UNK_ , and now living in the United States .
We think they &apos;re the key to modern life --
I guess you might call it a consumer life model .
I needed to create a sustainable farm and a career
with the local cycle of materials that can be used for a long time ,
I found that I could only make these tools .
At present , we have completed eight samples in 50 machines .
At the same time the hardware is starting to grow .
is because the hardware has changed the lives of people
If we can reduce agriculture , buildings and manufacturing _UNK_ ,
We can inspire the great potential of human beings .
In my opinion , this is just a beginning .
to use the open hardware technology of open hardware
and asked them some questions , and they said ,
He had to explain that he was not talking to them .
You see , this is what happened in the world .
And although the result is that there &apos;s nothing to do ,
unless we were the first civilization of evolution ,
We should have some of the evidence that aliens exist .
However , we know that we are lonely .
And then the _UNK_ continues to use this silly logic
Anyway , I &apos;m going to point out that _UNK_ may be
a scientist who didn &apos;t know where to come .
And then it changed human history . This is not _UNK_ ?
And if _UNK_ was a real alien at the time ,
And why don &apos;t he get to the point
They thought the alien had been visiting and had been _UNK_ by thousands of years ago .
If you believe that this thing is going to happen .
and bring us to the pyramid to sexual intercourse .
They always stick to the _UNK_ and connecting the aliens
It &apos;s a summer , just catch up with &quot; Third _UNK_ . &quot;
I went to a _UNK_ holiday in New Jersey with my parents .
So I went to the rest of my holidays ,
It &apos;s basically going to sit outside our _UNK_ at night ,
Their neck soon _UNK_ , so they left the pavement .
I was very good at the game , but I wasn &apos;t good at it ,
And I think they have over 70 times ,
And I think they &apos;re going to date
because he was dressed in a neat suit
because she wasn &apos;t in the middle of the night , she wore a wool coat ,
The _UNK_ _UNK_ from the surface of the sea .
And then they stopped , and the man turned to it ,
You have to admit that this old man was dating
The old man stopped at the _UNK_ of his girlfriend .
&quot; The alien is not there , &quot; she said .
I can &apos;t hear the sounds of the sea .
I don &apos;t know why they &apos;re going to make me laugh .
What is it in the back of the mask ?
And it made a gesture of shooting a gun ,
Now , you can think of this as a simple mistake --
a girl _UNK_ with me and looked at it --
I realized that it was impossible to look at the surface --
I was with my friend Tim Tim _UNK_ to see , he sat on my left .
She has a long _UNK_ , her hair , blue _UNK_ .
I remember , her foot was kind of injured ,
I was a _UNK_ . I thought she should be _UNK_ ,
But I never met him . She didn &apos;t go to our school .
I don &apos;t know her name , I know she &apos;s not good .
She sat with a guy like her mother ,
They &apos;re all _UNK_ , mom and her daughter --
because I never read the novel before .
But she asked a lot of questions :
There &apos;s nothing , like she doesn &apos;t mind the answer ,
as if she just wanted to talk to me .
I don &apos;t know what to say . I &apos;m going to say . &quot;
I don &apos;t need to remind you that the film is David _UNK_ ,
There is a character called the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And the big pond is _UNK_ from orange .
He was able to radio through an old radio
to the world , but never reach them .
I mean , I like them to be better than _UNK_ .
and went out of the theater in a hurry .
It seems that she was still _UNK_ with me .
And when I say that , it sounds funny ,
And this is a community outside the planet .
to hide some _UNK_ -- after the alien _UNK_ ,
So I didn &apos;t slow up to talk to her .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;ve never seen her again .
And there are some strange things that are going to happen
He didn &apos;t remember what happened 10 minutes ago ,
even ten hours , ten days of the day .
And the conclusion is that when the aliens
The picture is provided by a _UNK_ Joseph ,
This is a very good film topic .
I remember , the film showed a lot of detail .
_UNK_ : The _UNK_ of aliens is a rubber mask .
The long sequence of rubber mask for the movie ,
in all the big movies in Pennsylvania .
The film is based on the _UNK_ of communication .
_UNK_ events ? _UNK_ things ? What &apos;s wrong with the photographs ?
Now , I can &apos;t answer it now .
We climbed to the roof and drank _UNK_ .
What ? What do we do ? Is there any people doing this ?
It was thought that the world ended up .
where I was _UNK_ by the wild dog ,
And the last dog _UNK_ my ass ,
They went to a strange _UNK_ clinic .
The _UNK_ wants to go to the beach to a circle .
She said to go to the beach and take a bus
I was tired of the bad _UNK_ , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to go . &quot;
I remember her _UNK_ eyes as she left .
Her eyes are bright bright blue and final .
a single woman alone to a strange country ,
to a beach where she didn &apos;t know where she was .
I &apos;ve _UNK_ my mind for a while .
It &apos;s not long before , it &apos;s almost time for supper ,
I was upset , so I went to her on the street .
I couldn &apos;t call her because it was 1991 ,
At that time the alien _UNK_ gave us this technology .
or she &apos;s not going to come back again .
I didn &apos;t look at the sky , but at the end of the street ,
How much hope they can let me see your face .
In a small town in the town of _UNK_ ,
I really appreciate the _UNK_ of the universe
five young people -- they all have fun people ,
to go back to their homes and their homes .
one named Joseph , who asked me what I did ,
He said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , &quot; he &apos;s sure he &apos;s safe .
The next two hours , they wait with me .
They come to my room in turn to me ,
At this time , there was a _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
She was _UNK_ , and she didn &apos;t know why I was sad .
They had a lot of relief in their laughter .
They were _UNK_ to us , and they returned to the room
Let &apos;s take a hand out of the street alone .
And it &apos;s like the pain in memory ,
And even though now , 15 years later ,
I never found her in the room at any time .
And I think you &apos;re going to agree with ,
is _UNK_ by aliens and even _UNK_ ,
the idea of the normal growth of reefs
and the algae is starting to grow .
the _UNK_ reef in the North Sea
So I want to _UNK_ the _UNK_
In two times , some historians say _UNK_
and the _UNK_ feed most of the _UNK_
This is all in the _UNK_ and the &apos; 90s .
because you can see in the United States
You should read the tag where it comes from .
So I think a funny way of doing that
because people like to go out and fishing
to a place near the West of _UNK_
to drop a pile of _UNK_ and _UNK_
And it turns out that the best fish
is taken out of the boat and took a photograph
But this is the scene of the _UNK_ .
Those little fish are not even better than those .
If you want to go out and find out what &apos;s going on .
to catch fish in the sea of the sea .
And there was a sponge and a _UNK_
Now people are often talking about plastic products .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember the film ,
This is the plants in the _UNK_ flower .
It doesn &apos;t eat the people in the small store
But now , it &apos;s from hell to hell .
to allow us to use artificial _UNK_
The government subsidies is one of the reasons that we use
and all these _UNK_ fish that are _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to be underwater after death .
and look at your right , you &apos;ve got _UNK_ shrimp .
And this is a picture of a _UNK_ .
on the left side of the photograph ,
When it reaches the shore , the wind began to _UNK_
and the little _UNK_ goes into the air ,
and all the emergency rooms in the hospital are crowded .
I was talking to a friend in Hollywood
And I was wondering how to do that
&quot; Well , imagine you &apos;re in a film called _UNK_ _UNK_ beach ,
This is what I did in the French holidays last year .
And _UNK_ had to go to the _UNK_ beach
Think about the hundreds of thousands of people
and the rest of the climate change --
This is the _UNK_ . On the right , it &apos;s a beautiful picture .
The coral said , &quot; You &apos;re this liar , you &apos;re not paying the rent . &quot;
It &apos;s not all dead ; it &apos;s going to be alive .
Let me try to get you to feel sense ,
And the next morning you wake up , you look around ,
and found that the trees in the _UNK_
have been painted by the leaves , and the _UNK_ built there .
And then you see it in the newspaper a few weeks later .
Oh , by the way , a quarter of the tree died .
_UNK_ fish , pollution , and climate change --
And every thing is not happening in the vacuum ,
But because there is something called positive feedback .
for people like me to think about these problems ,
I mean , because we can now protect it .
then after 20 or 50 years of _UNK_
You &apos;re sure that you &apos;re not going to get a fish out there ,
the surface of the sea is full of water .
It &apos;s not a fish ; it &apos;s not pollution ;
The question is : Are we going to respond to this ?
I want to talk to you today about prosperity ,
I hope that this is the key to all this .
in terms of money and economic growth , it &apos;s true .
and the carbon emissions are going to be
We can &apos;t live with it , we can &apos;t live with it .
It &apos;s a difficult choice . It &apos;s not a choice .
And we &apos;re going to avoid the best way
And sometimes I think we are intelligent species .
But I think we should check those numbers ,
We will increase their income and wages every year .
How far do we need to go through ?
how much science we need in the world
And on the left side , we are now in the state .
We have to go to the right side .
We may be able to do it , maybe this is possible -- _UNK_ ?
a economy that can absorb carbon from the atmosphere ,
And this is what we need to do
So I want to spend a few minutes on the system dynamics .
It &apos;s kind of complicated , and I &apos;m sorry for it .
And what I &apos;m going to try to do is simply explain it .
the company made goods for the family -- we --
And it &apos;s better , because we can take the revenues
I just want to emphasize the most important feature in this system ,
It &apos;s going to come in a few ways --
This will _UNK_ the price and encourage us to buy more .
This is a process of production and production ,
We &apos;re going to tell each other about it --
to take the economy into social logic --
the economy and the system that we lock together
And at that time , this means the linen shirt ,
high definition television , a year of sunshine ,
and the Internet and the apple plate , and it &apos;s a lot of --
Because if we don &apos;t buy them , this system will fall down .
Of course , those _UNK_ and economic crisis are _UNK_ .
But I just want to show you some data here .
These loans and debt systems are just British .
This is the 15 years before the economic system fell .
You can see here , the consumer debt is rising sharply .
More than three years of GDP ( GDP : GDP : _UNK_ percent )
At the same time , the individual savings fell down .
This is what people do to increase debt , consumption their savings ,
We might say , &quot; Do we do the right thing ?
We actually had a lot of unusual _UNK_ .
What do people want to do in the economic crisis ?
They want to _UNK_ . They want to rely on the future .
But savings is just a wrong thing .
so that we can actually _UNK_ the economy
And here is a system of economic institutions
We don &apos;t do anything that we should do .
to install highly efficient lights , and often turn the lights out ,
But the truth is that although they have perfect economic reasons ,
I &apos;ve got my own ideas about it .
And I ended up with some of the designs
to help me get some of my five year-old children .
She turned to me to be very serious ,
These are very large , _UNK_ miles north of the distance .
Who knows how the Lake District : _UNK_ in the northwest part of England is formed .
to the kids on the bus in the morning ,
A couple of precious hours in the evening
And the night of the day after that ,
It may be more interesting to see from our perspective ,
We &apos;re looking at the map of a human heart .
In the same way , the answer became clear ,
in the last five years in the U.K.
and the rise of the United States B companies ,
I &apos;m going to show you a quick demonstration of this .
The _UNK_ also worked in the same way .
And we can type a word for search .
OK , Oxford , that &apos;s what we need . Look at what &apos;s going to happen .
If one has a job in this recession ,
And then the _UNK_ will be able to get these revenue
We need the economy to do it , in fact ,
It &apos;s going to be _UNK_ if you talk about the prosperity of people
But prosperity is far more clear than that .
a investment -- eventually , just a fundamental economy --
And let me take this hope of _UNK_ ,
in less than next room , a low _UNK_ price .
And it &apos;s obvious that we will never be able to achieve this goal .
in the real sense of prosperity in these richer countries .
Chris Anderson : At the stage , _UNK_ asked a question .
First of all , economists should not be _UNK_ ,
So you have to work on the key .
Can you think of every politician to believe this ?
We &apos;re actually happier , and the country becomes better ,
_UNK_ Jackson : It was obviously impossible for you to do it now .
You &apos;re not going to go down to the news .
You will tell us something that we are _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
In fact , I &apos;ve seen some of these things .
_UNK_ should stand out and the Ministry of Finance _UNK_ should come out ,
We accused of having to go back to the cave before .
In the last 18 years , we &apos;ve been doing this --
and some of the _UNK_ of professional economics --
Chris Anderson : But this is mostly done with _UNK_ ,
Or is it just some non - Chinese society and companies ?
_UNK_ Jackson : It must be company . It must be citizen .
It &apos;s not the same thing as citizens and commerce --
And we can do that -- what is the _UNK_ ?
that you would prefer to grow the economy .
_UNK_ Jackson : I always wanted to know you could
in the end of the century to negative value ,
is to take carbon out of the atmosphere ,
to do something that is _UNK_ and water .
If you can convince me that we can do this ,
Chris Anderson : _UNK_ , thank you for your important talk . Thank you .
I want to talk about the political structure of oil ,
and why we need to keep our attention .
Let me talk about the chemical properties of oil .
Now you can see some crude crude oil ,
oil is actually a very abstract thing for our American consumers .
We use the _UNK_ of the world &apos;s oil .
until you see this thing burning , you can understand it .
And this is what happens when it &apos;s burning .
I urge you to find a chance to look at the burning of oil ,
because you will never have to listen to it .
Let me talk to you about the chemical composition of oil .
And then the molecules in the middle contain _UNK_ carbon .
You &apos;ve heard about _UNK_ ; they &apos;re a highly _UNK_ cancer .
These huge , dense , heavy molecular containing hundreds of carbon ,
They also _UNK_ , heavy metals and _UNK_ ,
There are various strange molecules suspended on their side .
These are called _UNK_ ; they are the components of asphalt .
It is the chemical properties that lead to oil .
If it _UNK_ , the oil leak will be a completely different story .
Another thing is that when oil is contact to spread out .
some of the toxic substances floating into the _UNK_
and some small fish , the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ .
And then _UNK_ -- this is what it decided --
that are _UNK_ in the water , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
When the _UNK_ sank in the Spanish coast ,
The size of the _UNK_ is like the oil layer .
It &apos;s like the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ gum .
and every drop in contact with the oil of the water .
The supply chain of oil is _UNK_ with oil supply .
At that moment we _UNK_ oil from another angle .
So , I &apos;m going to talk about these political origins ,
Why this summer is so important that we need to focus on it .
No , they thought , &quot; Hey , I &apos;ll have to buy petrol .
It &apos;s too angry . These oil companies are _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t know how they decide how to price .
This is what we did in the gas station .
You might find a lot of gas stations , including this ,
I talked to engineers , and this was to relieve our _UNK_ ,
The price of gasoline is a conspiracy ,
and not the decline in the oil market .
We don &apos;t know about the total amount of consumption ,
First of all , there &apos;s a car that can run ,
to find and maintain this job , it has to have a gas engine
Another unusual thing is that we buy gasoline
is that we would better do something else .
It &apos;s green , it looks like a green _UNK_ .
The reason is that when we buy gasoline ,
We have a certain sort of _UNK_ disorder .
We &apos;re angry at one hand , we want to go anywhere else ,
We got into the _UNK_ of our design .
But this is actually why it works above the oil .
And as a part of the energy policy ,
We talk about energy independence . We talk about _UNK_ cars .
We &apos;re talking about organisms that have not been invented .
is part of the oil that we deal with ,
and it &apos;s also important to deal with oil leakage .
the oil industry is like a giant _UNK_ ,
but we actually think it &apos;s very _UNK_ .
This is a picture of _UNK_ . You can see , there are some _UNK_ here .
They &apos;re not farmers , but they &apos;re going to build things out of the land .
In the beginning , the moral problem is controversial ,
And then , of course , this is _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It &apos;s terrible . You think _UNK_ is a horrible model ,
Imagine what these are going to be like in _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ of the conspiracy always _UNK_ us .
She said , &quot; He has a _UNK_ like a _UNK_ .
So the man is still in with us .
I mean , this is a very popular -- this is part of our genes .
So , you might want to know why
Every time we have a good deal of oil or oil ,
_UNK_ asked them again and tried to _UNK_ them .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing since _UNK_ ,
And when we first asked them , &quot; Why do we _UNK_ profits ? &quot;
We seem to think about the whole petroleum industry
instead of looking at it from a legal and financial perspective .
I &apos;m not saying that these people don &apos;t have to answer the question ,
whether they were a group of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
that you have to change the way they work ,
So I said that this is a _UNK_ .
It &apos;s very powerful , as you saw last week .
I mean , those pictures -- this is from _UNK_ oil .
to create a modern kind of environmental movement ,
And it also _UNK_ the national policy Act ,
all of the things that come from this period .
I think it &apos;s important to look at these birds .
We stood at the gas station and felt very _UNK_ .
And then we first realized that we were in a supply chain .
As a _UNK_ , we have a moment that I found .
And that &apos;s why these oil _UNK_ in a moment .
But we &apos;re not going to be able to
The oil leak in the first two times
We &apos;re trying to solve some of the symptoms .
We &apos;re not active , but it &apos;s very _UNK_ .
_UNK_ oil in the East Coast and West Coast .
But we actually don &apos;t have to reduce the oil .
The only way to reduce our consumption is that
As you can see , our _UNK_ have reduced
Because our fuel has become old and very expensive .
We only have the _UNK_ of the world .
_UNK_ oil storage in the Gulf of _UNK_ .
And that led to another thing that happened .
in Nigeria , or the _UNK_ of Nigeria ,
which is _UNK_ -- it &apos;s about twice the size of _UNK_ --
This is the same thing as the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
We are fully aware of the oil leakage ,
What these people live in is a war zone .
And if these people live in the United States ,
They may have a political or a business degree .
They &apos;re entrepreneurs . They don &apos;t want to do what they &apos;re doing .
And this is actually another group of people
In fact , the cost of playing a _UNK_ .
And one of the places that is being done
And this is a big _UNK_ problem .
And I said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what this is . &quot;
And then there was a guy in the _UNK_ ,
They have their own private troops in the field .
We don &apos;t pay the price of the gas station .
We pay these costs in April _UNK_ _UNK_ .
That year we bombed two non - Iranian oil platform .
And then the United States started to _UNK_ there .
We don &apos;t pay the cost of the gas station .
And we can &apos;t even calculate the cost of these interference .
There &apos;s another place that keeps us dependent on oil ,
What &apos;s happening in the Gulf -- as you can see ,
but it &apos;s supposed to be a bird reserve .
And every time you buy gasoline in the United States ,
One half of them is actually _UNK_ in the coast ,
and a lot of the shipping charges are _UNK_ .
And so people in the Gulf are actually
In the end , the American family was paid for oil .
On the other hand , the price of the gas station is not very high .
When you think about the actual cost of oil ,
The truth is that people don &apos;t have any other options
That means that they pay a lot of their wages .
If you see some people making 50,000 dollars a year , they have two children ,
They actually spend a lot of time on cars and fuel
than they spend more on health care than they do .
It &apos;s hard to imagine what happens when the price is rising .
So , what I &apos;m going to tell you is ,
What law do we do ? What can we focus on ?
One is that we need to get away from those _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is possible , but we need to focus on
And one thing that we need to do ,
is that we should not _UNK_ ourselves .
that we don &apos;t have to be able to use oil ,
you can have a kind of green world .
Now what you see here is this graph
shows that oil is used in the entire U.S. economy .
It comes from here -- something useful is dark ,
is called _UNK_ energy , these waste waste waste ,
And you can see that these waste are much bigger
And one of the things that we need to do
It &apos;s not just the fuel efficiency of our vehicle .
We also need to be stable in our economy .
We need to avoid more fuel than we can .
a man who drives 20,000 miles a year
_UNK_ the same _UNK_ as a man who drove 3,000 miles .
We have a _UNK_ policy . We have all kinds of policies .
We &apos;re going to give the subsidies to oil industry ,
at least two million dollars a year ,
_UNK_ to improve the situation of people in the middle class .
with a new car and a new fuel market
We need to _UNK_ it all up ,
The main point is that we have to become stronger .
to think about who we are , really ,
where we &apos;re going to be on the gas station .
The political topic in the United States is a taboo -- like _UNK_ .
I agreed to buy a gallon of gasoline
But I think if we start this year
and then add six cents a year , nine cents a year ,
and it &apos;s going to add to 30 cents ,
so that we can reduce the consumption of gasoline
And we should give people the time to prepare ,
The people &apos;s consciousness is also rising at the same time .
Let me show you a simple idea of how this works .
This is a gasoline _UNK_ , hypothesis , from now a year .
First of all , the tax on this tax is ,
A tax on a stronger U.S. -- _UNK_ cents .
And there &apos;s a warning here that is _UNK_ ,
And what it says is , &quot; The National Science of Science
_UNK_ that every gasoline you burn in your car
So here -- you can see that you pay a lot of money
You &apos;re starting to connect with the whole system .
At the same time , there &apos;s a number you can call
or to a different kind of _UNK_ loan ,
One thing that we have to do is we remember
We have to focus on the molecules
We need to do something really _UNK_ about it .
to reduce our dependence on these fuels and molecules .
Yes , I know &quot; The English _UNK_ &quot; is the ancestor of this show .
is to tell you -- hopefully I can tell you
but by _UNK_ the language of all tribes .
We &apos;re going to look at the &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot;
And these programs have been deeply _UNK_
There is no relationship between the TV and television
and even a volunteer , like a political election ,
Of course , some people will vote for _UNK_ , but not completely .
because every year &apos;s title comes from different tribes .
In the last season , two women _UNK_ into the final match .
One of the _UNK_ is _UNK_ , from _UNK_ .
In the _UNK_ of Afghanistan , she told us
Her friends advised her not to compete with the competition .
and she said that she had _UNK_ them
I have to say that her husband had supported her from the beginning
But her tribe and family were not supported .
It seems that competition and _UNK_ are all human values .
She made a good example for young women .
There was a young woman in the audience
In _UNK_ , the audience in front of the TV
And it turns out that people in the Gulf
They also began to learn to accept their failure .
And although many players are too young to run the President ,
Last year , when I stood here , I was talking about my cross
and it was going to happen three years ago ,
It seems to me that I was yesterday .
I remember standing on the edge of the ice ,
How long did I take this frozen body
And I told me I &apos;d like to take this idea as soon as possible .
and listen to my iPod , and let me work hard ,
There &apos;s nothing better than _UNK_ &apos;s determination --
and then go to the edge of the ice ,
My finger is really like a _UNK_ sausage .
because -- you know , part of our body is made of water --
And I thought of a moment out of the water
And the lake is a couple of years ago
And the glaciers are going to go down
A third of the Earth &apos;s population in the world --
And the world &apos;s population is going to go down ,
And the glaciers are available in the water --
I was like we had a very _UNK_ threat .
In northern , we are China ; south , we have India , Pakistan , Bangladesh ,
I don &apos;t know if you have the opportunity to go to _UNK_ ,
with all the instruments to the peak --
And the challenge of swimming is not only
What I want to do is swimming on the sea level of _UNK_ meters .
It &apos;s very difficult here . You &apos;ll have a _UNK_ response .
you feel that someone is _UNK_ the hammer .
And the worst thing is that they decided
_UNK_ : To do a large _UNK_ on the _UNK_ .
And then this year , they decided to do
Some of the things that no one has done , in fact , the fish are _UNK_ .
There is no fish there at the altitude of _UNK_ meters .
And then we see the glacier in the course of the journey
And then we get to the _UNK_ :
because it &apos;s a very hard way to swim like this .
I took my iPod , and I listen to the song ,
It leads me to the _UNK_ of the water .
And then -- I don &apos;t know how to happen -- but I &apos;m underwater .
And I can jump out of the _UNK_
and then it _UNK_ to the other side .
And then I said , insist , insist on , insist , adhere to it .
I went on to make five to six _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
is the most _UNK_ way you can die .
I drag myself to the _UNK_ of my own .
And then we &apos;re going to go faster and faster
And then we did a little bit of _UNK_ :
And then my team told me directly .
We want you to spend two days on the mountain .
It takes some time to rest and think about it .
We want you to spend two days on the mountain .
She was one of the most beautiful peaks on the planet --
I was like this , and I said to myself .
I was very grateful to the _UNK_ in my team .
And one thing is that whatever it is ,
It doesn &apos;t mean what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
And then you think about the climate change ,
is not because we &apos;ve lived so long ,
can &apos;t be because we &apos;ve been spending so long
that we can &apos;t grow so long as we are ,
how to make the _UNK_ _UNK_ of _UNK_
And I asked you , please , come from here ,
how to do it with the determination of _UNK_ .
some of these changes , _UNK_ , talk about
is that it &apos;s not going to be possible .
When I do something else , I usually talk to someone else .
because it &apos;s very direct to what I &apos;m doing now .
And recently in the Silicon Valley a little bit of activity ,
And then I thought it was a little bit more
We &apos;ve seen all kinds of problems in the last few days .
the big problems , including clean water , clean energy ,
In my opinion , these are all the hardware level .
This is what I &apos;m talking about today .
I &apos;m going to tell you how we make things .
and what we &apos;re going to do in the future .
If you &apos;re a _UNK_ , TED will send you a lot of rubbish
Tell you , do that , don &apos;t do that , you have a lot of _UNK_ .
You don &apos;t even know how they can describe you
I just thought that TED would be a future biologist
I was always nervous when I heard the future _UNK_ .
because the future is _UNK_ , so you are doomed to failure .
I was laughing at a very smart colleague
I said , what if you &apos;re going to talk about the future ?
My colleague George _UNK_ was a very clever guy , he said , &quot; It &apos;s a wonderful future .
We &apos;re going to have a chance to _UNK_ their genes .
you can make your _UNK_ smell of the field .
Maybe you think it &apos;s a little bit _UNK_ .
But in these ways we &apos;ve got a pretty _UNK_ story ,
It &apos;s not my work . It &apos;s my good friend &apos;s work .
And it &apos;s called the standard of living parts .
It &apos;s developed by _UNK_ _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
What they do is to think of life as a _UNK_ system
can be combined with a unit of program
And the idea is that it &apos;s really interesting
This is a state image . It &apos;s a very simple computer .
Or from the calculation , that &apos;s equivalent to a light switch .
And one of the students in Switzerland
And the same race that happened last year
The students from Texas are _UNK_ to bacteria
that make bacteria feel light and control light or light .
And this is a very interesting thing .
The world we used to live in is a _UNK_ world .
First of all , there &apos;s a form , but I believe , I &apos;m a
I was working in a lab with _UNK_
But in order to show you the art of science --
This is a cartoon of my comic book , which I call &quot; Good _UNK_ . &quot;
That &apos;s what I did with a very good book called _UNK_ .
and so many _UNK_ to describe what I did .
But for this cartoon , he just needs a page . _UNK_ is our inspiration .
He &apos;s an interesting kid , this is his sister &apos;s sister _UNK_ .
is to look at the _UNK_ of his rice bowl
In fact , you can program and make the object _UNK_ .
You can do anything that &apos;s interesting about it .
He is fond of the complicated structure , and now it &apos;s amateur .
I &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time .
It &apos;s actually a lot of different _UNK_ material .
and it &apos;s on the side of the side .
and it &apos;s going to be about 20 _UNK_
We can also make a lot of other things
If we understand that like _UNK_ to build three dimensions ,
a program that was put in . This is a _UNK_ .
to build a very interesting thing with biological materials .
how to build a system that can _UNK_ itself .
In the natural state , they don &apos;t have to be connected
But if I did a bunch of these things ,
They can be _UNK_ , from one to _UNK_
And so we get a system of _UNK_
He did a lot of this in _UNK_
But a lot of his theory about logic
because we went to digital computer revolution , but we saw this theory again .
I &apos;m going to show you a _UNK_ _UNK_ , a automatically copying process .
And the initial state of input is that
We put it on the top of the ice hockey game .
-- a lot of scientists are _UNK_ this game .
If you look after a long time , you feel tired .
Because what you see is the chain of the chains
are all made out of the parts of it .
But why do you get a bit of _UNK_ ?
because there is a character of life
You take a linear array of cells that can easily be _UNK_ .
You can fold it into a complex three-dimensional structure
And so I thought , &quot; Well , I thought ,
Can we build a mechanical system with _UNK_ materials
And what you see is that we can _UNK_ the _UNK_ structure
The _UNK_ on the graph is based on a string of elements .
And the reason we &apos;re going to set a very simple rule
and the initial state of the very simple
is because we don &apos;t need to do that by digital logic .
And so we can make these little things smaller than a little chip .
So you can do this as a base material .
I &apos;d like to show you this video on Wednesday
This is a picture of the bricks that have been dyeing .
The sequence can accurately generate the structure of the structure
If you know a little bit about the graph ,
Now let &apos;s see here , you &apos;ll feel very comfortable .
In fact , I could draw a dog
and then _UNK_ it into a linear _UNK_
I can turn the 3D object into a string .
When you look at the world in another perspective ,
And so I thought , those are going to program the physical universe
how do we get the material and the structure
is not just adding a _UNK_ at the end .
but to make the structure and the mechanical itself become logic .
we can see a lot of problems in the same way .
You give it some conditions , like gravity ,
_UNK_ , density , and so on and on ,
So the universe makes you a perfect _UNK_
to solve other problems like five to a billion people in the world .
Can it be in any place , according to the needs of people to make the fastest possible lens ?
This machine you really have to set up some boundary conditions
_UNK_ , you can make a lens for _UNK_ ,
and then put the film on it , put pressure on it .
is that the edges and the pressure
from the negative 12 to eight _UNK_ ,
and then it goes down to the _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve seen this video , but I don &apos;t know if it really works ,
_UNK_ . This is a very _UNK_ movie .
We have a new prototype , both sides are _UNK_ .
Now , after the lens , you can pull it out .
This will be the next year &apos;s _UNK_ work , a lens ,
you see it &apos;s a very small negative _UNK_ .
When I rotate it from the side , you see it &apos;s the cylinder
And this kind of structure is considered a computing
and the structure of information can bring other things .
This is what I did in _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about it .
about the rope , you think of a complex fiber structure ,
that are going to be different from the external forces .
So this is a rope that can feel _UNK_ ,
And when you start to look at the world ,
I &apos;m going to talk to you about what I &apos;m talking about .
And one of the things I &apos;m really interested in now
If you really think of the universe as a computer ,
How do we make something that is common ?
and how do we share what we make ?
A lot of people have been talking about
the benefits of exchange information and co - operative solutions .
As a person , we are all moving in a linear time
In other words , anything you do , or you make anything .
And _UNK_ saw this in the middle of _UNK_
Their product is the best proof of it .
is that it &apos;s not just people who are such ?
And I think that &apos;s all right for a very wide idea .
How do I get everyone involved in design
And she was talking about how to get MIT students
I think we need to _UNK_ and _UNK_
about structure , materials and the way we &apos;re going to make
or how we can invent better ways to do things .
to build new things on the basis of other people .
Now I don &apos;t know how to do that .
But I believe that a lot of people are thinking about this .
Is it a compiler ? Is this a _UNK_ path ?
Maybe I &apos;m a little bit abstract from it .
But if we went back to this cartoon ,
And this is a view of the universe .
I think the future is going to be very popular .
from biology . I heard Bill _UNK_ talk , very exciting .
But we &apos;ve seen these new kinds of materials .
how we can actually transform the real information and the structure
and look at the world ? New World vision
I might have a little bit of a _UNK_
And I think there &apos;s a couple of minutes
I think -- someone said I would do something extreme .
I &apos;m going to explain it a little bit .
Maybe you can put this video to you
and _UNK_ is the lowest diameter of energy .
This is a kite designed by _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It &apos;s almost like the size of your house .
because only you can get a boat fast .
And I &apos;m also talking to some of my friends
This is another one that looks at --
This is a structure that is defined by the universe .
And you can hang it like a net ,
and you can double the speed of the ship .
It &apos;s going to be an interesting application in the future .
We need to pay more than we are now .
And we all live in the developed world ,
that we need to actually push the emissions
Now , the soft _UNK_ can &apos;t be just _UNK_ .
and the problems that are faced with
is going to feel a little bit _UNK_
when the _UNK_ problem was put in front of us
And I think this is what we &apos;re looking at .
We see the source of the gas --
They come from our _UNK_ and _UNK_ and so forth .
They come from the burning of fossil fuels
to replace the fossil fuels for clean energy .
_UNK_ , no doubt , we really need clean energy .
we would have about _UNK_ -- maybe more --
that live in the city in the city
as we now live in the northern world ,
So if we &apos;re serious about how we &apos;re on this planet ,
We need to find other ways of solving
And the solution , in fact , is probably near the front
We &apos;re going to use energy as a way of behavior --
I chose to turn this off --
we &apos;re going to use a lot of energy
But if we look at this watch carefully ,
It can show a lot of what we need to know --
the higher density of the area is low --
If you think about it , it &apos;s not hard to understand
We &apos;ll jump out and go into our _UNK_
We usually use _UNK_ to achieve our will .
what we need is that everything is around us
is that you don &apos;t need to travel at all .
is that it &apos;s going to be completely possible .
some places are doing things like this new _UNK_ .
If you know the job , you think it &apos;s going to be great .
But most of the time , what we &apos;re talking about is actually
We don &apos;t even need to increase the density of the city .
that we don &apos;t have to go to the point
to get to the goal of this goal .
You can think of it as a couple of _UNK_
It can actually improve the density of the city .
In fact , in a region that might be comfortable ,
Now we might find some places that are very large .
When we _UNK_ people together , what we see is that
They will stop driving and drive more and more people
And there &apos;s a car that &apos;s made , it &apos;s missing .
all the parking lots and lots of _UNK_
And when you can solve all of these things ,
you can actually reduce 90 percent of the time
We see more and more people in the world
people think that the idea of being transformed from a dream
And we &apos;re talking about how we &apos;re going to introduce
This is a map of _UNK_ , which shows
from my home , in 30 minutes of bus ,
Some of them walk , and it &apos;s not quite perfect .
These navigation tools are starting to appear around us .
And of course , we &apos;re learning how to put information into these _UNK_ tools
and put them in those wireless tools ,
My favorite example is a drill , who &apos;s sitting in the house ? _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ in its entire lifetime of life .
So what we did is we bought these
there are literally thousands of hours of _UNK_
And then they drill a hole in the wall , and they &apos;re sitting idle .
is actually going to translate these products into services
we need to be able to use the services
In fact , even space itself is becoming a service .
We found that people could share the same space
to help us use the mechanical equipment that we need --
to turn into a device that doesn &apos;t use energy .
and it &apos;s going to cool down the sun .
It &apos;s going to be more efficient than 90 percent
If a building itself doesn &apos;t need to be _UNK_ ,
you save a lot of money in the world .
to reduce product consumption and reduce the consumption of transportation .
All these are great , but some things need to be improved .
If we really want to be a _UNK_ city ,
This is a _UNK_ campaign , how environmental it is for their cities .
the idea that people have thought of a sustainable development
The city must be covered by the green .
So , imagine , there &apos;s this kind of thing
if they could _UNK_ into the ecosystems around us ,
so that bees and _UNK_ insects go back to our cities ?
including food , fiber , and so on .
I want to tell you that all of these are not just possible .
&quot; _UNK_ the future of steal , in the current business ,
If people live on the planet in the future of _UNK_ ,
the resources will soon be run out of us
And I think we can have the _UNK_
It &apos;s a part of our perception of the 20th century .
and we have a new understanding of ourselves .
Let &apos;s _UNK_ the environment and the times of our own .
_UNK_ , Hitler , _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ , Rwanda , _UNK_ , etc .
even though the 21st century had seven years
We &apos;ve seen the race that _UNK_ is working on .
These events led us to the following understanding of the situation .
_UNK_ is a kind of _UNK_ of modern society .
Perhaps the ancient people can get along well , and the modern people are not doing that .
A column in Boston a few years ago ,
And the author wrote about the _UNK_ Day
&quot; Though the Indians live hard , they don &apos;t face unemployment problems .
There &apos;s basically no crime , even if there &apos;s war between tribes ,
You &apos;ve got a lot of _UNK_ about this .
We learn from television and book , and so on ,
And the first question of this talk was that
&quot; You know the wrong information , &quot; I &apos;m going to give evidence
the _UNK_ of some of the _UNK_ that you &apos;ve seen
In fact , our ancestors are much more violent than us .
And over time , the violence has been going low
I think it &apos;s probably the most peaceful period of human history
It &apos;s the most _UNK_ time of peace , and it &apos;s like a _UNK_ .
But I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
And the fact is that the _UNK_ of violence
It &apos;s _UNK_ . It &apos;s going to be a thousand years ,
despite the early _UNK_ of the _UNK_ century ,
It seems that there was a _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
In the West , in particular , from the U.K.
Let me take you a look at some rights in 10 ways --
from a thousand years to a unit
to try to tell you this . Until 10,000 years ago ,
And the state is often thought to be
the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
the best evidence -- to come up with different conclusions .
to show that in some of the _UNK_ countries
The male is _UNK_ by the death of the war .
red _UNK_ that men die from other hands
to the death of the natural world .
the data comes from the New Guinea and the Amazon forests ,
some of the _UNK_ people who are _UNK_
A _UNK_ member died of the hands of others .
that are close to 60 percent of the population
and 15 percent change . The blue blue dots
of the United States and Europe in the 20th century .
and the data that is going to happen
The dead people in World War . If the death of tribes is universal .
that the number of people who die in the 20th century
We &apos;re going to look at the early civilization in the Bible .
In the Bible , the moral principle of our theory
And we can see that the behavior of war
like the _UNK_ in the _UNK_ 31 :
and killed all the _UNK_ . Moses said to them ,
What do you want to do with this woman ? So ,
You &apos;ll have all boys and all the women who have married .
But in girls , there was no family in them ,
You can live on him . &quot; In other words ,
to kill men and children , but if you see girls ,
that will leave the _UNK_ to hold them .
in the Bible , you can find four or five records .
In the Bible , the punishment of death is _UNK_ .
for example , a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_ and parents --
to look at the data of the unit
We &apos;re just based on the current history --
The violence in the human society has been reduced .
For example , any of the _UNK_ had been recorded
_UNK_ or torture is a common mode of punishment .
Now only can you be _UNK_ , in the past ,
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , dig up the eyes ,
There are lots of _UNK_ around the world .
The _UNK_ is burning , _UNK_ _UNK_ , limb limb ,
And there &apos;s a long list of _UNK_ crime :
like _UNK_ , steal bread . Of course , slavery
as a popular form . Maybe the most vivid example
It &apos;s a burning cat . The cat is _UNK_ up on the platform .
and they put them into the fire ,
The cat was suffering until it was burned .
Now , the _UNK_ _UNK_ ? This is the _UNK_ .
about the rural , village , town and town ,
And he says , &quot; From 100,000 people a year ,
100 cases of death , a little bit like a medieval _UNK_ .
and the data is going to go down
less than one percent of these people a year
in seven , eight European countries . And then _UNK_ up
Those who say rock leads to the _UNK_ of moral _UNK_ .
And there is a certain amount of truth
But the murder rate reduced at least two times .
from the Middle Ages to the point of view
The data corner appears at the beginning of the 16 th century ,
from _UNK_ , in Europe and the United States ,
the war , the serious race and military _UNK_
the number of _UNK_ is going to reduce
even in the South America . In the world ,
The death rates in the country are too fast . Here are _UNK_ .
showing the _UNK_ of war every year in 1950 .
As you can see , deaths from 1950 &apos;s _UNK_
And every war , over the last 10 years ,
Every war every year , although these wars seem cruel .
It &apos;s just a year and a unit that can see the decrease of violence .
The civil war has seldom happened since the end of the Cold War .
The genocide was almost unknown . In fact , the data decreased by 90 percent
even in the &apos; 60s and violence are small .
This is the federal crime . It &apos;s a _UNK_ .
In the &apos; 50 to &apos; 60s , the _UNK_ of violence
and it &apos;s going to go up for decades .
in the &apos; 90s , the _UNK_ of the 1990s
until we go back to the &apos; 60s ,
So the question is , why is it important
How many people have _UNK_ ? I think a lot of reasons .
One is more media reports . &quot; In the world ,
The _UNK_ is a monk in the 16th century .
There &apos;s a cognitive illusion that we know _UNK_
the more you can do it , the more you can do it .
We read the _UNK_ of the newspaper every day .
Their influence on our memory is far bigger than those in the bed .
And the idea and the market propaganda says ,
No one can just say that it &apos;s just
to attract people , to the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ ,
and to admit that the Western culture is good .
And of course , our standard changes over our behavior .
One of the reasons why violence is falling
People were tired of _UNK_ and _UNK_ at the time .
But if it &apos;s more than it &apos;s now ,
than they look at it in the history standard .
to be more _UNK_ . So now , we &apos;re trained -- it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ --
If there &apos;s a _UNK_ for 15 years of appeal ,
in Texas . We don &apos;t think about it .
In a few years , they would have been criticized by the king
And after 10 minutes of trial , you know ,
was burned -- and that was what happened .
_UNK_ . Today , we think of the punishment
And the evidence that we do is that
Now , why is violence ? No one can actually answer this question ,
But I read four different explanations , I think ,
or even more _UNK_ . The first explanation is that maybe
Thomas _UNK_ is right . He says that
The life of nature is &quot; _UNK_ , poor , dirty , _UNK_ ,
but because of the _UNK_ state . In the _UNK_ state ,
and before your neighbor _UNK_ you and _UNK_ them .
to be a story . A landlord heard the voice of the _UNK_ in the basement ,
As a good American citizen , he had a _UNK_ in his _UNK_ .
So he put a gun , and he went to the _UNK_ .
He saw a thief who was holding a _UNK_ .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to kill the man , but he might kill me .
Maybe I had the opportunity to kill him before I was in _UNK_ ,
And although , he might not want to kill me ,
He may think I &apos;ll kill before he kills me .
People who live on the hunting camp have been _UNK_ by such a clear thought ,
It is usually because of worrying about being killed and killing their neighbours .
Now , one way to solve this problem is by _UNK_ :
You don &apos;t have to attack first , but the _UNK_ declared
If you are _UNK_ , you will have rough _UNK_ .
It &apos;s called _UNK_ , so it can only be _UNK_ .
to be possible . In order to make it possible , you have to _UNK_ all the _UNK_
_UNK_ all the _UNK_ , but it will lead to _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Life becomes a _UNK_ family . The _UNK_ solution
&quot; _UNK_ &quot; is that if it &apos;s legal rights to violence ,
is a single democratic institution -- a _UNK_ --
and then a country that can reduce the attack ,
the best thing to strike is zero . That will be _UNK_ because other people are afraid to attack you first .
The emergency attack on the other side of the road .
and it can be _UNK_ to make your own _UNK_ .
in the _UNK_ . So it leads to
a country peace . _UNK_ -- you don &apos;t see it in front of the slide .
the person who _UNK_ the killing rate --
and argued that the period of _UNK_ in Europe
That &apos;s a little bit of a _UNK_ theory .
and support it and what we see today
_UNK_ behavior : In the _UNK_ countries , the _UNK_ Empire ,
The second explanation is that in many places ,
There is a general view of life being low .
In early days , when _UNK_ and early death were _UNK_
In normal times , people are responsible for _UNK_ or death .
is not strong . When technology and economics are effective ,
Life extension and _UNK_ , people have a higher evaluation on life value .
The political scientist James _UNK_ had a little bit about it .
And the third idea of using _UNK_ and game ,
In the reporter &apos;s book &quot; The _UNK_ &quot; --
to talk about it . White points out in special _UNK_ .
are good , like the _UNK_ of trade , when both sides exchange ,
and their surplus , or when the two sides
put down the arms , which is called a peace line .
so that it &apos;s not going to happen again .
_UNK_ , people tend to be allowed to make goods , trade and thought .
and it &apos;s going to be a longer journey
in a lot of people that are exchanged .
And it turns out that other people are more useful than death ,
Because of the private sector , violent decline . Like _UNK_ said ,
&quot; Well , one of the reasons that we should not bomb Japan
The fourth explanation of the book is that
&quot; _UNK_ , &quot; by the philosopher , Peter _UNK_ ,
He argued that evolution had been _UNK_ to mankind
_UNK_ : a kind of _UNK_ the interests of others
We are restricted to the narrow circle of friends and family .
to use it . But through the history of history ,
the circle has expanded . You can see , history records ,
It spread from the country to _UNK_ and expanded to tribes ,
to expand the country , to expand to other races , to _UNK_ .
And in _UNK_ &apos;s paper , some of the things we should have expanded
If it &apos;s true , what is the expansion of this expansion ?
It &apos;s possible . In this sense , it &apos;s going to increase
that Robert White had thought of as a _UNK_ .
The Golden Rule is : the more you think of others , the more you communicate ,
The more you realize that you will _UNK_ your interests above others .
At least you want them to listen to you . You can &apos;t say
And you say that you &apos;re standing in that place
is a unique place in the universe --
because it happened that you were standing there at that moment .
It may also be _UNK_ by the world :
News , _UNK_ and reality fiction and travel ,
and literature , that allows you to engage yourself
that you think is the life of the second class ,
at the same time , you know , in your own life ,
The _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ; the feeling of _UNK_ .
or whatever reason , the rise of violence
has a profound impact . It should force us to ask , &quot; Why is it going to be
the war ? &quot; And why would it be peace ? &quot;
&quot; What are we wrong ? &quot; What are we doing ? &quot;
to find out what we &apos;re doing is going to be right .
Chris Anderson : I love this talk . I think many people in this room
That expansion -- the one that you talked about ,
And Peter _UNK_ says that at the same time because technology ,
because other people are _UNK_ , because it &apos;s all _UNK_ to the world .
and expansion . I mean , what do I mean ?
_UNK_ : Well , it &apos;s a very good idea . It &apos;s both _UNK_ ,
to allow us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation
in a larger circle . And I think it helps us
Imagine what other people are . I think when you read
some of those terrible experiences in the Middle Ages , you think ,
How can they _UNK_ their _UNK_ people ?
And for them , they &apos;re like aliens ,
don &apos;t have a feeling for their _UNK_ . I think ,
It &apos;s easier to make things mean that it &apos;s able to increase
CA : Well , Steve , I hope everyone in the press will hear this next year
_UNK_ . I think it &apos;s too important . Thank you very much .
If it &apos;s not , one of them needs to upgrade , right ?
When I was talking to my students about global issues ,
I was listening to them when I was drinking coffee .
And then when they go back to the classroom ,
I asked them , &quot; Do you say &quot; We &quot; and &quot; What do they mean ? &quot;
&quot; Ah , that &apos;s easy , the Western world and the developing world , &quot; they said .
But you know , I put pressure on them .
So , a girl said , &quot; It &apos;s easy .
Western countries have a long life in a small family .
The developing world is a relatively short life in a large family . &quot;
I love that because it allows me to go
And you can see that this _UNK_ represents
family size . Every woman has one , two , three , five , five .
And this is the world in my students .
Men and women decide whether they create a small family ,
whether to take care of their children , and their lives ,
is related to the kitchen . If you have soap , water and food , you know ,
And the students are right . This is not the world --
And the world includes here , a group of countries here ,
They have big families and shorter lives . In developing countries .
And then we have a group of countries here
What happened was that in this world I lived in .
and all the developing countries have used family plans .
And you can see all family around the world are moving away
But some countries are still in the original place .
And then you can see Afghanistan or under that .
When we , in fact , we &apos;ve shown it all over the world .
Last week , I was at the World Health Conference in Washington ,
and compared to the progress of the United States .
in the same position as the United States .
In global health experts , only five percent of the _UNK_ are expected .
The problem is that a lot of weapons come from north ,
across the border . So they have to stop this .
Because , you know , they have some strange relations with the United States .
because this is a free device on the Web .
And I can show the rest of the country .
Now I have a income on this _UNK_ .
There is only 2,000 dollars in the United States .
And the life expectancy is 35 to 40 years ,
I &apos;m going to show you right now what &apos;s going on in the world .
You can see me one minute , and you &apos;ll see everything .
You can see these brown bubbles , which are Western ,
And the yellow one is the United States ,
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re scared of flu , right ?
You can notice that we have Mexican here .
Mexico and the United States are not exactly the same .
because my big son is working in Google ,
because it took a child . My son and my wife in the closet
And my little son , studying Chinese in Beijing .
So I have two different opinions , you know ?
My son , one of the smallest _UNK_ in Beijing .
And the big son of Google work ,
Or Google is a very _UNK_ , so he can have a year or two years .
We call it the Great _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And then it died . And then the _UNK_ started
Is it strange ? Look at the United States
and start to increase the economy and then grow rich .
is that it &apos;s not surprising to the development of these countries .
Because what you see here is this
And I &apos;m going to suggest to my students
It &apos;s like two parts of the United States .
And the last part is about the President , Obama &apos;s president .
This is what we call the developing world ,
And that &apos;s the whole world that &apos;s going to happen .
And that &apos;s the right way to develop cities .
So how can we get a better understanding of this ?
Well , one of them is to see if we can
This is the distribution of the world &apos;s population ,
from one dollar . This is where you get food .
It &apos;s 10 dollars , no matter whether you have a public or a public ,
Provide a healthy service for your family to provide schools for your children .
This is the East Asia . This is the _UNK_ .
What do you see ? Look at the number of _UNK_ income
Is this going into the poor Asian country ?
But I had to stop here in _UNK_ , because --
because these predictions are not going to be .
but it &apos;s going to be like that in a minute .
And we have a world that can &apos;t be seen apart .
And that gives us the foundation for help .
Well , the cost of our rescue is actually coming from these places .
In the last ten years they &apos;ve been spending their savings .
And here is the country of the war ,
That &apos;s why to describe what &apos;s happening in the developing world .
We look at it in a different way .
I hear that your department is _UNK_ in the area .
In Africa , South Africa , in the bottom .
But when I separate them apart , when I split them up ,
And here &apos;s the size of the bubble .
You can see Sierra _UNK_ and _UNK_ are exactly the same .
And when I separate other things , East Asia ,
We &apos;re here . We have a continuous world .
This is _UNK_ . This is the time in Washington ,
And here I think I need to make a speech .
This is my mission , which is the rest of the world ,
Many people don &apos;t realize -- it &apos;s not a joke .
It makes us a sure thing about the world .
to enjoy the world . Thank you very much .
and then added a little bit of profit to sell them ,
But those who work in the World Bank
is that we want to upgrade our international plan
to deal with international issues in modern ways , when we deal with it .
When this meets free and transparent data ,
The United States is one of the best .
And it &apos;s not just the _UNK_ of the Swedish health professor .
I want to show you what &apos;s going on on in the data ,
This is what the national security is to know .
with the _UNK_ countries in the _UNK_ world .
And we went on . But here we are , of course ,
The Congo is over here . We have the past
_UNK_ billion people , like what we &apos;ve heard today ,
But those important _UNK_ are going to measure it .
because that &apos;s the only child mortality that we can measure .
We often say that every year will drop 4 percent a year .
They start well , and they fully use foreign aid .
and they beat Sweden every year in _UNK_ percent .
And then again , the United States has a part here .
They have more safety water , they offer food to poor people .
_UNK_ percent . They are faster than the _UNK_ development goal .
Well , I have Singapore , and I was born for the year .
and started . They spent a little bit of time .
They begin to invest in society . They get rid of malaria .
We never thought that they would win Sweden !
These green countries are already in the process of _UNK_ .
The yellow ones are also ready to start .
The red countries have nothing to do , and their policy needs to be improved .
We also have to give our _UNK_ a objective foundation .
This is income per capita . This is the number of AIDS in the country .
The size of the bubble represents how many people are infected .
about 20 percent of the adult population is infected .
And even though they have a very high income ,
But you can see some African countries underneath it .
There is no massive HIV epidemic in Africa .
Here &apos;s a number of numbers , five of Africa -- 10 countries .
with Sweden and Sweden and the United States .
And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
One of the best countries in Africa has the most active economy
They have a very high infection level . They &apos;re falling .
is being treated . So people who are infected don &apos;t die .
But there &apos;s no economy . There &apos;s more rich countries .
Look at some provinces in Kenya . They &apos;re very different .
not to say Africa . It &apos;s not about race problems .
This is the place . It &apos;s in every place .
100 million people are being _UNK_ by poverty .
This is the disease called _UNK_ , and I spent _UNK_
This is because of the famine , rapid treatment of toxic _UNK_ .
This is similar to the _UNK_ of the Mississippi .
This is in _UNK_ . This is in the south part of Tanzania .
is not going to work on the emerging economy .
We need a new attitude . The world is _UNK_ .
But it &apos;s not that at the bottom of the _UNK_ .
They are still as poor as they were before .
It &apos;s not sustainable . It &apos;s not going to be around a _UNK_ .
and the most hopeful _UNK_ in the time ,
And we are giving you the _UNK_ . Thank you very much .
This year I spent a while in the _UNK_ Republic
but it &apos;s only 300 miles . It &apos;s going to go .
In the last 10 years , there were _UNK_ people in the East
and spent a lot of time talking about _UNK_ ,
but it &apos;s the place where _UNK_ and its clients visit .
because only three percent of the people use
with a _UNK_ and selling a _UNK_ .
They say that even though they offer free or _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s going to be done at the same time .
So I started to look at marketing ,
and the aid agency , when they were _UNK_ ,
They give _UNK_ names like _UNK_ and so on .
to remind you of who &apos;s _UNK_ in this box .
It &apos;s not a guy who &apos;s going to buy _UNK_
In these regions , the private companies in the private sector
and maybe it &apos;s not going to be _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not the people who work at the moment
What you want to think about is who &apos;s your _UNK_ .
And the reason is that what &apos;s going to happen
to convince you that history is direction -- like a arrow .
I was going to come to my TED talk ,
-- there was no _UNK_ around the world
The bird flu has not been _UNK_ in Europe .
The _UNK_ did not win the Palestinian election .
to tell you that if you were invited ,
I can see that there &apos;s a lot of
I might say , &quot; Can I say something else ? &quot;
But I didn &apos;t say that , well , I could only try to look at it .
The positive meaning of my _UNK_ is difficult to understand
And when I said , &quot; I can become optimistic ,
And I thought , I tried to _UNK_ this thing .
There was a little _UNK_ , so --
-- if it &apos;s a _UNK_ spirit , I &apos;m afraid ,
This is the most optimistic thing you can get from me today .
The history development has a certain _UNK_ of the idea that it will not cause too many disputes .
and the social structure becomes more complex and more advanced .
the origin of life , from a cell ,
And then they &apos;re close to each other , and they make a lot of cells .
Then there are more complex cells ; it can understand a form of community .
a little bit of time , a number of cells
There &apos;s some amazing things that are going to happen
_UNK_ a whole new evolutionary process : culture evolution .
the evolution of culture is the evolution of thought .
Many of you have heard of the word &quot; culture &quot; .
And I &apos;ve been looking at the evolution of technology ,
And we started with a little _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , until someone said , why don &apos;t we stick the _UNK_ ?
But technology evolved to be a sustainable process , so they &apos;ve been 20,000 years ,
and technology is also a _UNK_ evolution ,
So we &apos;ve got this one for 250 years .
I &apos;m sorry -- this is a cold joke , I &apos;m just a joke .
to find a way to explain _UNK_ ,
The collapse of the system in the world today ,
First of all , we &apos;re going to look at the social system in the world
is how evolution is going to look like today .
At first , a complex , _UNK_ village with hunting and collecting .
In the chief society , there was agriculture , this is a kind of
With the invention of writing , the city appears . It looks _UNK_ . But I love it ,
The whole process is like the evolution of the _UNK_ organization ,
that the organism has evolved through the layer ,
It &apos;s what it looks like today . Here you must be _UNK_ , the Empire .
I must stress that social organizations are not restricted by political boundaries .
The _UNK_ _UNK_ the ancient Chinese and Roman Empire .
We see the social properties of the _UNK_ continent ,
even though the government is different . There are so many countries today ,
But obviously , all sorts of organizations have developed
This is a picture of the Earth in the night ,
I think it &apos;s pretty beautiful to me ,
is that it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ .
Now , I &apos;m going to use the _UNK_ and the effect
to think that some people may not read the data ,
In the game , the relationship between _UNK_ is opposition :
This relationship can be profitable , not a _UNK_ game .
The score is always zero , but in the _UNK_ ,
your partner , with you on the same front ,
You are always _UNK_ , and you are always _UNK_ .
In economics , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
But as the technology progress , the new technology _UNK_ ,
to promote the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
to ensure that we have such a potential that you know ,
and the _UNK_ that you don &apos;t know ,
For example , when you buy a car ,
You have no idea how many people in the world are ,
about the process of making this car ? These people ,
And obviously , they have a lot of people .
In some sense , this is actually a very positive _UNK_ ,
Because what you think about is a double win ,
First of all , it doesn &apos;t have any _UNK_ .
because of the _UNK_ of the moth ,
It can only guarantee that it &apos;s either _UNK_ or is bad ,
So , what I &apos;m going to do is ,
Is it the following answer to the whole history process ?
First of all , I think , in general ,
People are always able to get more profitable results .
I think the history process , in _UNK_ , the net result is now .
And there was an amazing demonstration to me ,
The history process , which has a moral dimension ,
There is a moral point . It can see that moral is growing with time .
to deal with them . With the beginning of moral revolution ,
They changed the idea that all the Greeks were human .
But at least it &apos;s a progressive -- _UNK_ , giving the Greeks a little _UNK_ today .
It &apos;s even bigger . I think -- I hope -- most of you ,
Unless they do something that _UNK_ , whatever racial religion .
You should go to the ancient history and see how this is a revolution .
I think formal because of _UNK_ and effect , thousands of years ago ,
is to learn to _UNK_ the nationality of _UNK_ ,
There is no difference between race and religion . If you ask me ,
Why don &apos;t I support the Japanese bomb bomb ,
If I say that it &apos;s because of my _UNK_ , it &apos;s a joke .
And I think that this relationship really _UNK_ us ,
because other people are actually related to your welfare .
I think this is a moral principle of _UNK_ .
And unfortunately , I don &apos;t often sit in the _UNK_ company ,
It &apos;s not too much to know the _UNK_ of other airline companies .
I &apos;ll say , in the _UNK_ , you don &apos;t hear _UNK_ .
because the people who are sitting in the room
to deal with all kinds of people ;
They just wanted to make money from these people . So I thought , at least ,
And it helped people to expand the world
It &apos;s not just the economy -- it &apos;s not only a _UNK_ economy --
_UNK_ and mechanism led us to the edge of the moral truth ,
And that &apos;s the equivalent of every person .
And when we go into a social institution ,
But how do you explain the conflict between different civilizations ? First of all ,
I want to stress that these conflicts are _UNK_ and mechanism ,
that the Muslim world is related to the Western world --
These are the words I don &apos;t like , but I can &apos;t avoid them --
In such a short time , no more effective than those words .
If the Muslim world _UNK_ more hostile and more hate ,
It &apos;s _UNK_ for the Western world . In other words , if they are happier , it &apos;s good for the West .
This mechanism , because of the trends of technology ,
This _UNK_ and mechanism will be more intense in negative direction .
Their future fate will be more likely to have negative relations .
I call _UNK_ the destructive effect of _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is likely to _UNK_ violence in the United States ,
_UNK_ them to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ tribe .
I think this is going to continue to _UNK_ ,
is because of the rapid development of information technology ,
And what I &apos;m particularly worried about is that
This dynamic change leads to a cycle of feedback , forcing us to _UNK_ .
My idea is that terrorism has happened ; our response is too intense .
We are not so rational for the _UNK_ of terrorism ,
When we feel _UNK_ , our response will be more intense , this is the human nature ,
you can call the positive feedback effect of negative emotions ,
We don &apos;t even use this word &quot; _UNK_ , even though it &apos;s just a term .
So let &apos;s call the _UNK_ of negative emotions .
I dare say that once this effect begins , in the end ,
So what do we do ? First of all , we &apos;re not just armed control ,
although I don &apos;t think much about it , it &apos;s also necessary .
And I think it &apos;s going to be
I think , different groups -- different races , religion , any different group ,
They &apos;re going to reduce , and the _UNK_ behavior is going to reduce ,
Well , I must admit that when I &apos;m such a _UNK_ , I think I &apos;m silly .
It sounds like I was _UNK_ , like _UNK_ said ,
But I &apos;m at the moment , and I don &apos;t have any choice .
And the _UNK_ of the world must be reduced ,
And although it sounds _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to keep myself up ,
-- thank you . And that means , remember ,
I &apos;m talking about all the moral , and all my _UNK_ .
And when your benefits can bring me welfare , so _UNK_ ,
I am absolutely _UNK_ to the welfare of you .
And this is the source of moral progress .
I added that our fate was tightly connected .
And if people take the wise response ,
We &apos;re talking about the evolution of this kind of business ethics .
So these two aspects -- people noticed that this is _UNK_ ,
and they move from their own interests --
This is why I _UNK_ the destructive effects of _UNK_ . &quot;
and the death of negative effect &quot; on a big title :
Well , the moral evolution is really hard , right ?
And the answer that I &apos;m talking about is ,
And we all have a lot of people .
We &apos;re starting at the moment . As an American ,
Our children have 10 years , 20 years , 30 years of safety ,
I &apos;m worried -- my personal set of things --
is to know why the world is , how many people hate us .
Basically , this could be a little moral rescue practice .
In this strange culture context , really can understand them ,
is a great achievement in the moral _UNK_ ,
You have to connect them with your experience ,
to really understand , to say , &quot; Ah , I know .
And so when they feel so angry ,
for the same reason . &quot; It &apos;s really true .
I think you should add this understanding to your moral category .
When the other people hate you , it &apos;s particularly difficult , right ?
I mean , you certainly want to know why , but you don &apos;t want to link them back and forth .
You don &apos;t want to say , &quot; Okay , I know ,
would hate my country . &quot; It was a _UNK_ thing ,
but I think we have to be able to adapt .
And I want to emphasize that the reason
Some people don &apos;t like my whole _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
And the fundamental reason is that they don &apos;t want to know
Why people hate us . But I want to know .
only to figure out why they hate us ,
We can let them not hate us , right ?
When we _UNK_ this moral _UNK_ , really _UNK_
and their humanity , to understand them more ,
that they can make sense of our ideas .
This is the first step . This is a target that needs long - term effort to achieve .
Some people have _UNK_ , and you know ,
The cause is what I write in the column .
I wrote a word that was charged with ,
The good news is that at least one of the _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
If you must have a _UNK_ , then look for Anne _UNK_ .
They &apos;re not going to be afraid of it .
that makes it more difficult to convey these _UNK_ feelings .
But I also think that choice doesn &apos;t understand , it &apos;s going to be a bigger mistake ,
And the situation is already clear that ,
We can &apos;t let the soldiers go to kill terrorists .
I don &apos;t care about the problem . So --
-- I mean , we have to take more direct measures ,
And once we &apos;re successful -- that &apos;s what happens ,
Our moral standard will be in the new level .
If you look at the _UNK_ of the Bible --
to save the soul , to bring people to heaven -- that &apos;s what happened .
The _UNK_ in the Bible means that saving social system .
&quot; The LORD is our _UNK_ , &quot; he saved the Israeli country , &quot;
At that time Israel was a very senior social organization .
Now , the entire Earth is a social organization , so I suspect ,
If I say I can give you the good news ,
And as long as the standard and _UNK_ , the wise pursuit of self ,
It &apos;s hard . But we &apos;re going to try and figure out
because we are unable to look back now .
I &apos;m very happy to be able to do so much ...
And I &apos;m really happy and privilege to be
Every thing I &apos;d like to say is that they &apos;ve done it .
It looks like I can &apos;t say anything about it .
And if a flower comes out of the trunk ,
So , since I &apos;m not so young ,
And we &apos;re opening this in a very _UNK_ time .
The _UNK_ _UNK_ , the solution to Africa ,
And unfortunately , I don &apos;t believe that _UNK_ plans
First of all , the achievement of _UNK_ was _UNK_ .
But the aid took only one percent of their GDP
to achieve so much of their GDP .
This is a big migration in the past .
But what I &apos;d like to say is that we need to talk about
the Western media is about how Africa and the aid
The media are showing the real situation in Africa , really is true .
But the media didn &apos;t tell us all the real things
although the real part of our African world
And that means that the media reports only six countries
But the Western media has a lot of access to their audience
But the action of those reports is just compassion .
for mercy , the aid that you call
What do we do ? We should give people hungry food
We should be sent to medicine for sick people .
to save the people who are in the civil war
In this process , Africa has lost its own independence .
And I want to say that important is _UNK_
But at the same time , there &apos;s a lot of potential
We need to _UNK_ the test of Africa .
We _UNK_ it for a very hopeful test . It &apos;s worth
all the people who care about Africa are facing this test .
If you say , &quot; Africa _UNK_ , they need poverty . &quot;
for the poor people to take care of food ,
to the civil war to the _UNK_ troops .
And all of these things don &apos;t have to be solved
because of the basic problems in Africa
You know , these are not going to create wealth
The stable income is the fundamental , and the stable income comes from .
Now , we &apos;re starting to talk about how Africa &apos;s wealthy
is entrepreneurs , and reality tells us that they &apos;ve been
only four percent of the world &apos;s population , but _UNK_ is not really a real entrepreneur .
but they can be equal to the work of entrepreneurs .
We need to use money in places that can create wealth ,
to support private investment in Africa , whether domestic or abroad ,
because knowledge is part of the creation of wealth .
But what are the international aid organizations doing now in Africa ?
They spent the money on the basis of healthcare
Ladies and gentlemen , who can tell me
your neighbor , your friends and your family ,
And you &apos;ve heard of some of these examples
You &apos;ve heard that one country is through
Andrew _UNK_ : I heard _UNK_ that he knew this country
Thank you very much , but let me tell you .
_UNK_ can only give you a chance
can grab this opportunity and turn it into a advantage
and the framework of policy to help us
from our foreign relations . I can give you an example
Europe had given a great opportunity to Africa
Non - _UNK_ duties to export goods to the European Union market .
My country , Uganda , I get an opportunity to export 50,000 tons .
we import 50,000 tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba .
There is a certain _UNK_ tariff on exports to the European Union .
No country , including the most successful country in Africa ,
So what I &apos;d like to say is that Africa &apos;s _UNK_
is because it doesn &apos;t have a good system and policy framework .
to create the institution of wealth and wealth
What should we do ? Why is aid not a good thing ?
You know why aid is not a good thing ?
because all government needs to go to maintain
to maintain legal justice and social order need money .
to set up military and police to maintain legal and order .
And because most of the governments are more _UNK_
What they really need is to do with the military
And then all political activities need to spend money
except for a few _UNK_ that are _UNK_ ,
you can choose to rule the force completely .
In this case , the basic need of education
depends on whether it can get more money from people .
and what kind of policy and systems they &apos;re talking about .
is that they continue to expand the business
so it can get more taxes from them .
and it _UNK_ itself to the system .
The main source of the government &apos;s financial revenues
with the World _UNK_ Fund and the World Bank .
I want to say , even if you have 10 Ph.D. degrees ,
You can &apos;t even know more about the computer industry ,
Why ? Because you need to know the knowledge
you have to listen to people and institutions in this industry
The government in Africa has been a chance
So let &apos;s start talking to the International _UNK_ Fund .
and the World Bank , and the international currency fund and the World Bank
In this whole process , Africa is completely ignored .
We have to limit it because the boss has spent the money
The International _UNK_ Fund , the World Bank and the world
because the government relies on aid , so what they &apos;re doing
to follow the people &apos;s creditors rather than their own country .
But I want to add a little bit
the aid is not the destruction of the destruction .
some aid to build a hospital , the hungry villagers
and built the road , and the road was built
and they &apos;re going to go in thousands of dollars .
and ignore every village that was aid was different .
is that the key to the aid plan
like the _UNK_ of the Kenya in _UNK_
to be the most profitable thing in the government
especially for a person who is looking for work ,
Every race looks at the first countries that are _UNK_ .
in order to get foreign aid to get foreign aid .
Ladies and gentlemen , the most _UNK_ people in Africa
and can &apos;t find the opportunity to trade and work in private trade .
because the system and policy environment are opposed to business .
because they don &apos;t need to talk to their country
So there was an _UNK_ African who had to work for the government
And this has added to the political tension of our country .
I want to say that in the last 50 years
Africa received more and more aid from the international
including technical aid , the economic aid of the economy
In 1960 , Africa received 20 million dollars of aid
We are still told that Africa is still poor .
I want to use _UNK_ countries -- Uganda , for example ,
to see how the aid is to spend
In 2006 &apos;s budget , it &apos;s going to be 20 million _UNK_ .
the daily cost of Uganda , the daily spending
why the government budget of Uganda is _UNK_
because there &apos;s an international aid to help
But here you see the government of Uganda
The public administration , it &apos;s _UNK_ , it &apos;s got to do it .
_UNK_ is a very poor country in agriculture .
So I &apos;m going to tell you about the public spending ,
We looked at 70 cabinet members , a President _UNK_ ,
By the way , nobody had seen the President except on television .
When you really saw him , _UNK_ was in the public
And even so , that &apos;s what they proposed .
every single local government structure is the same as the central government .
There are 56 _UNK_ , when our President wants to go
And he added 25 _UNK_ , and now there &apos;s a _UNK_
And all of these institutions need the director and the car ,
Let &apos;s turn to Mr. _UNK_ , his latest job may help us .
There was _UNK_ in Uganda , there was a sick _UNK_
and the international aid _UNK_ for aid projects
And finally , I &apos;d like to talk to you about
That is , a good talk should be like a _UNK_ .
when I was a _UNK_ in the United States ,
It &apos;s just the same thing I &apos;m going to talk about today .
_UNK_ &apos;s editorial told us that 10 reasons ago
And CNN found me , and she said to me ,
Can you talk about the status of psychology ?
We want to interview you in this respect . And I said ,
She said , but this is CNN , so you can only _UNK_ a little bit
And I said , &quot; Well , how can I tell a few words ?
We should give you a little bit of a _UNK_
Now , I can tell a few words ? _UNK_ , you &apos;re talking about two words .
Dr. _UNK_ , how is the status of psychology ?
We know that you &apos;re not going to adapt
Professor _UNK_ , how is the status of psychology ?
No , that &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
I want to talk about why psychology are good , and not good .
and how psychology can become good in the next 10 years .
And I want to talk about technology at the same time .
_UNK_ and design , because of the status and psychology
because in the last 60 years , psychology set up a disease model
10 years ago , when I was sitting in the airplane ,
I introduce myself to my neighborhood to tell them my career
The goal of psychology is to find out where you have problems , who are _UNK_ .
And now if I tell people about my profession , they want to come up
is that all the _UNK_ in the last 60 years
And the other thing is that science develops .
We found that we could _UNK_ these _UNK_ concepts
We can _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the mental diseases .
We can understand the consequences of mental diseases .
We can look at some people in a long period of time
for example , in the gene that is incredibly susceptible to schizophrenia
We want to know the role of _UNK_ and congenital genes .
The best thing is that in the last 50 years
And we can do it through _UNK_ trials ,
to take the useless remove , and leave it useful .
CONCLUSION : In the past , psychology and _UNK_ studies
is really going to reduce pain for pain .
I think this is great , and I &apos;m proud of it .
but it &apos;s not good , like the following three consequences .
And we thought that people were not able to do anything
We forget that people are going to choose and do it .
The second loss is that we forget those people
We forget to make the normal people happier , _UNK_ , more achievements .
the genius , the higher level of intelligence becomes _UNK_ .
And the third question of the disease model
is that we are anxious to help people get ill .
We went in a hurry to repair the damage .
Because so , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , Mike _UNK_ , I have my own .
to study what I call &quot; positive psychology , &quot;
The first is that psychology is not only about the weakness of human beings .
not only do it to repair the injury , but also to work for people .
should be interested in the best things in life .
should be at the same time in the patient
We want positive psychology to be able to look like this in the past 10 years .
as a science of science , which is going to happen .
that we can measure the happiness of different forms .
to do all kinds of happiness tests there .
You can see yourself in a positive mood , happiness and _UNK_ .
and compared with tens of thousands of other people .
We create and mental _UNK_ diagnosis and _UNK_ standards .
We have the advantages and advantages of gender ,
and their structures and the obstacles that are facing
We found that we could find positive sources
and the relationship between the brain activity --
I &apos;ve been working on the help of a particular suffering
What is the difference between the _UNK_ and other people ?
About six years ago , we turned in and asked
What is the difference between the people and others ?
They &apos;re not much more religious than others ; they &apos;re not better than others .
They &apos;re not rich than others ; they &apos;re not better than others .
They don &apos;t have a lot of success in their lives .
The only difference is that they are very good and _UNK_
But look carefully , these data are just connected , not _UNK_ .
and their happiness is the _UNK_ of happiness .
I &apos;m going to tell you that this is not enough .
from Buddha to Tony _UNK_ , who is the potential of _UNK_
We &apos;ve been able to operate a lot of these
What is it that really makes people lasting happiness ?
And then I &apos;ll tell you the results of the research
is that people who have a psychological disease
that the people who are suffering from pain
And the psychology is supposed to be
I don &apos;t often use this word , but I &apos;m going to ask this question .
We have to split the concept of happiness
And the reason is that they are different
is because they come from different interventions
in your life , you &apos;re not going to be more positive .
You work hard , take children , love , _UNK_ time for you to stop .
I want to talk a little bit about three life
The first one that life is a pleasant life .
you have a lot of joy that you don &apos;t have anymore .
and you learn how happy you are .
And this is the place of positive psychology .
And the first one is that the _UNK_
This is not easy to change the mood .
So the _UNK_ and I have other people
there are more positive ways to use it .
15 percent to 20 percent of the potential _UNK_
The second disadvantage is that people can adapt to positive emotion .
like French _UNK_ , the first one is 100 percent delicious .
But in the sixth sense , there is no taste .
I have to talk to you about my friend _UNK_ .
to give you a sense of positive psychology
and not 30 years old , _UNK_ has achieved a tremendous success in three ways .
And the first one is to work in the world
He &apos;s not a option for 20 years old .
and he was 25 years old and he became a _UNK_ .
The second is a _UNK_ : he &apos;s the national _UNK_ .
But in the third aspect , love , love , _UNK_ failure .
And the reason is that he &apos;s very cold , like a _UNK_ fish .
And when he was dating with American women , they said ,
You don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t have a positive mood , boiling up !
_UNK_ enough money to ask the best psychological analysis
This psychological analysis took five years to find
and the _UNK_ is _UNK_ by the heart .
But what &apos;s going to happen is not to find
In fact , New York City grew up
He played football , watching football matches , _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The _UNK_ belongs to the highest 5 percent of emotional population .
And the question is , _UNK_ ? I don &apos;t think he &apos;s _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ are very _UNK_ about the human emotions .
I think one of the _UNK_ people I know
This is because of most of you , very good at heart flow .
When he walked into the American _UNK_ in the morning ,
It seems to be stopped until the _UNK_ closed .
It seems to be stopped until 10 days later ,
And this is what Harry said by _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not the same thing as the ordinary happiness .
When you &apos;re happy , you can feel your happiness .
But Mike told you what was in _UNK_ yesterday , and you &apos;re not feeling it .
We think this is a characteristic of life .
and try to _UNK_ your life with these advantages .
For example , I &apos;ve been studying a _UNK_ in a store
And so she was trying to work hard
But then she used to work as much as possible
and _UNK_ the biggest advantage that she had .
What you get is not a smile out of it .
You smile , and you get a lot more spiritual .
This is the second road , the first road is positive .
And this is the most _UNK_ part of happiness .
And as the second road , what it means here
is that you know where your biggest advantage is , and use them .
you &apos;re going to find a little more _UNK_
I just mentioned three life , happy life ,
in life , in a sense of life , people want to know
The answer is certain , I &apos;m going to give you some examples
as much as the drug that we test ,
and try to find ways of intervention .
One of your tasks is to use your careful and _UNK_
_UNK_ the next Saturday , give yourself a wonderful day
with talent and carefully _UNK_ these happy things .
We can prove that this is a really _UNK_ .
Another _UNK_ is grateful that if you want to ,
I want you to remember a very important thing
And I want you to find this guy
to write a letter of 300 words for that person .
and say you &apos;re going to visit them , don &apos;t say why , come home .
and you read them to them -- everybody would fall tears in this case .
A week later , a month later , three months later ,
And we tested , and we found these people getting happier and depressed .
Another example is that the _UNK_ is a _UNK_
We got a pair of partner and let them know their best advantage
And then we designed a night with each other ,
And we found that this could improve their relationship
And the way is that it &apos;s not good for you .
because many of you have been _UNK_ with charity .
However , my graduate and my tests are not aware of the _UNK_ .
you find that when you do something interesting ,
When you can help someone else , happiness is not long .
The second thing I want to talk about is that
and we &apos;re interested in how happy people are
This is what we &apos;re going to look for .
We think of this problem as the interaction of three different lives .
We &apos;ve studied thousands of individuals in 15 copies .
What is the pursuit of life that affects our lives ?
And it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of _UNK_
Research shows that the pursuit of happiness does not affect the _UNK_ of our lives .
If you &apos;ve reached a level of participation and meaning ,
So happiness can give you the _UNK_ of life .
So if three of them are , the entire life is greater than all parts .
Life is more empty than the sum of the parts .
Are there the same phenomena as life and productivity ?
Does the productivity be positive emotions , struggle and meaning ?
We have reason to believe that both answers are certain .
Chris said the last speaker had the opportunity to hear the _UNK_ he had before .
That &apos;s great for me , I never went to a party like this .
I &apos;ve never seen the speaker who &apos;s done that .
But I found that the problem of psychology
the problem of technology and entertainment and _UNK_
And they did that , and they did it .
by the way , reducing pain and creating happiness
30 years ago , when I first started _UNK_ ,
I think if I &apos;m going to reduce depression
to reduce anxiety , less anger , and I let them go .
And the best thing is that it &apos;s not that good .
in fact , the skills of happiness and happiness
In other words , these three power can be used to increase
But if you break up happiness like me ,
you see happiness is not just positive -- that &apos;s not enough --
_UNK_ also includes the meaning of life and life .
and can be used to enhance the meaning and participation in life .
is that we can use technology , entertainment and design
If technology can increase happiness in the next 10 years or 20 years .
in life , to make meaningful lives , enough .
And if the entertainment can add to positive emotion ,
And that &apos;s what we do with , and thank you .
Let &apos;s start with some of the best photographs
that the _UNK_ magazine was ready to publish
I &apos;m not sure how they &apos;re going to deal with this picture .
This jet landed in San Francisco by Bruce _UNK_ .
This is a picture of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
The polar bear that was filmed by the _UNK_
The polar bear is not good at swimming .
These are the _UNK_ in the Rift Valley .
The actual shadow of the camel in the picture .
This is a photograph of William _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
This is a photograph of the Spanish _UNK_ .
And David said that some of the things that happened in the dance floor
The Australian lion is playing their own dance .
This is a comet by Dr. _UNK_ _UNK_ .
The last one , no film star , is like a ship .
but the camera is still in its own power .
I went to play with my children four years ago .
The wave of _UNK_ is not a _UNK_ .
But the second wave that I turned turned turned turned turned around
And he was struggling with the banks of the _UNK_
I _UNK_ the water , and I _UNK_ him
It &apos;s like the slow camera _UNK_ in front of me .
And everything in the picture is so clear .
It &apos;s not a record of all my feelings .
_UNK_ is a relationship between the viewer .
And I told my son last week ,
And he said , &quot; Oh , I remember that .
and stand at the shore and shouting like , &quot;
What you see is a series of top _UNK_ photographer
in the top of the mountain work ,
and then submitted it to the National Geographic magazine ,
Last year we opened a new column of readers &apos; work .
that every one of us in our lives
And one of the two pictures of this
except that you could sell a good job
is to be able to make your pictures live .
The best photographer must know how to make a picture of _UNK_
I &apos;m going to show you a couple of examples
to give you a sense of the narrative power
and I &apos;m going to take some of these _UNK_ _UNK_
And the _UNK_ is starting to do that .
_UNK_ go to _UNK_ , trigger infrared , and take this picture .
but most of them are going to be
a _UNK_ came back from the water to his litter .
But elephant is the most important species in _UNK_ National Park .
This is one of the biggest _UNK_ in Africa .
in digital technologies that make _UNK_ make it easier .
The elephant &apos;s appearance has changed the whole story .
in the park , under the supervision of the _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ began to hunt for _UNK_ in the reserve .
A few _UNK_ are waiting to protect the _UNK_ .
and want to kill them for _UNK_ .
and the radio signals on the _UNK_
Anne died , and she had 20 members of her group ,
They went to a _UNK_ and found these _UNK_
but a story that makes us think about .
about the elephant , the _UNK_ of the elephant ,
And sometimes we can talk about a big topic
And what we saw was Richard _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The city population is more than the rural population .
Most of them are not living in the middle of the city ,
&quot; We should record all this , and I think ,
Let &apos;s go to the _UNK_ of every corner of the world . &quot;
I told him , &quot; You know , it needed a lot of money to do that . &quot;
in the same way that we have in the _UNK_ ,
in terms of the usual way of doing this ,
to get some of the things that are _UNK_
to give him a touch of the _UNK_
The city &apos;s important part of the inner and soul .
The final result of the _UNK_ is never _UNK_ .
_UNK_ the situation of the local _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
He saw a _UNK_ _UNK_ in the _UNK_
_UNK_ _UNK_ the soul of the community in record .
But sometimes , the _UNK_ picture is the only way to tell stories .
We &apos;re not the only media that we &apos;re talking about this topic .
in the _UNK_ of the human population ,
And Brian _UNK_ &apos;s risk of playing this picture .
The _UNK_ is selling fish to the local people .
The top of the _UNK_ has been in Europe
This is the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ in China .
And every time we do something like this ,
the species that had been missing at a time
This may be one of the solutions for sustainable fishing .
And last year in the TED TED _UNK_ ,
and the United States took a group of photos
that reflects the health care system in Iraq .
The medical care system looks like a pipe , and the _UNK_ goes into a drill .
The medical _UNK_ in this photograph will be injured .
by helicopter to _UNK_ to the _UNK_ hospital
And the one on the right side of this photograph
and the name of the distant daughter .
to the German institution in the back ,
And then they went back to _UNK_ and so forth .
_UNK_ made a story of a _UNK_ medical science .
and became human and deeply touched our readers .
and the photographer found that they were facing
A few of the things that were done before , some of the reasons
One of the most dangerous animals in the ocean
In fact , it was a year ago
a researcher had been killed in the depths of the sea ,
So you can imagine Paul was in the _UNK_
For _UNK_ seals , every day it &apos;s going to eat penguins .
If you allow _UNK_ to directors to become a journal ,
In this photograph a penguin came to the shore
And then you can get to the heart of the water
He said that he was not scared at the time .
And this girl is about four meters long .
It might be because the girl was curious about him .
to his honor , &quot; handsome , do you see me beautiful ? &quot;
Or you &apos;re saying , &quot; Well , your tooth is good . &quot;
Paul thought that this girl might think he was poor .
There was a big _UNK_ in the water .
I don &apos;t know why it &apos;s going to be
And she began to feed the penguin ,
But as soon as she got her mouth , these penguins immediately _UNK_ .
She looked at him and thought , &quot; This guy is not _UNK_ . &quot;
and then he turned to give him a couple of penguins .
And it took a few days to do that .
She was so disappointed to Paul that she had been disappointed .
And she sent penguins directly to his mouth ,
Why did the girl go home after he lost his final confidence .
But the last thing is that , except for a series of photos ,
is beyond the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
I believe photography can be a positive force .
I &apos;ve just begun to _UNK_ English a year ago , learning English .
I grew up in French , so my English was French .
I was born in the west of Congo
And after graduation , I came to this forest ,
When I was about 14 years old , I was in my uncle
My uncle is a _UNK_ and a _UNK_ .
And what I did in 14 to 17 years
and any of them killed in the forest , _UNK_ ,
to bring these _UNK_ into the market in _UNK_ .
When I was 17 to 20 , I became a _UNK_ .
What I do is I believe my school will continue .
I wanted to go to college , but my father was poor , and the uncle didn &apos;t have to say it .
I went to college in three to three years .
I apply for three times , and I want to be a doctor
I got my permission , and the biology department took me .
And I said , &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to learn about it .
My father was poor , and I had no good medical service .
I wanted to be a doctor to serve them .
And three times later , I began to _UNK_
When I graduated , I went to the forest _UNK_
is that I started working with passion for what I &apos;m doing now .
and it &apos;s going to come in front of you .
And there was a forest reserve in _UNK_
I think the number of _UNK_ in that time
We are now in a region of the Congo
There are 13 -- we can find the highest density in Africa .
I was in 1995 to join the _UNK_ Society
But in 1991 , when I was a student , I started working for them .
I was appointed as a _UNK_ for my university .
But I don &apos;t like the way that _UNK_ teaching
I thought that training centers and research centers
In _UNK_ , _UNK_ is the end of the _UNK_ ,
And you know , life becomes very difficult .
to be able to do it completely .
And so they started to _UNK_ from _UNK_
There was a road to _UNK_ , in this neighborhood ,
So they might have passed the _UNK_ reserve
There are five most abundant reserve in the Congo
And one of them is the _UNK_ reserve
that the soldiers _UNK_ the animals to protect them .
_UNK_ , war -- oh my God , you don &apos;t believe
Every one is looking for the way we don &apos;t know
especially for the first time we &apos;ve seen these young people ,
And even though all the people in the _UNK_
They didn &apos;t believe what happened in the past .
They _UNK_ the people , and they _UNK_ them .
You can &apos;t know their age because they have guns
but I came from the west , working in the East ,
And at that time I didn &apos;t even say _UNK_ ,
You can &apos;t say the _UNK_ , because it &apos;s the language of _UNK_ .
And I was from the same place ,
All my friends say that we &apos;d better leave because we &apos;ve become goal .
But I &apos;m not going to the east because I &apos;m not going to say _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to leave . If I &apos;m going to kill .
I can &apos;t go back to my _UNK_ -- that &apos;s 1,000 kilometers away .
We have a little dry , and there &apos;s _UNK_ plants
in the _UNK_ and the forests of bees ,
This is a guy who _UNK_ , a piece of leather .
with the soldiers , they went to the forest where they were _UNK_ ,
because he was leather , he knew how to track the elephant in the forest
He was attacked by the leopard , and the people _UNK_ him in the forest
They came to me and they said I saved them .
And what I did was I gave them some antibiotics .
I think every single cell in the city has a cellphone .
And _UNK_ was killed because of this ,
This area can find this _UNK_ , mining , across Congo .
And after the first war we lost everything , what I did
I saved something , including myself , my life and colleagues
I hide some of our new car engines to protect them .
on the top of the ceiling to save it .
He &apos;s not picking plants , but it &apos;s going to protect us .
because they want to destroy it , and they _UNK_ it .
They don &apos;t understand it , they don &apos;t have any learning .
And that &apos;s me , and I &apos;m going to go to Uganda .
I put that 4,000 samples in _UNK_ University
And after the war , I could bring them back
And the second war that we didn &apos;t realize
We are sitting together to watch football games .
And we &apos;re hearing that , in the Eastern War ,
I think _UNK_ will go to the same place as _UNK_ .
_UNK_ resources are the purpose of counter - insurgency .
three different sports and two _UNK_ , in the same region ,
That &apos;s some people who have power , we have to talk to them .
to convince them that we are in a region
_UNK_ , mining and _UNK_ are _UNK_ by special _UNK_ .
Do you think that those soldiers are not important ?
And the most important thing you have to protect
We have to do that because it makes our movement progress
I said , &quot; No , you can &apos;t do that . &quot;
And we started talking to them , and I was talking to them ,
trying to protect our equipment and try to protect our personnel
And sometimes they say my language , the _UNK_ ,
I heard their strategy and their plans
They &apos;re going to do it with me , and I &apos;m working on it .
This is my only device -- my satellite phone , my computer ,
and a solar panels that I hide in the forest
I went to write a quick email , sent it
I don &apos;t know how many people in my address are .
I sent the news about the progress of war
They began to wonder what we did in the morning
It was released in the BBC , the news of the _UNK_
And one day we went to meet the _UNK_
And he had a cell phone with me .
He asked me , &quot; How do you know how to use this ? &quot;
So that &apos;s a chance that they gave me a lot of trust
They didn &apos;t , they didn &apos;t look at me .
And when we ended the conference , I put it back into the forest ,
and every day with the United Nations , report to my New York institution ,
It &apos;s a great deal of pressure for those who leave and release that place .
They killed all the animals in the zoo
We have 14 _UNK_ , one of them was pregnant .
In the war , after a week of struggle , in this region ,
This is the only way to _UNK_ my pants and shirts .
They have protected the _UNK_ in the war .
because we put them out in the war ,
A week later we celebrate the birthday of the _UNK_ .
They kill elephants , just 50 meters away ,
I was opposed to them to _UNK_ it .
And I &apos;ve been released and I &apos;ve seen _UNK_
The elephant had just _UNK_ out of the _UNK_
What we &apos;re going to do after that , in the war like that ,
We have some money -- I &apos;m paid for 150 dollars .
I &apos;m going to contribute to one and a half of these plants
because we don &apos;t have a good infrastructure to grow
and began to raise money at every time I got to .
They gave me some support , and I built this .
At the same time , this is what we &apos;re doing .
My design is to follow global warming effects
And what happens in the forest is to absorb carbon dioxide
This is one of our 40 acres plans
This is the distance we tagged trees and _UNK_ .
to see how the forest can contribute to carbon emissions .
And then -- I think it &apos;s hard for me
I don &apos;t know where to start , from the end ,
I don &apos;t think about the best topic I &apos;m going to talk about .
But now I want to give it a name : &quot; No , no , no , no . &quot;
But the _UNK_ industry is a _UNK_ tool , or a game ?
I think we &apos;ve seen the rules of war
I suspect that many of you will have the same problems
I think help us , sometimes people will be ignorant of action .
Many of you have seen the intelligence of Africans
But there are few people who can go to school
A lot of people die because all of the diseases
that you can give us support , is to build all kinds of skills .
And then I went to -- now I was reading Dr. _UNK_ ,
But now many of them are because they don &apos;t have money .
It &apos;s not as difficult as aliens and dinosaurs .
The facial expression is very important because we communicate each other .
So we can see those very subtle things
It &apos;s possible that the computer is _UNK_ directly .
to make people believe that these are real .
And in the next five minutes , the next five minutes ,
to create a _UNK_ character through the computer .
and some of the partners from _UNK_ _UNK_
We &apos;re going to try to make a real _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ of the woman named _UNK_ was there .
It was actually a picture of her face with a computer _UNK_ .
At the end of the lecture , we &apos;ll see her moving .
And the way we tried was to get her
She was so elegant that she entered our lab
In _UNK_ , we sat down to the lights of our equipment .
This is a face scan ring with a white _UNK_ _UNK_ in it ,
We &apos;ve seen this in recent ways of using light .
We took all these pictures in three seconds .
by showing her the _UNK_ of her face ,
and the data from the light stage ,
If we look at the _UNK_ pictures ,
We can see her facial details in a very clear way .
because her face was _UNK_ in the same direction .
to get a very high quality of her face .
And we actually used it on all the lights .
The _UNK_ can be seen in the _UNK_ .
So we don &apos;t have to collect these _UNK_ points .
Now , if we _UNK_ a little bit more
And you &apos;ll see her face looks some _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
And if you take a couple of images ,
You get a synthetic image that &apos;s 360 degree of light ,
I don &apos;t think any of these images will be taken .
because the light will reflect the _UNK_ of the skin .
Now , it &apos;s a very good clue .
and all the details of the skin fold ,
In fact , these things make it look closer to human reality .
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
If we use the information from the _UNK_ ,
You can see the slight changes there on the forehead .
You can see the _UNK_ of muscles in her _UNK_ .
The muscles on her forehead will be such a expansion in her fear .
Because these cameras are collected , we have enough facial expressions to be _UNK_ .
through the different channels of color and brightness ,
We can use computer to add _UNK_ to skin .
She looks like she &apos;s going to be alive .
But they &apos;ve created some basic data programs for her ,
It actually moves in a way that it will be
to create some sort of _UNK_ replacement
And you can see different types of fold appeared in her animation .
So , the next step is to show her animation .
We actually use her own performance as a source of data .
by using computer vision to analyze these videos ,
So , we &apos;re going to see , through this process ,
We can make a little sound , if we can .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ _UNK_ is a kind of dynamic animation company .
_UNK_ : If we split it into various layers , this is the _UNK_ part .
We &apos;ve got five devices on the _UNK_ stage . This is a light stage .
This is Bruce _UNK_ , one of our developing teams ,
I &apos;d like to take him and run the data in the light stage .
So let &apos;s look at the emergence of the computer
It is a natural _UNK_ that many people believe it will be proven to the deepest pool of the world .
I said it was because it was not over .
There are a couple of great _UNK_ going on next year .
in a science fiction that shows the _UNK_ world ,
In the last 150 years , technology has allowed us to reach places
And we can now go down to thousands of meters of the planet .
We found the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
When we arrived at this point , we would often be there
Our team was 30 hours old , and a big _UNK_ .
Many people asked me that I was going to
What do you choose to take this project ?
It &apos;s not like NASA , but it &apos;s a complete thing .
If you want to know , this is our physical test .
The pressure is very important to the limits of human _UNK_ .
From the _UNK_ , this is never a cave like a commercial resort .
You see the _UNK_ camp , it &apos;s in _UNK_ , not the second peak ,
where we are about two days away from exports .
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ mountain in the direction ,
And the difference is that you take the rope down ,
It &apos;s a little bit comfortable in this underground environment .
_UNK_ around is completely wet , cold and dark places .
I should say , what you &apos;re looking at here
The more you go deeper , the more you have to resist the underground problem .
It &apos;s basically like a tree down the _UNK_ tree .
and you &apos;re going to get to a terrible place .
So I looked for a little clip at the end of the _UNK_ .
Now I &apos;m going to remind you of the technology
It &apos;s not going to be done unless it &apos;s to film .
In the same way , I &apos;m going to say
We &apos;ve never been able to do it at the bottom .
And once you go through the nearest _UNK_ ,
And the _UNK_ started to _UNK_ the members
I &apos;m going to take a international team next year
We &apos;re going to go down to the ground
The advance forces will continue to advance 30 days in the underground .
I thought I had not been _UNK_ for a long time .
And finally , if you go down to these caves ,
And the chance is that you &apos;re probably going to go into a
There &apos;s a fold that has a fold
People will mark straw terminal on the map .
I remember it . Because there are two reasons
First of all , it &apos;s my name of the rock band , second ,
a lot of devices that are going to be explored .
You can move around thousands of meters in the water now .
It &apos;s used to go deep into 200 meters of water .
When you walk in the water , it feels like a _UNK_ ,
But the risk of _UNK_ is also bigger .
And it allows you to figure out how to design your device
It allows you to take part of the place that humans have never been involved .
This is the last little _UNK_ on the planet .
Bill _UNK_ : The film was in the Florida Florida .
There are a few things that you can see
There was no place in 1999 before 1999 .
They &apos;re invented in two years and used to actually explore the project .
What you see here is the electronic _UNK_ --
It _UNK_ the first three - dimensional map in the world ,
And that was underwater in the water . It was underwater .
is that this little device is not going to open .
_UNK_ mentioned another planet called _UNK_ in the _UNK_ days .
to study the scientists of the planet
and believe that it &apos;s probably the most likely thing
One of the leading parts of the planet , life is in the open ocean of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s called &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot; --
&#91; Video &#93; : _UNK_ at the end of Europa ,
Europa is far away , even at the speed of light
The instructions are going to take more than an hour .
It must be wise to avoid all kinds of risks .
to find a good way to land
to find a good way to land
A week later , it _UNK_ the weight of himself
What do you do when you get to the sea ?
It has to be smart enough to be able to navigation
In the unknown ocean of the planet can make a decision .
Bill _UNK_ : Jim didn &apos;t know when he _UNK_ the film .
In six months , NASA had _UNK_ a team
I spent three years of engineering meeting , design ,
Like the movie description , this is a _UNK_ thing .
Take over ten kg of explosive in the area .
In northern Mexico , _UNK_ cartoon _UNK_ the world &apos;s hot spring .
Some people have been exploring the depths of the _UNK_ .
How do you do science in the ground automatically ?
how to make robots work in the wild ?
but I didn &apos;t have enough time to do it , but basically we did the robot
through this space , we let it detect the environment variable --
We calculated the _UNK_ surface , the robot climbed up the _UNK_ ,
We move along the wall , and this is what we call
If we meet what &apos;s interesting , we put it in the microscope .
If it &apos;s tested through the microscope , we &apos;ll collect samples .
Or we collected solid samples directly from the _UNK_ .
to be able to do it in a way .
It &apos;s called D _UNK_ , used to location and painting at the same time .
It &apos;s a light source that can go back and forth ,
In May , we &apos;re ready to move from a thousand meters ,
If we &apos;re lucky , deep water _UNK_ will take the first place
And then the second step in Antarctica is to test it , and then
If the funding license , and NASA has decided ,
We may begin to do this before _UNK_ ,
We may have the first evidence of life outside the planet ,
The American government recently announced plans to return back the moon .
the scientists and the pilot of the government
than 50 years ago , from the entire view of the universe ,
and there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s starting to do .
You have to have a fundamental change in the world ,
And what I &apos;m going to show you is some arguments .
I want you to hear me and believe
And what we &apos;re saying here is really _UNK_ .
The private exploration has three _UNK_ in space work .
_UNK_ _UNK_ and Richard _UNK_ , the founder of _UNK_
I &apos;ve been working on this , and I &apos;m giving them a honor .
The other thing we need is that the _UNK_ is in orbit .
First of all , we can do the space hotel ( tourism ) .
And the last point is , really , can _UNK_ the Earth
If it exists , it changes all the future spaceship and space exploration plans .
I &apos;m going to teach you a little bit about space infrastructure .
First of all , you &apos;re going to pay a fee for every job in space .
Secondly , the _UNK_ accounted for the weight of the spaceship .
So every time you want to do anything in the universe ,
And every time you step on the _UNK_ ,
Even if it was done , the _UNK_ could not _UNK_ the physical phenomenon .
So , what if you could get a 10 percent of the cost of fuel ?
In fact , it &apos;s cheaper -- you can get the price of _UNK_
It &apos;s called the _UNK_ Project of _UNK_ .
And the most amazing thing about this project
Only _UNK_ tons of water can produce it ,
And that water is the _UNK_ of the water .
If we &apos;re going to use this water to build a gas station ,
We must find a lot of ways to move in space .
And what people &apos;re doing now is from the Earth
We can do that because there is no air resistance in space .
We are almost always able to use the _UNK_ system .
And the idea is that in _UNK_ _UNK_
We can expand it to almost every other field .
Bob _UNK_ is currently testing a device on the space track .
We can establish space _UNK_ , load and water track platform .
you need to reduce the speed of 10,000 feet per second .
The speed of the gas station is slowed to the station .
You can burn the rocket , or you can do amazing things .
It &apos;s just about to _UNK_ the speed and return to the space station .
It &apos;s a big adventure , it &apos;s going to be better than Disney _UNK_ .
is that you take all the fuel needs
_UNK_ enough to ensure that every person is safe and able to cope with the emergency situation .
If you try to do that for the moon ,
A _UNK_ is going to cost a billion dollars .
Did anybody listen to the story of _UNK_ ?
It &apos;s not the story . I &apos;m more like the company .
I love _UNK_ , and I really care about it .
But if you &apos;re really bold you can get it there ,
It turns out that you can do something that &apos;s never done .
people say there &apos;s no billions of dollars and 20 years
It &apos;s not possible to make anything in space .
shows that humans can provide business activity on the _UNK_ track .
We are one of the most exciting times in human history .
and imagination is pushing people into space needs .
to create a new industry and a _UNK_
to break the pattern that needs a whole new way .
We can start a time as Lewis and _UNK_ across the United States .
They can become the foundation of commercial activity on orbit .
When people talk about space exploration , it seems to have deliberately deliberately deliberately _UNK_
As the end , I &apos;m going to make my promise at TED .
It can be done within seven years of support .
and I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
If they are here today , they are also _UNK_ .
People had been brave to open the frontier frontier frontier .
Mr. _UNK_ said , &quot; We need to move forward , &quot;
And now it &apos;s the same thing as it is .
I &apos;m going to put a _UNK_ on the moon .
the final task of opening the space _UNK_
There is no value : the possibility of something
This is a composition I wrote at 11 years old .
What I &apos;m going to talk about today is the art of creating ,
The conference was done in my 18 minutes .
If I &apos;m lying , or something that &apos;s not going to be _UNK_ .
David _UNK_ says he will be tough to ask me .
This is a graph of scientists in the audience
When I use &quot; our &quot; , I &apos;m not sure to mean you
but I said , and my brain , my _UNK_ ,
And there &apos;s something that &apos;s in the middle of them .
And I &apos;m going to talk about it ,
And I &apos;m going to talk about it ,
And I &apos;m going to talk about it ,
In _UNK_ , we have to look at it
Some people use other ways to say that this is our own .
Some people use other ways to say that this is our own .
is a kind of _UNK_ side effect --
is a kind of _UNK_ side effect --
is a kind of _UNK_ side effect --
that led him to the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
I think that really affects some of your brain
And I was writing a book on my desk
Some people say that the book is very different .
And one part is starting with the status crisis :
And I am , why am I here ?
but they may not be some creative skills .
I was painting before . I thought I would be a painter
It seems like _UNK_ , but it &apos;s really not a creative idea .
because what I can do is I just draw them all together .
And I was probably going to have a book
But what I really wanted was not that great .
You know , you look at those results , it &apos;s not _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s never going to let me predict
I could make a living by writing a day .
One of the principles of creativity is that childhood _UNK_
I think I have some injuries and people ,
from the parents who are too _UNK_ about their children .
is a toy I got when I was nine years old ,
to be a doctor in the childhood of _UNK_
And there are some psychological injuries that come from five to 15
But the truth is that there are some real psychological _UNK_ in my life
is to find my brother , in _UNK_ , and my father
My mother believed that some things were wrong .
She wanted to figure out why , and then resolve it .
My father is a priest , he believes _UNK_
He believes that God will solve the problems
But of course , they all died , six months in the middle
And after that , my mother believed that it was fate , was _UNK_ .
She searched all the possible reasons for the universe
except for all reasons . She didn &apos;t believe
And one of the reasons she believes in her mother
She believes that her mother had broken her in her childhood
So I was always _UNK_ by the shadows of death .
because my mother believed I would be the next , or she would be the next one .
And when you face the death of death ,
Some of the problems that I &apos;m still thinking about today
Why is it going to happen , how do they happen ?
and what my mother asked : How do I make these things happen ?
And this is a very important problem in writing stories .
because you have to answer these questions in 300 pages :
why it &apos;s going to happen , and how it &apos;s going to happen .
the sequence and the impact of the things
I , as a _UNK_ , what &apos;s going to happen to this story ?
And I think this is the problem of all scientists
And I &apos;m showing my world a little bit more
There &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ in the middle .
trying to create and try to create a _UNK_
And when I thought about _UNK_ , I thought ,
This comes from a _UNK_ view of every _UNK_ in everyday life .
I made a look at it in many events .
Let me make a metaphor for the quantum mechanics here :
but I &apos;m going to use it as a process
In quantum mechanics , there is dark energy and dark matter .
And as we try to explain what happens ,
There are many unknown , you don &apos;t know what that is , it &apos;s just not .
And when you want to be able to relate to the story ,
you suddenly see the core of things . It &apos;s meaning .
This is what I wanted in my work , for my meaning .
There &apos;s a _UNK_ principle in the quantum mechanics ,
You try to look at it in different directions ,
and you try to figure out how it works with other things ,
or what this story is about . If you &apos;re too _UNK_ ,
What you really want to find is that in _UNK_ ,
what happened on the other side of the universe ,
So here I &apos;m going to talk about _UNK_ ,
and there &apos;s a anxiety of eleven levels .
It &apos;s like you say the universe is constant .
You don &apos;t know what &apos;s running , but some things are working .
but it &apos;s still there . The moral uncertainty .
is always there . For example , for example ,
When I was in the editor , I read it .
And a woman was describing the war in Iraq ,
She used a very famous Chinese _UNK_ ,
That means that since we get into Iraq , we should have _UNK_
until it &apos;s done . You know , even though it &apos;s a hundred years
And there &apos;s another example of the same thing
But the _UNK_ still had to make a living .
In order to _UNK_ their lives , they claim to be _UNK_ fish
And one of the things that came from my mother
And the Chinese are always talking about it .
&quot; To save a _UNK_ , you will be responsible for his life . &quot;
&quot; To save a _UNK_ , you will be responsible for his life . &quot;
But I thought that if someone had really _UNK_ , she would rescue
But these two words , whether or save the fish ,
Or people who are _UNK_ , this depends on your intention .
We have to respond to what &apos;s happening in our lives .
that we should do , between the final two
that we should do , between the final two
Maybe it &apos;s over . If it &apos;s so , what is our responsibility ?
or try to _UNK_ our behavior and say , I &apos;m really good .
So I &apos;m not supposed to be negative .
and even let me write a book , which is called
Once you realize this problem , you find it _UNK_ .
And I also know that they &apos;ve been there all the time .
In writing , I saw these _UNK_ , these clues
I realized that they were all there , but there was no gap
And what I need is the focus of
When I had a question , it was a focus
that the _UNK_ in life would have been
And these problems , and what &apos;s happening in these events ,
and it &apos;s going to be able to do it .
You think it &apos;s just a _UNK_ event , or something happens .
It might be possible to come from the universe
and it can be explained that in the mind ,
You start looking at the things that are nervous
When your brother is in trouble , do you help him ?
It may be more serious than you think .
I thought I should not go , because somebody told me
But after a while , I &apos;m going to ask you
&quot; Why are we going to care about other people &apos;s ideas
And this is what I feel like in the process of growing up ,
And I was the father of the _UNK_
And finally I decided to go to _UNK_
And I still don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to be there .
and write a book , and how it works .
But I can only wait for the moment , to face these problems .
We always care about what we see in the world .
We said to ourselves , what can I do ?
not everyone can go to Africa or work in hospital
How do I deal with this _UNK_ in my body ?
And one of the important issues I think today
When I met these _UNK_ in moral _UNK_ , let me feel _UNK_ .
And I realized that this was the issue that I met again in my childhood .
Why am I here , what is the meaning of life
It looks pretty obvious , but it &apos;s a little bit _UNK_ .
In my writing , this is where I started .
sometimes seem to be helped by the universe .
My mother said that from the first one , inspiration to the ghost of her grandmother .
because I seem to know a lot about what I shouldn &apos;t know .
is because of excessive _UNK_ and accidental death ,
And in the story , the woman described it
My mother thought that these information must come to the ghost of the grandmother .
in writing , you know , there &apos;s a different kind of writing
It takes the history and the geography of that period
to _UNK_ the details of the story .
I took the book out of the shelf
My first page is the age and place in my story .
and the characters that I wanted to describe the sky ,
in a place that is close to _UNK_ ,
and a man who thinks he is the son of God .
But what &apos;s happened ? What &apos;s the chance ? What is luck and luck ?
What is the inspiration of the things that come up with ?
These are the things that I think about every day
But I was convinced that this was an inspiration
And I want to know what the elements they form
And I can thank you , and find them
because I think the more I can see them , the more they &apos;re going to happen ,
And there was another place that was a place
I &apos;m just driving a car with my friends .
In the third valley , I have some mysterious , _UNK_ .
I know it &apos;s going to be my story scene .
And one of the stories happened in the third valley ,
And one of these acts I wrote , a man , is _UNK_ ,
I don &apos;t know why I write this , but it &apos;s pretty obvious .
I was in a dilemma , a friend asked me not to walk with her dog .
And I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to talk about it for a minute .
He &apos;s _UNK_ these things . No glue , no tools .
I asked him , how could this be possible ?
He said that every thing in the world has a _UNK_
And that &apos;s the key to my story .
And it &apos;s often going to happen in my writing ,
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_
is it that I have a special _UNK_

is it that I have a special _UNK_

And here , what I &apos;d like to say to you
These books come back . When it comes to me , it &apos;s no longer in me ,
And in every reader , they have different _UNK_ .
And in every reader , they have different _UNK_ .
and tell me that it doesn &apos;t have a definite answer .
and what happened in the story at the time .
And I also believe that in terms of these ,
about luck , fate , _UNK_ and accidents ,
_UNK_ , when they &apos;re interacting with these mysterious forces ,
I &apos;m going to be some of our creative ideas .
I think of my role in the universe
Is anybody who wants me to be this now , or is it entirely out of me ?
I can imagine the answer , or become my own imagination .
In that real world , _UNK_ the world ,
This is the way I find some truth , not absolute , or completely true truth ,
_UNK_ , it was for me to remind myself .
That &apos;s a good thing because I always find new things .
That &apos;s a good thing because I always find new things .
Imagine being able to put it into the story ,

I have to be part of the story to understand
What I &apos;m going to reveal in the bag is that inspiration

How did a _UNK_ company improve their sales by making only one thing they did .
How did a _UNK_ company improve their sales by making only one thing they did .
How did a _UNK_ company improve their sales by making only one thing they did .
Frank _UNK_ is how to _UNK_ the meaning of an architect .
One of the biggest mistakes in the past few years ,
create a record company , issued a record called _UNK_ .
I must tell you that a guy named _UNK_ _UNK_ and a story of his bread .
Well , the _UNK_ is invented before _UNK_ the bread .
Well , the _UNK_ is invented before _UNK_ the bread .

And I think that what you want is ,
you want to change , you want to make it happen ,
you want to change , you want to make it happen ,
and you &apos;re running a _UNK_ for me ,
Or you &apos;re a _UNK_ , or you &apos;re a businessman , and you &apos;re driving a hot balloon .
This applies to any profession you &apos;re doing , whatever we &apos;re doing .
This applies to any profession you &apos;re doing , whatever we &apos;re doing .
Only a man who knows how to spread is the winner .
I usually talk about it as an example of business .
because I can put the best _UNK_ in my eyes
because I can put the best _UNK_ in my eyes
because I can put the best _UNK_ in my eyes
because I can put the best _UNK_ in my eyes
because I can put the best _UNK_ in my eyes

because I can put the best _UNK_ in my eyes
and then _UNK_ more of their products .
Finally , you make more ads for the money .
Finally , you make more ads for the money .
And the pattern that we &apos;ve heard yesterday ,
And if we look at Google _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And if we tried to get the top of it ,
If we could catch the people &apos;s _UNK_ ,
and tell them what we want to do .
If we do that , everyone will attract attention , so we can achieve a goal .
Yes , the TV industry centers inspired my childhood and your whole childhood .
I mean , all the successful products are because some people know
How do you use a _UNK_ approach to people ,
in a way that doesn &apos;t need a ad ,
and then they bought it again and again .
And then one thing happened , everyone left the television off .
The former method of work has been lost now .
This picture is _UNK_ , I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s my cold .
The blue box is what I want to say .
Yes . I went to the _UNK_ . I was ill . I needed some medicine .
The product manager spent 100 million dollars in that blue box .
with 100 million dollars to make television ads and magazine advertising ,
So I ignored them because I didn &apos;t have any questions about it .
I bought the yellow box because I used it all the time .
I &apos;m not going to take any minute out of my time to deal with her ,
I &apos;m not going to take any minute out of my time to deal with her ,
I &apos;m not going to take any minute out of my time to deal with her ,
It was only on Saturday , the journal _UNK_ and News _UNK_ .
It was only on Saturday , the journal _UNK_ and News _UNK_ .

_UNK_ through the city to buy a beef sandwich .
He is always talking to a man who needs to listen to you .
The world _UNK_ me around me every day , I , I , my favorite .
I don &apos;t want to get any email , I just want to get my email . &quot;
So consumers , I &apos;m not talking about people in the mall ,
I mean , those who might need to buy something ,
or those who are in New York may print your article .
The consumers don &apos;t care about you , they &apos;re _UNK_ .
And the reason is that they have more choices than they &apos;ve been ,
There &apos;s a lot of choices that we have .
And in the limited world , we will probably have some blind eyes .
For example , when you &apos;re driving on the road ,
If you see a cow , then you &apos;re going to drive
Who _UNK_ the car on the side and said to someone -- a cow . No one will do that .
But if the cow is purple -- that &apos;s really cool ?
If you want me to repeat the time .
If the cow is purple , you may look at it .
I mean , if all the cows are purple , you &apos;ll be bored .
One thing it can decide what people talk about ,
It &apos;s a really cool word because we often understand it as _UNK_ ,
It also means -- it &apos;s worth us to talk about .
This is the essence of the idea of spreading .
One of the two _UNK_ in the United States is worth $ _UNK_ ,
big enough to put a car in its trunk .
People are willing to buy them all , but they are the only common ones .
The first _UNK_ in the United States are changing every week .
They &apos;re usually _UNK_ with some _UNK_ film _UNK_ ,
But it became the first reason that it was released this week .
because you see it -- I don &apos;t know it &apos;s there --
two of the most successful stories in the last 20 years --
One is to sell something in the blue box ,
The other is to sell what they &apos;re making as much cheaper .
The only thing they do is they &apos;re very different .
It &apos;s been popular to do business in order to survive ,
And one thing is that the clothing industry
I know what the industry will look like , because they are accustomed to it .
We have to figure out how to think about it .
How do you understand that this is not about using big pages to _UNK_ people ,
This is a completely different way to determine what &apos;s going to happen ,
This is a completely different way to determine what &apos;s going to happen ,
because they _UNK_ the meaning of the sale chair .
The chair is not just the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but the symbol of your identity in the workplace
This guy , he called _UNK_ _UNK_ , the world &apos;s most famous _UNK_ --
He was the _UNK_ of my heroes .
He lives in Paris . He sold up _UNK_ million dollars a year .
Every bread was done in his own _UNK_ , a _UNK_ devoted to a bread , in a wooden oven .
At first , _UNK_ made his French bread very _UNK_ .
They don &apos;t want to buy this bread . It doesn &apos;t look like French bread . &quot;
But it &apos;s because of the _UNK_ and _UNK_ of the bread ,
Until the last , it became the official bread of Paris .
_UNK_ is now living in London , and his bread is being _UNK_ around the world .
Our stores used to produce ordinary goods to give us ordinary people .
But the world at the center of a television industry
I think this is not a sales strategy that we will continue to use .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s not going to sell that thing .
the people who are interested in things .
the individuals on the remaining curve and it will spread .
They have something I call _UNK_ -- this is a great Japanese word .
And it was used to describe the _UNK_
For example , they drive through Tokyo to taste a new _UNK_ ,
because it was what they did . They were obsessed with it .
because it was what they did . They were obsessed with it .
In other hand , you have to find a group of people ,
Those who are really , are willing to listen to you .
and they talk and they can easily pass your ideas to friends .
There is a _UNK_ here , but there is no _UNK_ of mustard .
This is why there &apos;s a lot of different kinds of _UNK_ ,
But no one would be obsessed with the mustard ,
They have a strategy , and what they do ,
into a city , to communicate with people
The _UNK_ sold $ _UNK_ , but it was only twelve minutes .
They just want to tell people about it , maybe they can spread .
These guys built the largest sound of the world .
It &apos;s got to be close to Boeing 747 , so you &apos;ve got a _UNK_ .
I want to put a couple of _UNK_ into my car ,
It &apos;s really simple -- to sell something to you ,
Maybe , just maybe those people will listen to their friends .
So , Steve Jobs had a conversation with 50,000 people , right ?
And that &apos;s the only key to getting his company to work normally --
Look at him two hours and tell their friends .
_UNK_ band , recently released a _UNK_ album in two years .
Those people who buy album online are _UNK_ .
and they &apos;ll tell their friends , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
The special _UNK_ sold 10,000 dollars , much more expensive than ordinary ones .
but they buy them faster than other _UNK_ hospitals .
But as long as they like it , they would be crazy about it .
The coatings in the eyes saved the Dutch boys to paint companies ,
and finally become their wealth . It &apos;s more expensive than usual coatings .
and finally become their wealth . It &apos;s more expensive than usual coatings .
not only do they make a new ad on the product ,
but they _UNK_ the paint of traditional meaning .
&quot; My red - red website -- every day there &apos;s _UNK_ people ,
The website is run by two volunteers , and I can tell you they &apos;re very _UNK_ , but
They didn &apos;t have any brains to put more ads on it .
This is a _UNK_ with a wire frame ,
And every one of the people in his office
Everybody wants to know how the frame is to come to his table .
Every time there &apos;s a guy like this , it &apos;s going to be spread .
You can also turn your bones into stones after you are _UNK_ .
But you don &apos;t need to be a _UNK_ --
You don &apos;t have to be as _UNK_ as he is .
What you &apos;re going to do is figure out what people want and give them .
The first is that when you reach a scale is free .
the people who invented different kinds of things
is that people who know how to use good design
Second : _UNK_ is the most risky thing .
That &apos;s a risky thing . It &apos;s in the edge of the brain ,
It feels that it &apos;s one of the worst things you do .
whether you &apos;re making a album or not ,
Or you &apos;re a architect , or you &apos;re in the _UNK_ .
If one is good , it will not produce effect because no one will look at it .
First of all , silk companies . They &apos;re going to make their own _UNK_ products .
For those who look at the _UNK_ regions ,
It &apos;s a different kind of art . You don &apos;t like it ,
but a 40 feet high in the bush
It &apos;s a very different thing in the middle of New York City .
And the people who built the world wanted to look at the building .
Everybody says we need a architect -- Frank -- can _UNK_ come ?
because he did some strange things about him .
Is it my fault ? I took out a whole set of
And the album , I hope they all have
_UNK_ format -- this is a new storage format --
And I sold it to a family and 20,000 dollars _UNK_ .
So you have to figure out who really care about your products .
who would raise their hands and say ,
As you can see , it &apos;s in a _UNK_ place .
People used to come out of several miles , and _UNK_ was able to swim in the water .
But now it doesn &apos;t work . So our founder says , &quot; We &apos;re rich .
But what do we do ? &quot; Like most of the _UNK_ ,
And then I went to an artist -- this is a real artist --
He wanted to build a _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ in the centre .
I don &apos;t know if you build it , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to go .
I want to share with you this morning
because I fell in love with the ocean when I was a kid .
all the amazing things I see in the water ,
The extraordinary experiences I met at the sea .
And I couldn &apos;t get my camera to these problems ,
The first story was that I worked for National Geographic ,
It &apos;s just a little bit of attention , in a few years ,
And these animals are _UNK_ and mating and _UNK_ .
to the Gulf of Canada in Canada .
I want to talk about this story from underwater and water ,
to take pictures , like this , showing one of these little seals ,
In the cold , 29 _UNK_ began its first swimming in the water .
But as I was more involved in this report ,
I know there are two ways I can &apos;t ignore the big environment .
The first is that these animals are constantly _UNK_ ,
At about eight to 15 times the _UNK_ was killed .
There are hundreds of seals that _UNK_ remember every year .
Because the global warming leads to the reduction of _UNK_ .
And the aerial picture that I showed you
In Greenland seals multiply the _UNK_ of the season .
And although we see a lot of ice in the picture ,
and there &apos;s a lot of water over the past .
And the ice is very thin , very thin .
The problem is to get their mother &apos;s care , these little seals need
to take care of them for about 12 days .
a little seal about five to seven days --
And it had a little _UNK_ on its _UNK_ --
It &apos;s because it &apos;s too thin to _UNK_ the sea ,
It &apos;s crazy to try to get it up to breathe ,
Since I was there , the problem was _UNK_ every year .
I found that last year , in the Bay of Lawrence ,
The death rate of small seals is 100 percent .
So , obviously , this species faces a lot of problems .
This became a cover of the National Geographic .
And there &apos;s this attention , and I see the beginning
So I took a report on the global fish crisis ,
And the problem is that in the oceans ,
And the problem is that in the oceans ,
has disappeared in the past 50 or 50 years .
like tuna , and the sharks and sharks .
And when I read these , I was _UNK_ by these numbers .
I think this should be the headlines of all media .
But it wasn &apos;t , so I wanted to do it .
This is a completely different story from underwater reports .
I want it to be more like a war camera ,
The first part of the story , I think it &apos;s essential to any matter ,
Well , I think when people walk into the restaurant ,
a little _UNK_ , we all know where _UNK_ is ,
And a little chicken , we know what chickens are ,
How many of the great animals they are eating ?
Now , they are the lion and the tiger in the oceans .
And they can be _UNK_ in the entire ocean a year .
If we don &apos;t catch them like this , they &apos;ve been growing , in the end of life ,
We could see a _UNK_ tuna that could be 30 years old .
But the truth is that we have the efficiency
This is a few years ago I built fish markets
This is a few years ago I built fish markets
This is a few years ago I built fish markets
And in this report , I want to show the reader
how fish is caught and some ways to fishing ,
As a _UNK_ boat , this is one of the most common fishing methods in the world .
This is a small network used in Mexico ,
This is a small network used in Mexico ,
And when this device was dropped in the water ,
And then they put a _UNK_ and a wire at the bottom .
And then , by the end of this line , _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
But as you can think about it , it will catch everything on its route .
And this would destroy the precious _UNK_ community ,
and took him to the shrimp for an hour .
Now , he harvest several shrimp , maybe seven or eight shrimp ,
And all the other animals on the deck are _UNK_ .
This is the real cost of eating a shrimp ,
and 10 pounds of other animals that die in the catch .
And to make this more intuitive , I went down to the bottom of the ship ,
And I want to focus on sharks ,
But before I go out to the photograph ,
I &apos;m going to take a picture of how to die .
Well , I think there &apos;s still a lot of people
But in a morning I found this _UNK_ ,
And it just died in this little room .
It &apos;s a big fin and a eye _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s kind of like Jesus _UNK_ me , if you want to say that .
And I want it to help the reader
And because I love sharks -- I &apos;m fascinated by sharks --
I want to do another , more happy reports about sharks ,
to talk about the necessity of protecting sharks .
In the _UNK_ Islands , the number of sharks seem very healthy ,
This is a very large part of the local government
There &apos;s no species in the magazine . They live in a lot of places .
There &apos;s a place called the _UNK_ beach ,
shows that around our diving ships around a massive old age ,
But I &apos;m absolutely not going to let this cover .
It &apos;s going to continue to be a bit like a monster .
I don &apos;t want them to be _UNK_ or scary .
I think I &apos;m a little bit of a goal ,
She _UNK_ in the water , some _UNK_ around her ,
My light bulb produced a shadow in her face .
And I think this picture is more elegant , less dangerous ,
But the animals are either in Florida or in Florida .
We don &apos;t know where they &apos;re going to go ,
It cuts about _UNK_ in the last 20 years .
You know , we &apos;re finding them faster and faster .
One of the four species in the _UNK_ species ,
But the number of animals , in most of them ,
because it &apos;s a sea sea creature , and it lives in deep water ,
My friend , the shark biologists are in this cage .
And of course , you &apos;re going to see photographer not in the cage ,
It &apos;s obvious that biologists are smarter than the photographer , I think .
And I want to look at the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And in order to look at the lemon ,
This is a picture of the lemon _UNK_ ,
And the picture shows that these animals live in the first three years
This is not a picture of sharks that are usually meant .
But you know , we see a 10 or 11 feet long .
But this is important habitat that they spend three years of life ,
until they had enough strong enough to swim to the hidden reef .
This is a report that I recorded _UNK_ .
The history of this animal can go back to about 100 million years ago .
And they &apos;re going to be able to do it in the water ,
is going to try to _UNK_ the first time ,
For example , the _UNK_ _UNK_ on the beach
but they can &apos;t deal with the pressure of human beings ,
A _UNK_ was caught in a _UNK_ at night .
_UNK_ the turtle from the _UNK_ so it can walk free .
But you know , there are thousands of _UNK_
is that it &apos;s the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
And basically , the story about _UNK_ is this ,
But when the continents move , the ocean is _UNK_ ,
What we see here is the south _UNK_ ,
And what you see here is the North Atlantic ,
The _UNK_ took the children off the coast of Florida .
Now , these two _UNK_ have been _UNK_ to death
But the number of southern _UNK_ is bigger ,
because they are _UNK_ , they live in North America ,
They had to deal with some of the _UNK_ .
This picture shows a _UNK_ coast of Florida on the _UNK_ .
You can see the electric _UNK_ in the background .
They have to face some of the things that are being _UNK_
This picture shows a rear end of the _UNK_ .
But most of them don &apos;t get rid of these fishing chains , such as _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
These devices catch them and eventually killing them .
Another question is that they &apos;re going to be _UNK_ .
It &apos;s only _UNK_ animals , and it &apos;s in Canada .
So all of these _UNK_ up to this animal ,
And in order to compare the number of North Atlantic ,
I found a primitive data of the _UNK_ population ,
I found a primitive data of the _UNK_ population ,
In New Zealand , a number of south _UNK_ in the Antarctic _UNK_ .
and the animals that had never seen before .
And I might be the first person they saw .
And I was surprised by the curious part of them .
In this photograph my assistant stood at the sea of about 70 feet deep .
It &apos;s like a city bus is swimming , you know .
You know , when the _UNK_ is in _UNK_ ,
wrote that you could _UNK_ the back of the _UNK_
And we can &apos;t go back to the _UNK_ moment ,
but maybe we can make it available now .
I &apos;d like to end with a very hopeful story ,
_UNK_ the problem of fishing problems and global fish crisis .
I lived in New Zealand and worked there ,
is a pretty good thing to protect their ocean .
And I really want this report to be related to three things .
They hope and look forward to what &apos;s going on .
For example , they want some kinds of fish
because they &apos;ve been caught on the edge of commercial fish .
And they actually come back . There are other things they didn &apos;t expect .
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ appears to be a big _UNK_ .
Well , this may be the oceans here ,
It was like 100 or 100 years ago , but no one could tell us that it was not .
I &apos;ve been working in other parts of New Zealand ,
As a _UNK_ , there was a _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
The blue _UNK_ _UNK_ the color of the _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to have some warm water in the blue ,
It &apos;s a very important animal in this ecosystem ,
because it &apos;s hunting at the sea and makes new life _UNK_ .
This picture is a day I photographed in New Zealand ,
And I was only in the place where I was
I was talking to the _UNK_ _UNK_ for years ,
They say that the oceans here are more _UNK_
And the oceans do have some _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
And I &apos;m going to do this today because I want to protect her ,
I &apos;ve been working on the Internet for 10 years .
the simple solution to the problems of life
Now people use the network game for three or three billion hours .
&quot; It takes so many hours to play games . &quot;
There &apos;s a lot of urgent problems that we need to deal with .
Every three - dimensional game game is far less difficult for solving real life .
Every three - dimensional game game is far less difficult for solving real life .
In fact , I think it &apos;s better to live on the planet
is that every week of _UNK_ hours a week
It may be a little bit against the common sense .
But I &apos;d like to _UNK_ it so that it was fully understood
is that the game is about the race
to live in the future . It &apos;s really important .
This is a portrait taken by _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So , he put the camera in front of the game ,
you don &apos;t look at the real meaning of this picture .
Or it &apos;s going to focus on a problem .
The fold around the eyes is upward , including the fold around the mouth .
That means that this game is going to win _UNK_ in the game .
You can &apos;t even think of success before you get this win .
And this is what &apos;s called &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
And the player is going to win that way .
At the same time , this is the next century ,
the expression of all kinds of obstacles
Now , unfortunately , when we deal with all kinds of emergency events ,
Now , unfortunately , when we deal with all kinds of emergency events ,
I usually call this a &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
In fact , can I make this thing out of the _UNK_ ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing , &quot; It &apos;s not going to be good at living . &quot;
This is what I did in a college college in California
And I read Dr. _UNK_ , &quot; Why do we think virtual games are better than the world . &quot;
And this is a difficult problem for many game players .
We felt that we couldn &apos;t adapt to real life in the game .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a success .
We actually have more success in the game world .
And the news that we &apos;ll be able to help others
and we &apos;re going to be brave to stand up and continue to struggle .
When we encounter obstacles , we usually don &apos;t feel that .
And we didn &apos;t feel that at that time .
So , I studied some of these games like _UNK_ ,
is that these things make _UNK_ victory in the network
The first thing is that whenever you see these networks ,
They trust you and help you to save the world .
But it &apos;s not all the tasks that are ,
designers don &apos;t give you a job that you can &apos;t do .
But the task needs to play your limit , so you have to do the best
there &apos;s been some very special things that are important to wait for you to finish .
There is no such thing in real life .
There &apos;s a wonderful story in the game , and the plot
You &apos;re sure that you &apos;ve heard about the hierarchy ,
And we don &apos;t have that continued feedback in real life .
For example , when I was in this stage , I wouldn &apos;t have any
because we can &apos;t stop the end of the victory .
And it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to have the _UNK_ world
And so far , the game of _UNK_ has spent the entire year
The human ancestors began to walk upright ,
So , when we talk about how long we spend on games ,
The only way to make this sense is to go to _UNK_
in the course of the human evolution ,
We are becoming a more _UNK_ and more powerful species .
The survey was published by a researcher at _UNK_ University
First of all , the children in the United States
And the time for that is that there is a lot
So you &apos;re not going to be so _UNK_ about the success theory .
So we must have a great success in these things .
So we must have a great success in these things .
They are the ones that we have now
It takes at least an hour to play the network game ,
500 million people out there in the world
And if I ever told you that this is going to happen
Now , what it does is that it &apos;s not ,
According to forecast , there will be a billion new players in the next 10 years .
And then we &apos;ll have the _UNK_ game player .
So , I started to think about it ,
I think there are four ways . First of all , positive thinking about emergency ,
I think there are four ways . First of all , positive thinking about emergency ,
I think there are four ways . First of all , positive thinking about emergency ,
They &apos;re very good at creating a society structure ,
We prefer those who are _UNK_ with us .
And the reason is that we accumulate trust in the game
The reason we trust is that they spend the same time
The reason we trust is that they spend the same time
And based on this , the game can actually build
And based on this , the game can actually build
The average cost of the World of _UNK_
is because when we play the game ,
We will make us feel better and happier .
And as a species of human beings ,
and they would never stop trying to play .
Any little bit of detail you do will be part of the final vision .
You &apos;ve heard about Wikipedia , the largest _UNK_ in the world , is a _UNK_ system .
And the second largest _UNK_ in the world
of the _UNK_ of the World of _UNK_ .
is that there are more and more people
This is the example of the four _UNK_
They think they have the ability to change the world .
Not like me , I &apos;m just a game designer , I &apos;m full of dynamic .
than the things that live in real life
than the best social relationships in real life .
So , he said that for game players ,
more time in virtual space than in the real world .
Now I still think it &apos;s very rational .
But anyway , this is not the best option .
We have to start building the real world as a game .
So , I went from the _UNK_ _UNK_
These are ancient dice that are made by the _UNK_ of sheep .
If you compare the work of the Greek historian ,
The king decided to do some crazy things they had to do
But the next day , all of you can only _UNK_
people are absorbed in playing dice games ,
people forget the fact that they don &apos;t have any food ,
The next day people will be able to pass
And they went through the _UNK_ of _UNK_
We &apos;ve been able to avoid the real world
It &apos;s not a matter of _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
So the king decided to play the last dice game
The victory of the game will be on a adventure trip .
to find a new place to live in .
to have the same gene that we have .
And this can explain the origin of the _UNK_ .
They _UNK_ how to get people together in the game .
and it &apos;s going to save the whole civilization .
And this is what happened in the 16 years ago .
So I _UNK_ that we are ready to accept a game that can change our lives .
And we now have about 30 hours a week
You might ask , &quot; How do we solve the real world ? &quot;
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing in the last few years .
This is the ad we &apos;re in the office in _UNK_ .
It gives us a sense of how we look at the future .
We &apos;re not going to try to predict the future .
But we &apos;re going to create the future
and also give people the way to win ,
I want to give you a quick introduction of three games I &apos;ve done .
And they &apos;re all trying to do it ,
This is a network game , which is a network game ,
you think that &apos;s true , and it &apos;s going to affect your real life .
Let &apos;s feel that we don &apos;t use oil . So when you open the game ,
to be registered and tell us that your address
What is _UNK_ , how food supplies are affected .
If this is true , you &apos;ll find out how to deal with these problems
we &apos;re going to ask you to release these things on blogs .
In 2007 , there were _UNK_ people in this game ,
And we followed these three years of life
I can tell you that this is a very _UNK_ experience .
or because they think it &apos;s _UNK_ , or because they think it &apos;s _UNK_ .
But if you let them have a extraordinary experience ,
It &apos;s going to be a wonderful story and an unusual experience .
Most game players retain their habits in the game .
Our choice is more difficult than oil shortage .
_UNK_ found that humans survived 23 years on Earth
You know the film , you organize a _UNK_ ,
They have a lot of strength to save the world .
In our design game , we don &apos;t use five groups
We designed to be part of the elite .
your responsibility is to develop the development of
and the security system and the network of security
We &apos;ve got 8000 people playing this game , playing eight weeks .
If you go to Google _UNK_ , you can see the results
We &apos;re going to be online in March . This game is done with the World Bank of _UNK_
And if you can finish the game ,
We are inviting them to engage the skills of social innovation .
The game is more like a cartoon novel .
We have these games that are probably what we &apos;re going to do in the future .
But there &apos;s nothing to save the real world
I want you to agree with my ideas .
I want you to agree with my ideas .
_UNK_ can live on this planet in the next century .
And I want you to join us ,
First of all , we can create any future we can imagine
because I think we &apos;re going to live in the last 150 years
It will be below 10 billion and will be _UNK_ in the end of this century .
In that time , the population will begin to fall .
Most of the economic models have been established in lack and growth ,
One , a set of land , added up to less people .
In the city , a big part of the estate
The burden of poverty and the _UNK_ will further slow .
And of course , I &apos;m not talking about the black Death .
Most of our culture _UNK_ to the past ,
All the Western religions are starting to _UNK_ the idea of Eden ,
And after the curve gets to the top two generations ,
And then we &apos;re going to be able to _UNK_ the future ,
The _UNK_ of the future will become strong and powerful .
The fear of the future will lead to a _UNK_ choice .
And if we were all in the future ,
we can accelerate the turning point to that point ,
And if we could spend the next 150 years ,
And one day I was walking with my wife ,
At first I saw , a very sick chimpanzees .
I was going to be back to the town this evening .
Well , I found a little chimpanzees on the garbage pile .
And now the _UNK_ live in the _UNK_ forest ,
In fact , _UNK_ was the second child I saved from chimpanzees .
So today , in my two centers , there are nearly a thousand _UNK_ .
It &apos;s terrible . But it turns out that we can &apos;t get back to life .
It only indicates that everyone fails to do what they should do .
It only indicates that everyone fails to do what they should do .
This is a _UNK_ of 20 meters long ,
is the most organic material in the world .
My country has become the third largest country in global warming ,
And we are a country that has no industrial power .
I &apos;m not going to spend too much time talking about this ,
But there &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ members
And unfortunately , it still lives in the forest
And I don &apos;t know where the _UNK_ are going to be .
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution
and it also gives people the same benefit in the forest .
If I could do that in the worst places I thought ,
So no one would have an excuse to say , &quot; _UNK_ , but _UNK_ .
So we &apos;re in the Eastern island . This is where I started .
What &apos;s not there , it &apos;s just a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
In 2002 we have nearly _UNK_ million people here .
The local people spent a lot of money in the water
This is the poorest part of the world .
When I stand on this grass , I only feel hot -- there &apos;s no _UNK_ sound --
In spite of these four years , we offer _UNK_ jobs .
We have more than a thousand species , and now there are _UNK_ birds .
So what &apos;s happening here ? We &apos;ve made huge economic damage in the forest .
have been able to slow down the surface ,
So they burn half the trees and half the current minerals .
And you &apos;ve been _UNK_ a little bit later .
You can see our first office in the mountains ,
After four years , a green area appears on the surface of the earth --
And here &apos;s these animals , these happy people ,
If you look at this step , you &apos;ll find it very simple :
We bought this piece , and we worked with fire ,
At that time we set up infrastructure , management , and financial measures .
But we have to determine every single local population
are all involved in the project of _UNK_ .
so that there &apos;s no force in the outside world .
It makes the local people a _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
People say it belongs to me , it belongs to _UNK_ .
and how did it go from the beginning
You can control the factors , you create a formula .
No matter how to choose technology , fertilizer , or _UNK_ .
and you look at the results and measure it .
In this formula you have the cost of the cost .
If you can put this formula on the map ,
You configuration these different recipes ; if you combine them together ,
and the work plan from it , you can make it optimized .
that can be available for existing labor , or existing fertilizer ,
This is what it looks like . We &apos;re going to get rid of the grass .
The _UNK_ is a very low plant value .
But we need them to _UNK_ the soil ,
When eight years later , there might be some timber ,
So if you can maintain it in the right way ,
So if we start to grow the bamboo ,
We &apos;re going to take the risk of losing everything .
to give the product to the original product .
And the idea is , how do you take a certain amount of time and space ,
Use a limited tool and strategy , _UNK_ resources .
So we plant these trees , and we grow _UNK_ .
_UNK_ beans and ginger in them to reduce competition between trees and trees ,
_UNK_ -- organic matter is useful for crop ,
It also helps trees grow , farmers have free land ,
The system got early gains , and _UNK_ also got healthy food .
Well , because if you look at what happened in 1998 ,
This is an area of about _UNK_ _UNK_ .
We lost a _UNK_ in a few months .
because we have 10,000 times of this underground fire
There is also a lot of _UNK_ in the United States .
Once the soil becomes dry , the _UNK_ will emerge ,
oxygen _UNK_ and fire _UNK_ occur , the problem will be re - starting .
This is what it looks like in three months .
In three months , the automatic lighting of the _UNK_ had not gone out .
We lost all crops , and there was no child to increase weight .
They lost 12 points of intelligence ; it was for chimpanzees and people
So the fire is the first task to deal with .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m here to make it a single point .
You need local people , because of these _UNK_ ,
Once you start burning , it &apos;s going to be like a storm .
that you lose the final _UNK_ of the _UNK_
until the first rain went to _UNK_
So , you have to do it with the local people .
The above is only a short - term solution , and you need a long - term solution .
And the palm tree formed a fire fire .
and have a lot of income for the local people .
people just _UNK_ up these trees , two times a day ,
It &apos;s just a little bit of a _UNK_ ,
the carbon dioxide , the rainfall and a little bit of sunlight ,
because they can produce three times more energy every year ,
because you can do it in everyday work ,
You can make lots of energy from here .
So this is the potential that we can combine
It &apos;s not developed , and it &apos;s being done by technology .
But you have to have a very good legal knowledge
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re starting to do ,
If you zoom in a little bit , you can see all the areas
have been _UNK_ by different kinds of soil ,
It measured in 5,000 days , 2,000 _UNK_ in broad fields .
What we really do is we only believe nature ,
And that means that the forest can use better
the ground and the light above the ground ,
you can store more carbon in the ecosystem and provide _UNK_ ,
But it &apos;s also more complicated , not as easy as surface , you need to work with local residents .
to grow fast trees , and at the same time ,
We grow _UNK_ plants , which are very popular _UNK_ .
And the same thing is that they can get proper _UNK_
These _UNK_ can be attached to the growth of _UNK_ , falling from 24 hours .
and the root of the tree is brought back .
If you get these microbes , you don &apos;t have any results .
And then we &apos;re going to start _UNK_ -- a thousand trees a day .
In fact we can grow more , but we don &apos;t think about it .
because we want to stay in a stable employment number .
We use _UNK_ to look at the soil type ,
Look at what plants or what trees grow .
We have monitor every tree in this area .
In 100 meters , the _UNK_ is the palm of sugar .
If you look at the trees of our trees , like Europe ,
How much do you know from Russia to England ?
In this case , we should plant 10 times more trees .
You have to know what you &apos;re doing ,
A _UNK_ that grows vegetables and trees , or _UNK_ trees ,
and then make sure that every stage in the forest
At first , it may be _UNK_ , apple , and corn first .
In the second phase , there will be banana and _UNK_ .
from fruits , from the wood , from the _UNK_ , creating output ,
You see some _UNK_ -- these are actually _UNK_ trees .
In these regions we began to grow more and more
If you look at the _UNK_ Tower ,
with bananas , _UNK_ , and all the local residents ,
But the trees are also growing rapidly between them .
So , three years later , we have _UNK_ birds .
We reduced the temperature of three to five degrees of temperature .
And the cloud -- I &apos;ll show you the picture .
This is a radio receiver that we work with European Space Administration .
It gives us the interests of every _UNK_ satellite system ,
We use these pictures of carbon _UNK_ and forest growth ,
We can monitor every tree through the satellite ,
to provide other areas of our work and the same technology .
If you want to use a little new technology , tracking systems
You can directly tell which _UNK_ is sustainable ,
But you measure it , and this is the diversity of life .
_UNK_ diversity is an indicator for measuring water balance ,
And finally , I &apos;m going to build it into a _UNK_ .
because now the forest can begin to build rain .
There is a serious water resource in this city ,
And now we get a lot of water into the _UNK_ .
Now , we &apos;re going to look at the cloud in this forest ,
What we see is built in _UNK_ , half _UNK_ , and _UNK_ .
In the _UNK_ , the rain is not formed by ice ,
You need chemical components to produce from the leaves .
So if you create a _UNK_ area of clouds ,
you &apos;ll have a forest that can produce rainfall .
Now , you see , there &apos;s a cloud of cloud
If you look at the rainfall , it &apos;s over _UNK_ .
You can see that this trend will continue .
At first we have a little higher rainfall
In the _UNK_ , here was the most _UNK_ place ,
But now you can see that there &apos;s a peak of rainfall .
And of course , if there is a _UNK_ , the rainfall is going to disappear ,
You see the rainfall _UNK_ come back to this area .
So , don &apos;t talk about what this means ,
Technology is a great thing , but it &apos;s still depends on people ,
But what &apos;s really successful is that our band
Because if we were born , we would show that every person was our family ,
to bring people to power and water .
We also set up a _UNK_ for this _UNK_ .
_UNK_ the chimpanzees and humans -- we &apos;re in this area ,
As a gene bank , it makes all the material _UNK_ ,
Did there be a tropical _UNK_ tree grown up ?
So , we &apos;re going to do this inside now .
Every family they sell is now _UNK_ a land .
And it has two good tropical _UNK_ as a fence ,
You can grow a _UNK_ forest in the first year ,
After a few years , you can move away from these _UNK_ forests ,
that people get the _UNK_ that can be saved ,
It can be used to cover the house and serve the _UNK_ .
And then they can start to grow from trees .
But no matter what you &apos;re doing in this project , you have to be fully supported by local people ,
In other words , you have to adjust to culture value ,
There is no single formula in all different ways .
You have to make sure that corruption is hard to happen ,
We divided the _UNK_ into a group of 20 families .
Other _UNK_ members must decide how to deal with him .
So , other 33 groups have to decide how to deal with this .
The group not to abide by the _UNK_ of the agreement .
So you can use local judicial system to protect your system .
So , in a sense , people can sell their land within a year
to get revenue , but they find jobs , build and _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ with chimpanzees , they can use the waste of wood .
They can get free land in the woods ,
Now they can sell part of the fruit of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So we can produce a lot of ethanol and energy in local production .
And all the things that are going to depend on
So if we want to help chimpanzees --
We must make sure that the local people are _UNK_ .
Now I think it &apos;s going to be done , really , very simple ,
I hope -- if you want to know more , you can read more knowledge .
I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not going to mention this afternoon .
And I did some of the talks at the beginning .
&quot; The city is not a problem , but it &apos;s a solution . &quot;
and the way to deal with climate change
But we have a very _UNK_ attitude to the city .
Everybody in the city tried to tell me , oh , his city was too big .
Or another mayor would say that we don &apos;t have financial sources .
From my experience , every city in the world
It &apos;s not important , and it &apos;s not about scale .
every problem in the city has to form it for many reasons .
I want to start with some of these pictures
And the best example of life is _UNK_ .
because _UNK_ is an example of the work and life together .
And when you look at the shell ,
We can imagine that if we take the shell out of the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ is sad .
and most people are ready to leave the cities
He was invited to a party and he didn &apos;t want to leave .
and put it on the table , and then you drink it .
And then on the other side , like _UNK_ , friendly bus .
talking about planning , every city has its own plan .
_UNK_ , my city , the city of _UNK_ ,
But in order to make it happen , sometimes you have to ask a plan
This is the structure of the city of _UNK_ .
This is a sample of work and living together .
The traffic system started building in _UNK_ , and we plan to carry about 700 passengers every day .
It took 25 years to know the other cities
is _UNK_ , and what they did is they did .
Now , there are _UNK_ cities in the world
They call the fast transportation system that they call
And one thing is that this is important , not just for your city ,
_UNK_ and _UNK_ are becoming a very important factor
If you come to _UNK_ , you can get a coffee in my house
It allows the bus to work like the subway .
And you can buy a ticket in a _UNK_ .
And for _UNK_ , they can use this _UNK_
The main source of carbon emissions is that cars
50 percent of that . So when we only depend on our car
is the idea of city , the design of urban cities
And this is a very important way to teach children
We started in _UNK_ and we plan to Rio
And then , after _UNK_ , they called us to develop -- our plans are moving
You can understand how many different things are going to be .
In the day , she was not _UNK_ , only in the evening ,
And before you say that this is a _UNK_ design ,
how she works . So this is the same system .
what I &apos;m trying to say . I &apos;m not trying to figure out
Never -- if there &apos;s a subway in the city , if there &apos;s land transport ,
And I went back to the car , and I went to the house ,
When the only woman in your life is your wife ,
So all the ideas that are designed to improve --
the _UNK_ , the open university , and the _UNK_ garden .
all of these things that we teach our children
If children learn how to _UNK_ garbage in six months ,
In the last 20 years , the world &apos;s _UNK_ rate
I want to say that if we want to have a sustainable world
I worked at the museum and worked in a _UNK_ city
because you &apos;re not going to stay 18 hours a day ,
that can play different characters in 24 hours .
Another question is that cities are like our families
Even if we don &apos;t like the nose of the uncle ,
And all the cities can be able to get a photograph
We &apos;re built in 72 hours . Yes , you have to go fast .
These are the _UNK_ of different national construction .
A park , a _UNK_ park , Japanese Square , German style park .
And all of a sudden , the Soviet Union
Don &apos;t forget : creativity comes out of the budget ,
This is the opera house , and we &apos;re in two months
the park -- it was built by the old mine .
So , in the city , you have to move faster
I mean , with some focus problems to help _UNK_ work .
or the minimum New York City , but the most beautiful park :
You can always develop new materials , new sustainable materials
But remember , we must move quickly into action .
In the end , because we don &apos;t have so much time to plan
In addition , we don &apos;t have the advantages of all answers .
And it &apos;s very important for people to contribute
Finally , I hope you can help me sing the sustainable _UNK_ .
You &apos;re going to play a _UNK_ and play a melody .
? That &apos;s possible ! It &apos;s possible ! You can do it ! Can you do it !
? It &apos;s a little bit less driving ! Don &apos;t you decide ?
? Avoid carbon emissions ! This is possible ! This is possible !
? You can do that ! Can you do that !
? It &apos;s more near home ! Is home saving energy ?
? That &apos;s possible ! This is possible ! You can do it !
? You can do that ! _UNK_ your rubbish ! ?
? organic , or organic ! _UNK_ ! _UNK_ ! _UNK_ ! Is that possible ?
? You can do it ! _UNK_ ! Now -- do you ?
I want to talk about the hand of the box ,
The _UNK_ put them on the shelf , and they should now be _UNK_ .
and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to put them on the Internet .
Can you put your web on the Internet ? &quot; I said , &quot; Of course . &quot;
As I said , it &apos;s been _UNK_ by _UNK_
So I _UNK_ it over 20 or more numbers ,
you know how many people have seen it .
So , this is a great preparation today ,
is that it &apos;s going to work for you .
And I talked about him four years ago ,
I mean , the serious climate crisis is really , obviously .
I think if you don &apos;t believe it , you should think about it .
We had to deal with it , and we had to deal with it .
But you might say , &quot; Look , I &apos;m very good .
But this is a crisis , it &apos;s not about natural resources ,
as many speakers say in the last few days ,
not to feel what their talent is ,
In fact , I &apos;m probably divided the world into two groups .
He said , &quot; There are two people in the world ,
They don &apos;t feel very happy from their work .
If you say to them , &quot; Don &apos;t do that . &quot; They can &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
because it &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing . They said ,
And if I give it to me , it &apos;s silly because
you have to create the environment that they show .
This word has been _UNK_ in the last few days --
It &apos;s not easy to do things in most cases .
&quot; It &apos;s not going to be done in other ways , because they &apos;re using it . &quot;
I suddenly remembered the classic sentence of _UNK_ ,
I think he must be glad to use this sentence .
I explained what happened at the time , I didn &apos;t know .
We suppress it , you know , this is our policy .
Because , _UNK_ , an attractive thing happened in December ,
And all of us are _UNK_ to these ideas ,
like the natural thing , that &apos;s what it looks like .
It has been made , they are not _UNK_ with the objective environment of this century .
just to deal with the objective environment in the last century .
We had to come out of some of them .
It &apos;s hard to know what you think is for granted .
And why do you think it &apos;s for granted .
Let me ask you some questions , and you might think it &apos;s for granted .
How many of you here are 25 years old ?
This is not what I think you are for granted .
Is it less than 25 years old ?
If you take a piece of _UNK_ your hand .
Is it useful for us , isn &apos;t it ?
And the same question is that _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I &apos;m not saying they can &apos;t do it or they don &apos;t ,
And the reason is , you see , we &apos;re over 25 years old ,
is a great _UNK_ in the culture of the digital era ,
Because for us , if you want to know time ,
The children are living in the digital times ,
And by the way , you don &apos;t have to need it .
Just because you &apos;re accustomed to it , you &apos;ll continue to do it .
My daughter never took a watch , my daughter _UNK_ ( _UNK_ 20 ) .
I said , &quot; _UNK_ , it &apos;s also showing time . &quot;
But you see , this is what we &apos;re trained to fight .
From here , you move on a orbit ,
If you do anything to do , you get to the point
every person at TED , _UNK_ to us ,
and to help us create the relationship of self .
I think we &apos;re going to get people to college ,
I &apos;m not saying you shouldn &apos;t go to college , but not everyone needs to go to college ,
I was in _UNK_ , in _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
One of them bought my book about 30 years old .
And I said , &quot; How long are you going to be a _UNK_ ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Great . &quot; He said , &quot; Well , I met the problem in the middle of the school ,
because everyone in the school wanted to be a _UNK_ . &quot;
He said , &quot; I want to be a _UNK_ . &quot;
And he said , &quot; When I was a high grade ,
I was _UNK_ my youth in the _UNK_ .
I should go to university and become a professional _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to waste my talent of it . &quot;
The teacher said _UNK_ in front of the class , and I was so awful .
But that &apos;s what I want to do , after school ,
I immediately applied the fire work and was admitted . &quot;
He said , &quot; You know , before you ask me a few seconds ago ,
And I suddenly thought of the teacher . &quot;
He said , &quot; I think he &apos;s better than my ideas . &quot;
If I have time , I &apos;ll be here in detail , but I &apos;m not .
&quot; You know , one - three - year - old is not half the age of six . &quot;
like the one that we heard at the top ,
It was a big competition in the _UNK_ ,
At the age of 3 , the interview is beginning .
&quot; You &apos;ve been in 36 months , and these are these ? &quot;
_UNK_ feed six months , and this is what I can see . &quot;
Look , this idea is impossible to tolerate , but it _UNK_ us .
_UNK_ Oliver ( _UNK_ ) used to mention the problem .
You know the high quality guaranteed that there are two types of shapes .
The second is a restaurant like _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
We transferred ourselves and build a fast food model .
like fast food is running out of our physical resources .
I think we have to recognize some things here .
It &apos;s probably Eric _UNK_ got his first guitar .
You know , Eric &apos;s success , I just want to say that .
whether it &apos;s often or how hard it is .
Usually , people are good to do what they don &apos;t really care about .
If you &apos;re doing what you love , you know , you &apos;re good at doing these things ,
You know , if you &apos;re doing what you love ,
If you &apos;re doing something that doesn &apos;t work with you ,
And a lot of people _UNK_ from education
And we had to go from _UNK_ ,
And you can &apos;t expect the outcome of human development ;
So , when we look at the form of _UNK_ and change education ,
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ , a very good system .
At the same time , it was supported by individual conditions .
I encourage you to participate in this ,
But we have to _UNK_ from the industrial model ,
Or at home , if they were friends with his family ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ , in my mind , in my mind ,
I want to read a quick short poetry ,
From _UNK_ , he was a person you might know .
He couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted .
He said , &quot; I have something else , but it &apos;s not for you . &quot;
In spite of the circumstances , I &apos;m going to solve the problem .
And the problem that we &apos;re dealing with is big ,
And this is just what I learned from Georgia
At the same time , these businesses are the only ones
And then I asked a challenge to my employees .
I want to lead our companies and the whole industry to sustainable development .
can cycle the Earth &apos;s resources in the natural world ,
One day , like me , is going to be locked in a cell
And the interview was the cover of &quot; The _UNK_ . &quot;
And then they said I was the most green CEO
They asked me , &quot; What is the meaning of a cell
and the wealth of the _UNK_ will be a crime .
But I realized that there was a lot of
to make the wealth of theft into a crime .
because this is the _UNK_ of our offspring .
and the industry will turn it into products , and these products will soon become waste .
In a simple way , use Paul and Anne ,
But you may calculate the number of people and wealth
but it &apos;s always hard to _UNK_ the technology .
but it &apos;s still going to help us understand problems .
In the past , we &apos;ve got a lot of oil and energy
I hope that the interface company can _UNK_ the formula :
T is going to influence -- that &apos;s bad .
And I think it &apos;s going to be a general idea
And T has to be put in the _UNK_
In the new technological Revolution , it must be replaced with _UNK_ .
I think that if we can make these changes ,
So I can tell you what we did in the beginning of 12 years
It &apos;s two thirds of sales , and the profits are _UNK_ .
because you can replace the use of energy
And we found that the most cheap oil is ,
_UNK_ or _UNK_ materials are 25 percent , and are growing rapidly .
And that &apos;s when we first started to do that ,
has been produced and sold since 2004 .
from the _UNK_ to the whole process of recycling .
Three years ago , we launched the home _UNK_
and you can make it available in five days .
I think we &apos;re going to go through half of the journey
We &apos;re going to go to the zero _UNK_
We want to go to the top of the sustainable development .
We found that &quot; zero mission &quot; is a great urge for business development .
It came from my own experience that we actually saw the cost of falling , not rising .
We have about 30 million dollars to save .
It costs us to pay the cost of our company
that the economy and the environment are not _UNK_ .
Our employees are also _UNK_ for this higher ideal ,
And there &apos;s no better _UNK_ than this . It &apos;s good people .
This is the sales and the _UNK_ of our 14 years .
from 2001 to 2003 and 2003 had fallen .
And in that time , our sales volume is
If we replace the capital A for _UNK_ ?
And so , it means that wealth is just one of the ways to reach .
Even if it &apos;s not for humans , it &apos;s at least for the species
and it &apos;s going to come back in the next generation ,
But the Earth is not just the destruction of human beings ?
And we really want to be able to
like my good friends , good _UNK_ , said ,
If we can do it , it &apos;s probably possible .
If we had this serious dependence on oil , anybody could do it .
If anyone can do it , no one can do it .
There are people who have been in danger
Let me tell you who is most dangerous .
I met this man in the early days of climbing this mountain .
I walked in the crowd , and I used to do that .
I &apos;ll tell them that I didn &apos;t know myself was creating new contacts .
And that &apos;s what he did next Tuesday
I read that poem , and I felt that I had a life of joy
And that poem tells me that someone had experienced it ,
And this is the content that _UNK_ wrote .
&quot; There is no name , no face , no face , no idea where birth is coming from ?
I see you can see one day , that &apos;s in your body , not me .
I &apos;m going to start thinking about you , and you have a good life .
I &apos;m always thinking , what I waste , what I lost ,
is part of the human race , even _UNK_ , and part of the life network .
I would wear my iPod , and I would wear it ,
from _UNK_ to Stephen _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s the judge -- the character is , it &apos;s true ,
But I don &apos;t believe you &apos;re all in the same core ,
a lot of people who work in this field
We now realize that the Internet is going to be
or an artist , and try to attract
Technology is the biggest _UNK_ of our time .
We believe that we can always get what we want ,
We can go shopping at three or three nights in the morning ,
to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ and park --
And when we let it take a hundred dollars
when the culture is used to use the Internet
People in the field are faced with a lot of difficult problems .
We have an art , through the old coalition ,
and put us into business models that are dependent on high _UNK_ ,
Many of us were _UNK_ after the &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot;
for those of you who love the art ,
Have you asked me to light my life and feel happy ?
Now , we are in the edge of the collapse ,
I prefer to believe that we &apos;re going to do this ,
And in fact , it was the press press .
in order to make us a _UNK_ ?
He was the author of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ theory ,
For me , he was really the first person to focus on it .
and the first time it became a _UNK_ .
In the _UNK_ , if anyone in your _UNK_ film ,
You need to work for _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
And now , this room doesn &apos;t know a 14 year-old kid
but try to make her the second , third or fourth film ?
The first time in human history became _UNK_ .
Again , in _UNK_ , _UNK_ Brothers or _UNK_ have done this art for you .
We are far away from the period of the number of people .
And the idea of the _UNK_ of words
as a religious reform and not end up .
the best way to protect the economy ,
that artists who need to have a scale of resources
It &apos;s not about the music show or the stage ,
the global warming problem or the _UNK_ help ,
He or she was called up to work .
is defined by the royal _UNK_ or Canada ,
The age of the dancer from 18 to _UNK_ ,
and not by _UNK_ and _UNK_ to define ,
but by the _UNK_ Theater in Los Angeles ,
And today &apos;s _UNK_ and _UNK_ are working with young _UNK_ .
than it is in the edge of a time ,
We are important to the health of the community in town .
I want you to know that every time you &apos;re playing the art ticket ,
for five to seven dollars in the economy ,
We bought the fabric of the cloth for the show .
We hired the piano _UNK_ and so on .
But as we move forward , the art will be
like they used to be on the iPod .
We have to use and _UNK_ the power of art
They are often _UNK_ by the impact of human beings ,
At each station , every bus station , every airport can hear ,
whatever it is , when the art _UNK_ us together ,
Art allows us to use _UNK_ and curious
And I was paying tribute to all the people who worked for this goal ,
and strong hope you _UNK_ and _UNK_ your art ,
I promise you that from now to the future
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Thank you very much for your kindness and patience to listen to me this afternoon .
And we are really honored to be able to come to _UNK_ ,
What you &apos;ve just heard is the _UNK_ of life .
He thought that music should come from inside .
And that was in the 20th century ,
is not the most _UNK_ in the classical music world .
It &apos;s nice to meet you , and I &apos;ll be here .
I &apos;m very clear that I &apos;m responsible for all of you
because I &apos;m the only obstacles to you and the bar .
but I &apos;m not going to have a long talk
I have some ability to describe my life , and how I make a living picture .
People can forget the text for a long time , remember the contents of the picture .
So I want you to remember some of these images
I &apos;m going to share with you , just a few minutes .
I was a high school student in Pennsylvania ,
living in a very _UNK_ , everyone left the hope block .
I walked down the aisle of the school ,
And the artist was listening to his own mind ,
I stumbled on the _UNK_ of the art classroom
If you &apos;ve ever seen how _UNK_ works , it &apos;s just magic .
I &apos;ve never seen anything in my life .
So I went to the art classroom and said , &quot; What is this ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a _UNK_ . I think you can do this . &quot;
He said , &quot; Okay , let your director sign a list ,
that you can come here and I &apos;ll teach you . &quot;
And so , I was at the end of the school ,
I sent my teacher to my pottery for the course .
And I did the school in the middle .
&quot; You &apos;ve got this _UNK_ , and I &apos;m not _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to leave the school and take you away . &quot;
And then he drove me to the University of _UNK_
I had a _UNK_ for that , and I was allowed to read it .
Don &apos;t give up those poor kids because you never know
what &apos;s going to happen in their life . &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you a couple of minutes
I was in the middle of the _UNK_ crime
_UNK_ training centers , this is a mom and welfare mother .
in the middle of the school in _UNK_ .
Do you remember the production of steel before _UNK_ ?
people who used to live in a _UNK_
I _UNK_ them and give them a new life .
The _UNK_ of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And he went to a deserted residential building where ,
I soon knew that if there were _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Last year I spoke to him in the funeral ,
I got a student at the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Let him build a _UNK_ Center for me ,
My center is almost the ratio of the _UNK_ airport .
When you come to _UNK_ … always welcome you …
you &apos;re going to _UNK_ my _UNK_ version of the building .
It was built in a rough block of poverty .
And I think that if you want to take those steps
has been considered that there is no hope of life ,
You should look more like a solution to solving problems instead of problems .
You see , there &apos;s a fountain in the yard .
It was my idea to do a fountain in _UNK_ .
I took a check and bought a place .
Now I &apos;m talking to a conference like TED ,
They allowed me to join the board of _UNK_ museum
I saw a fountain with a _UNK_ in the museum .
because they think it should be a fountain for everyone to the museum .
Well , I think it should be welfare Mom , unfortunately children
and in the life of the unemployed , there is a fountain fountain .
So what you see in the middle of my spring ,
is to meet your water -- water is the source of life .
and their attitudes and expectations about them .
And as you see , it has the _UNK_ _UNK_ , and it &apos;s all in my taste .
I said to my son , &quot; If you &apos;ve got enough money
And I think it &apos;s only the world like this ,
I hired a furniture _UNK_ from Kyoto in Japan ,
Let him make 60 furniture for our building .
because we , he has come up with his own career .
He is now custom furniture , _UNK_ a lot of money .
His custom furniture is 60 for my school _UNK_ .
because I think the welfare and the unemployed
and a single mom would be willing to go
Some manual furniture is welcome their school every day .
because it &apos;s a very early time you &apos;ve shown them
We even had the flowers in the corridor , not for plastic .
But they &apos;re in the market every day in our _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a team of high school teachers ,
Your story is so wonderful that your school is great .
We &apos;re curious about how the flowers are there ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I open my car , I went to the _UNK_ ,
to buy these flowers , and they bring them back and put them there . &quot;
You don &apos;t need a task group or a research team to buy for your children .
What you need to know is that kids
The cost of buying is _UNK_ , but what it means is huge .
in my school , full of sunshine and flowers ,
So what you &apos;re going to see is a _UNK_ kitchen
It &apos;s supplied by _UNK_ and you &apos;ve heard of the company ?
I was just as familiar with the company ,
because the _UNK_ , John _UNK_ , who was _UNK_ ,
And then he died of the plane crash --
I heard that I was going to build this wish ,
because I &apos;m holding a cardboard box in the garbage
And what is going to happen to the _UNK_ .
And it feels like I &apos;m going to go to &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
John _UNK_ has six dollars , and I &apos;m only 60 cents .
and what you do for children and unemployment workers ,
We &apos;d like to help you build the wish of the new building .
And then you give us some help . &quot;
Because at that time , we &apos;re just going to do _UNK_ training .
And he said , &quot; Well , we &apos;ll do that .
I said , &quot; Mr. _UNK_ , let me go into the realm of _UNK_ ,
It makes me feel a little _UNK_ , but I promise you ,
And if you take my school , you know ,
And I &apos;m going to take it back a couple of years ,
And the big _UNK_ sat there and said ,
How do you respond to your response ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Mr. Senate , we seem to have a march of cooking training . &quot;
and John really gave me a million dollars .
He also _UNK_ the minister of his company to me .
We took a little bit of American cooking school ,
And that school is as good as Harvard .
So we designed a food cooking course for welfare _UNK_ ,
is in the kitchen in the middle of the city .
I want to show you some of the food
They are made of these benefits in the kitchen of this million dollars .
But my idea is that I have to _UNK_ the _UNK_ in food .
Every man should enjoy it , no reason for anyone to _UNK_ .
So , in my school , we had a wonderful lunch plan ,
These are plans to live in the middle of the city ,
because we found that this helps their stomach .
because I want them to understand where I call the center ,
They are worth every day in their lives .
We have black students , white students , and they sat together .
We find that race problems can be solved ,
because people are willing to show the _UNK_ behavior
This is a picture of a welfare _UNK_ .
And the only question that the poor is that
They don &apos;t have a penny , and the problem can be solved .
It depends on how you look at people
This picture was made by a student who was training seven months .
I &apos;ve eaten seven of these food _UNK_ and it &apos;s nice .
And I think the students should have this respect ,
like _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ technology and _UNK_ oil .
I promise you , if you come to my _UNK_ center ,
We found that you had to give them flowers ,
the sun , the food , the expectation , the music of _UNK_
so that every time you can heal the cancer .
We are trained for the tourism training director .
The child in the _UNK_ has been trained two years ago .
Some children have high school _UNK_ , but they don &apos;t know the word of the certificate .
and how it might have this kind of thing .
It is not the number of people who are graduate .
so that the children are normal , 20 percent of the time
you can get a high school level in my school .
This is my art course in _UNK_ in 1968 .
Remember , I am a black _UNK_ in the &apos; 60s , making my life save .
When I &apos;m going to _UNK_ my growth model ,
And my theory is that if you give them
There were 400 children who had been in _UNK_
Every day I &apos;m here to be an art education .
These children are soon left by the state schools .
Last year I let the kids go into college ,
This ratio is about 15 years above the average .
In this case , I won a big and old _UNK_ - the - year education figure .
because I think if you treat kids like people ,
They would be more likely to be a _UNK_ .
in every school , every city , every town and every town ?
And these kids don &apos;t have art cells , no talent ,
Without imagination , we hired a lot of _UNK_ artists
The children can become the same person as teaching them .
In fact , I took a _UNK_ artist from _UNK_ ,
Let me show you the work of their work .
And these kids were _UNK_ by the world
Just have love , sunshine , food , good music and confidence .
This is the work of some of the students
because we believe that poor children need a _UNK_ gallery .
I even came up with a way to get their parents to the opening ceremony .
So I was a _UNK_ , and he moved from God &apos;s career .
I said , &quot; Bill , I want to hire you ,
You &apos;ve got to put a thing in God ,
I can &apos;t get these parents to school . &quot;
He said , &quot; I &apos;ll let them come to school . &quot;
And then he _UNK_ and went to Mrs. Jones and asked ,
&quot; Jones , I know you &apos;re going to go to your children &apos;s opening ceremony ,
He _UNK_ ten parents first and then came to 20 parents .
There was 200 parents in our exhibition on our show .
Because now , if you don &apos;t come to the exhibition of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
you &apos;re not going to be accepted by society ,
Mother went to the celebration of his children .
I want you to look at the gallery because it &apos;s not better than it is .
to these kids , when I graduated from here ,
They have a four exhibition experience on their resume .
before you can change the behavior of people
It &apos;s a very effective rule that it has been done today .
I &apos;d like to show you a room on the floor .
We did this slide before the TED conference .
I did a little slide in Silicon Valley ,
And what &apos;s wrong is that your computer is _UNK_ . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; I &apos;m working in the _UNK_ . &quot;
I said , &quot; Are you in the computer industry , right ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; There &apos;s a very simple way to solve it . &quot;
I &apos;m glad to announce you , _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
We &apos;ve been the technology and furniture as they all have .
in the _UNK_ of the entire beauty show .
And we &apos;ve just done it to show you
This speech became a global _UNK_ of our digital image center .
and the story started getting more and more interesting .
So I want you to listen to me a few minutes ,
And you know why he &apos;s there , I &apos;m here .
In 1986 , I was building this center ,
I &apos;d like to fix a concert hall on the side of it .
And then a guy named _UNK_ came up here ,
because he knew the people sitting there -- _UNK_ .
And one afternoon at Wednesday , one o &apos;clock ,
&quot; Why are you going to show a black center ?
Here is a industrial park , the crime is high ,
He said , &quot; Because I heard you built this center ,
But I don &apos;t believe you make it , so I want to look at myself .
Now I believe , and I &apos;ll send you a gift . &quot;
I allow you to recorded the scene for me .
If you &apos;re ready to take these _UNK_ , you have to sign a agreement ,
The _UNK_ must be used to finance the school . &quot;
I _UNK_ for _UNK_ , and after half a year he died .
But before he died , he told us what we did ,
&quot; _UNK_ talked to you all over the country ,
And then , a guy called the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
They all come to a central performance in the central _UNK_ .
The audience is filled with a _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
I &apos;m happy to tell you that under these artists ,
He recorded his last album in my school .
_UNK_ found me and put his hand on my shoulder .
and said , &quot; It &apos;s God who &apos;s chosen you to do this job ,
I &apos;d like my music to be with you . &quot;
And the band came up with excitement in school ,
They voted to give me the rights of the show .
I made them recorded music , and we won a thing called _UNK_ .
I was such a fool that I didn &apos;t attend the ceremony ,
because I don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to win .
Our name is _UNK_ over the _UNK_ garden .
And then _UNK_ went to us and we recorded music for them .
The second time you get the _UNK_ nomination .
And so we became one of the United States
In this crime , there is a high center of the crime .
And if you were there a bomb there ,
So all of the _UNK_ are broken by you ,
And my parents were there , and they lived enough
It was _UNK_ , like I told you that he was there .
It was our first _UNK_ , and it used to be a _UNK_ .
We can only put all the _UNK_ in the corridor , _UNK_ the room ,
This is our new _UNK_ , all the video technology .
And this room is what we did for Nancy _UNK_ ,
Last Christmas , she recorded a album in our school .
If any of you look at the Christmas Show ,
you &apos;ll see him and Nancy are on the show .
She _UNK_ the album rights to our school .
I &apos;m going to give you my promise ,
Once in &quot; _UNK_ &quot; , his CD will sell 10,000 copies .
We are now in the fourth place in the United States ,
This picture is a building in riot - close to my school .
and then I went to the streets again .
I &apos;m glad to tell you that this _UNK_ has been _UNK_ .
It &apos;s all famous in this building , a 20 feet ,
is three times the rent price in the city .
The _UNK_ Center is the big _UNK_ here ,
We are now trained by their systems to train medical skills .
I love them because they pay the rent on time .
I &apos;m now the director of the financial company ,
And this is the kind of thing that we &apos;re building
The _UNK_ in the photograph expanded four times the October year .
In the middle of the city the butterfly was _UNK_ .
We &apos;re working with a big retail agreement ,
Let them sell our _UNK_ in six states .
Our partner is a _UNK_ company in Spain .
So , the Hispanic and black people came together .
In the middle of the city , _UNK_ has high - tech content .
to find some of the funds for the world ,
we can go to the left side of the Wall Street Journal .
So we finally got some financial aid , our greenhouse will open this autumn .
You must see at the time -- this is the _UNK_ of the story .
This is a picture that I want to do ,
Now , that brown building you see it ,
I told you that I made a big mistake in it .
I had the opportunity to take the whole site
-- it &apos;s less than 1,000 feet away from the river --
I didn &apos;t buy it at the price of $ _UNK_ .
Do you know what happened after I repaired the first floor ?
I let the increase in this block is beyond all human imagination ,
Last year I offered _UNK_ dollars to buy the whole site , the owners of the park refused .
You should get the annual leader of the year ,
And the story tells people that people are ready for their dreams ,
I did a slide on a big economic summit a few years ago ,
And one of the people in the audience found me ,
And I said , &quot; Well , what are you doing ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I run a city called San Francisco .
I took his praise of the _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ was going to play at the center of the night .
He came to the center , and he said , &quot; What is this ? &quot;
I said , &quot; _UNK_ , the _UNK_ Center for the poor .
I &apos;d like to build a training center for 25 years , now you &apos;ve achieved it .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s it . Where are you going to fix it ? &quot;
In fact , he did know the _UNK_ Brown .
_UNK_ Brown , _UNK_ and I had dinner for four years ago ,
We begin to paint the blueprint on the table .
_UNK_ Brown said , &quot; I &apos;m going to guarantee the name of the mayor ,
to give us the poor people in this city . &quot;
He _UNK_ me to five acres near the _UNK_ ,
We &apos;ve got help from someone else , like a designer , a contractor ,
a friend of _UNK_ , a friend of _UNK_ ,
a friend of _UNK_ , a rich country bank
in the Silicon Valley , in the middle of California ,
I said , &quot; Thank you very much for helping us ,
He said , &quot; I started a company called _UNK_ . &quot;
Thank you very much . Please give me your card , we can talk about the future . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the company at the time .
But the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
I asked some of the students in the school ,
I said , &quot; I &apos;ve seen the boss of this company ,
I called him up and said , &quot; Mr. _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
And I went to the school community , which was called _UNK_ Point ,
I said , &quot; The mayor sent me to work with you ,
I want to work with you on the training center ,
But if you don &apos;t want it , we don &apos;t want to go .
The only thing I &apos;m going to convince you is a box of slides . &quot;
So , in a _UNK_ , I stood in front of 200 very angry people ,
The air conditioning in the house is broken ,
After 10 photos , they were all _UNK_ down ,
I told my story to them , and finally said , &quot; What do you think ? &quot;
In the back of the room , a woman stood up and said ,
&quot; I lived in this place where God was _UNK_ for 35 years ,
You &apos;re the only person who looks at us .
She influenced all the audience at the time .
I promise these people , not only do we fix it ,
I think we &apos;re going to start building this year .
The school will be built in the _UNK_ Center for _UNK_ .
And then I went through the _UNK_ Jones ,
_UNK_ said , &quot; I want to help you ,
as if I fell in love with his music ,
_UNK_ said , &quot; What is the idea of building a training center ? &quot;
I said , &quot; This is from your music .
when I was 16 years old in the production of _UNK_ ,
And when the world is still dark ,
And I said , &quot; With those music ,
I _UNK_ the sun , and I &apos;ll be good .
If it &apos;s not that , how do I get the current achievements ? &quot;
I think the world is worth our lives .
to a city again , people stand in the corner ,
There is no soul in the eyes of empty eye .
How can we be a country without _UNK_ this situation ?
In Pennsylvania , the people who look like me
But the _UNK_ university took about _UNK_ million dollars .
It costs less than 20 dollars to build a medical school .
and the good people who have some faith in it .
I wish to do this in every city , every small town , and to pay for life .
I think we can bring these things back home ,
I think we can go all over the country
And I believe that we can make life miserable
a kind of depression in the middle of the world .
I finally found a way to avoid depression ,
That &apos;s a friend of every town that you will never feel lonely .
I hope I can take some friends here tonight .
And thank you for the story that I &apos;ve heard .
The bacteria are the oldest living creatures on the planet .
They are characterized by only one cell .
and genetic information to code the characteristics of their expression .
And after the growth of two times , they &apos;re both _UNK_ .
_UNK_ into two cells , and so on .
They don &apos;t stop growth , split , then _UNK_ , _UNK_ -- are kind of _UNK_ life .
But today I want to tell you
I know you think you &apos;re human , and that &apos;s probably what I &apos;m looking at .
And all the circles in him represent the cells of all human beings .
Every human body is made up of individual _UNK_ .
They allow us to do all kinds of things we want to do .
There are about _UNK_ million bacteria living in your body .
This is all A , T , G and C
to make your gene code , give you all the glamorous features .
And the number of genes around your bacteria is 100 times more
They always play an important role in your body and surface .
I know you &apos;re a guy who &apos;s &quot; human , &quot;
But in my eyes you are 90 percent of the bacteria .
to help us , to maintain our lives .
but because they do a lot at the same time .
There are hundreds of bacteria on the planet
And they don &apos;t have to be in your body at any time ,
But if you are unhappy , you must be ill .
So the question that we study is that you want to know
all the good or bacterial things that are good for them .
We once asked a question : What are they doing ?
and you can see it in a microscope .
Their life seems to be just _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
And it has been thought to be a _UNK_ life .
So in our view , they are really tiny ,
And so we &apos;re going to talk about this
And the answer to the question is that
What you see here is a work worker in my lab
holding a bottle of water that &apos;s filled with this bacteria ,
This is a bacteria from the oceans , beautiful and harmless bacteria :
And the characteristic of this bacteria is that it &apos;s going to light ,
We just closed the room and we took this picture ,
And we found that when bacteria were independent ,
When the _UNK_ is suspended , they are not _UNK_ .
But once they grow to a particular number ,
And so we thought , these primitive creatures ,
And we found that this was because they could talk to each other ,
Imagine that this is my bacteria . It &apos;s my own .
but they &apos;re going to make small chemical molecules
The red triangle represents these _UNK_ , when bacteria are _UNK_ ,
The _UNK_ is free , so it doesn &apos;t light .
And the contents of these cells are _UNK_
They would tell them how many neighbors around them ,
All bacteria , and at the same time it began to light .
The _UNK_ phenomenon of _UNK_ _UNK_ from biology .
Next , we &apos;ll see another marine creature :
What you see here is the _UNK_ of Hawaii ,
I want you to see that the two _UNK_ bumps ,
The _UNK_ is willing to accept them in the _UNK_ .
because this little _UNK_ live on the shores of Hawaii ,
But at night , they had to come out of it .
There &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ and _UNK_ nights ,
These light can be used in places where _UNK_ live .
because the seawater here is only deep .
that can open or close the bacteria into _UNK_ organs .
It can measure how many _UNK_ or _UNK_ are on its back ,
to make the light from its belly ,
with the strength of the light on the back of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s like the contact _UNK_ in the ocean .
But if you think about it , it &apos;s going to have a terrible problem .
Because in its body , these _UNK_ bacteria grow up , death ,
So every morning the sun rises in the sun ,
It _UNK_ itself to sleep in the sand ,
It has a _UNK_ with the night cycle ,
When the sun rises , it will be about 95 percent of the bacteria out of the body .
When bacteria are _UNK_ , these little hormones have disappeared ,
But _UNK_ was completely _UNK_ because it was sleeping in the sand .
And as the day , these bacteria continue to grow apart ,
They release enough of these _UNK_ , and then starting to light at night ,
We first learned why these bacteria would have this phenomenon ,
And then we use molecular biology in a way
And we found that this is my _UNK_ ,
is this red bar -- it &apos;s a catalyst ,
When the cell grows , they all release this molecule into the environment ,
So there &apos;s a lot of these molecules around the environment .
These bacteria have a receptor on the surface of the cell ,
It &apos;s the same as lock and keys are common .
They &apos;re like the receptor on the surface of my body .
And when these molecules add up to certain _UNK_ --
And that means that the number of cells increases
And this is interesting because in the last 10 years ,
And we found that this was the case ,
not only in this sea , weird , _UNK_ bacteria in the darkness ,
So we found that all bacteria were talking to each other .
Only when all cells work together to succeed in collective behavior .
We took a modern name for this behavior called _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , and all cells will be _UNK_ to the final vote .
We already know that there are hundreds of them
For everyone , the most concerned should be or the _UNK_ of bacteria .
It &apos;s not saying that a small amount of bacteria into your body
For them , you are a giant , small bacteria will not have any impact on you .
They &apos;re first entering your body , and wait , and start _UNK_ ,
And when you make sure that enough cells can count ,
and all the bacteria are starting to _UNK_ ,
so that they can actually overcome a great host .
And we also studied these kinds of _UNK_ ,
These are the little red _UNK_ that I just showed you .
And we started to study other bacteria ,
These are some of the things that we &apos;ve found
It &apos;s just a few different different ways of _UNK_ .
Each molecule can be combined with the relative _UNK_ , very _UNK_ .
every one of these bacteria represents its own language ,
We also began to understand what bacteria call social behavior .
But what we really think about is that
In most cases , bacteria are not alone , where they live together ,
They live in a place with hundreds of other bacteria .
This slide can be explained to this : this is your skin .
And this is a photograph of your skin .
It looks like it &apos;s going to be almost anywhere in your body .
I hope you can see that there are different bacteria here .
So we start thinking , if this is really a _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s not enough to communicate with _UNK_ bacteria ,
And they have a certain kind of _UNK_
with all other bacteria around the world .
But what we found is that we had
So they have another catalyst that can produce the second signal ,
This molecule is the public language of _UNK_ .
that the bacteria can be calculated by the way
and _UNK_ the number of bacteria around them .
They depend on the whole group of people
_UNK_ _UNK_ , the structure of this General molecule --
General molecules are the pink _UNK_ of my _UNK_ .
Each bacteria has a completely different catalyst ,
And once we understand this , we know it ,
We know that bacteria can communicate with each other .
But we &apos;re starting to think about it again ,
I &apos;ve told you that the bacteria are social behavior ,
And of course , I &apos;ve told you that
And of course , you must hear , and you know ,
And this is because of these antibiotics , it &apos;s killed bacteria .
is that it doesn &apos;t allow bacteria to replicate their DNA .
So , we have a world of _UNK_
We thought that if we could change these bacteria ,
just to talk about these bacteria , not counting ,
This is what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve done two different strategies :
We made some molecules that look like really molecular _UNK_ ,
You can see , they &apos;re just a little bit different .
And we can make it a little bit
We did the same thing for the pink system .
We use that General molecule to make some changes .
We hope that these molecules can be used to make broad antibiotics ,
In this case , we just use _UNK_ molecules ,
You know , when bacteria go into the animal ,
And it goes into the beginning of the _UNK_ ,
What we do is we do at the same time
to join our _UNK_ and _UNK_ molecules ,
which is what it looks like , &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot;
But as I pointed out in the _UNK_ , they have a little different .
And what we &apos;re looking at now is that
If you let the animals infected with multiple drugs ,
But at the same time , we call _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
We think this should be the next generation of antibiotic ,
It will allow us to , at least in the beginning ,
I want you to think that bacteria can talk to each other ,
So , like TED &apos;s spirit , they work together ,
because they have these collective behaviors , they have
And I want to talk to you further
that bacteria have lived on the planet for billions of years .
We will be able to get more cells in the body , and we have more understanding .
And if we could get them further out of these primitive organisms ,
to the rest of the human disease and behavior .
using these two molecules , they can express &quot; I &quot; and you . &quot;
Your heart and renal cells will not be together every day ,
This is because you have a whole bunch of chemicals in your body ,
These molecules can distinguish different cells from different cells ,
You &apos;re just evolved a few _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
But all of the concepts include the simple system we &apos;ve studied .
And finally , just _UNK_ , the actual application of this research ,
They are being developed as a new generation of therapy .
to encourage the survival of the Earth
So we &apos;ve locked these systems so that they can work better .
Remember that in your body , over 10 times your cells ,
And we &apos;re also trying to get more and more
You communicate between the bacteria you and your _UNK_ ,
to get bacteria to do what we want them to do .
Every discovery I tell you today is done by someone in the photo .
I just want to say , when you see something in the newspaper ,
or you hear something about nature , fun things ,
These are two , 30 years old young people
They are the engine that _UNK_ the country science .
I was getting older , but they were always changing ,
I &apos;m going to thank you for your invitation .
And it was a privilege to take this conference .
I want to tell you how we find these things .
When we started studying _UNK_ in six months ago ,
We don &apos;t know about the purpose of it .
It &apos;s Windows part , and it &apos;s very complicated ,
And after we did all kinds of different _UNK_ ,
And even though it &apos;s trying to get infected ,
because I don &apos;t think we don &apos;t know the goal .
So we &apos;d better find the goal as soon as possible .
and found that it had two numbers --
And we also found that they were known to all human beings
They even know the number of the operator &apos;s shoes .
If you &apos;ve ever heard , the _UNK_ of the virus
Here you can see a clip of the actual attack code .
I want to tell you that we are
The first thing we &apos;re looking for is the system function called ,
And then we &apos;re going to find _UNK_ and data structure ,
and try to relate them to the real world --
because most of the virus infections in Iran .
There &apos;s not a lot of goals in this area .
&quot; Give me a list of all _UNK_ and _UNK_ experts in our _UNK_ . &quot;
I was talking to them , and I let them go .
This rotor is the interior of the _UNK_ ,
If you control the speed of the rotor ,
is to make this _UNK_ slow --
They could not quickly find out what was going on .
the big number of numbers -- through a carefully ,
Imagine what we found in the attack code ?
It gave us more confidence in what we did .
Now don &apos;t _UNK_ me , it &apos;s not like this .
We often walk into a blind _UNK_
to take aim at the same goal ,
_UNK_ the rotor and let them slow down ,
We decided what the goal was to be .
some of the cool things that we see --
And it _UNK_ the _UNK_ from the sensor --
And in fact , this false input data
not only are the operator in the control room .
There is no place in which the human operator cannot make enough action .
And when the great steam turbine _UNK_ up ,
Obviously , the human operator is not possible to do it .
So , here we need a digital safety system .
The operator and the safety system will not notice .
I &apos;m going to talk about it , and it &apos;s very important .
As a _UNK_ , you don &apos;t need to --
as we see in this case of _UNK_ virus .
and you can spread it with traditional worms .
but in the United States , Europe and Japan .
_UNK_ : Okay , do you really want to know ?
Chris : Thank you for a big jump , thank you , _UNK_ .
And you look at the topic of medical care , about financial institutions ,
Some people say random _UNK_ , like the _UNK_ vote .
or the first thing that we can do
_UNK_ : Why do you think the best bamboo hand should be obtained ?
_UNK_ : The best _UNK_ have the best _UNK_ , we can hear the best music .
There &apos;s good music , and our lives are better .
But Peter , the reason that Aristotle is not so different
why the best bamboo is to give the best _UNK_ , Aristotle has another reason .
What we have to think is the fundamental nature of the problem .
one of the best _UNK_ to the best _UNK_ ,
The purpose of music play is not only to _UNK_ the audience , but to respect the excellent _UNK_ of musicians .
And of course , the _UNK_ may seem trivial .
How many of you think _UNK_ has the right to use _UNK_ ?
All right , we put our hands on , support _UNK_ .
All right , we put our hands on , support _UNK_ .
in the same way that you can raise your hands .
and it &apos;s going to be the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
Don &apos;t agree to _UNK_ . People who use the ball
If you raise your hand , we &apos;ll give you a microphone
And he can run around and it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ advantage .
OK , I think most of the people who don &apos;t agree to use golf cars ,
We give a microphone , and you can talk about
Tell us , why do you say he should be allowed to use _UNK_ ?
But from a _UNK_ to the other side of the game ?
&quot; It &apos;s no matter , it &apos;s not a part of the game . &quot;
Is it a part of the game on the field ?
The _UNK_ is a very important part of the game , including walking through the _UNK_ .
And they called the _UNK_ and the _UNK_
But the _UNK_ is an important part of the _UNK_ movement .
Oh , I &apos;ll just say the Supreme Court results .
The Supreme Court agreed to _UNK_ Martin &apos;s request that he could use golf cars .
He said he read all the history of golf sports
And the idea is that this movement is to take a very small ball out of a ball .
But the essence of sports is that it &apos;s _UNK_ .
First of all , no one who really likes to say that .
So , we don &apos;t care about the outcome of the game .
On the surface , this seems to be a debate about golf cars .
But if the threat is just a game , it &apos;s going to be a clear solution .
But if the threat is just a game , it &apos;s going to be a clear solution .
So if a golf ball becomes a side drive ,
You are one of the _UNK_ of open education , your series are the biggest projects in this field .
What are your expected to expect in the next phase ?
And I think we can make a lot more open debate
and then working with Chinese , India , Africa , and education institutions
Can you begin with people from China and India ?
Can you begin with people from China and India ?
_UNK_ : Yes , we &apos;re talking about this today in Long Beach and 1500 audience .
And we &apos;re also talking to 1,000 students at Harvard ,
Chris : I believe that a lot of people will be willing to join this career
So I &apos;m going to talk about the topic ,
OK , I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
One , I &apos;m going to talk about why aging is possible .
Second , I &apos;m going to talk about why we have to do it ,
In many discussions , we should expect to fight aging .
And of course , I &apos;ll talk about the feasibility of aging .
Four , I &apos;m going to talk about why we did this in humans ,
And then , fifth , I may talk about the second half of the show
How do we prove that this _UNK_ of aging is _UNK_ ,
And the first step is to do
how to _UNK_ life in a relatively moderate way --
And I define it as a extension of life ,
and in the middle of the middle , people start using --
until one could actually be called the _UNK_ of aging .
and what you do in the next year
that the probability of being ill is a relationship .
And the last thing -- the fifth thing --
OK , I &apos;m going to start with the extension of human life .
Who _UNK_ for malaria is a good hand ? Please raise your hands .
Is it good to be the hands of the bad people ?
OK . So we all think that malaria is a bad thing .
It &apos;s a very good news because I &apos;m going to tell you the answer .
Now I want you to think about it .
We think malaria is the main cause of bad things ,
is because there is a common feature of malaria and aging .
The only true number of aging killing is much more resistant than malaria .
Now , I love the audience , especially in the U.K. ,
It &apos;s a fox that has been fighting for a long time .
I mean , although I know that most of the people in compassion should be against hunting ,
But we know that many people are not entirely convinced by this logic .
In my opinion , this is actually a good comparison with aging .
You know , a lot of people in the country said , &quot; You know ,
People who live in cities have no rights to tell us what &apos;s going to do .
This is part of the traditional lifestyle that we live in the country ,
We should have the power to continue to do it .
This is a sound of _UNK_ , which controls the number of _UNK_ . &quot;
And the conclusion is that this fox &#91; hunting &#93;
It is a activity that is _UNK_ by civilization .
because no matter whether death is fun or not ,
So , this is what I want to do .
These _UNK_ also have some positive aspects of it .
For example , we should think about all kinds of problems , there are plans ,
to reduce the amount of aging that we &apos;ve done
There is a _UNK_ of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
And you know , these _UNK_ are _UNK_
But the problem is that these arguments are not so dangerous ?
And there &apos;s a little bit of a _UNK_
Is it worse than a hundred people in the early days ?
You know , if you haven &apos;t had a better argument than this ,
I don &apos;t waste my time . This is my opinion of aging .
It &apos;s really strong that we &apos;re going to talk about here .
&quot; Well , if we overcome aging , there &apos;s no human death ,
or at least it was the number of deaths ,
So we don &apos;t need a lot of children ,
You know , a lot of people tried to _UNK_ this problem ,
I don &apos;t agree with these answers . I think they don &apos;t work .
I think this is true that we will face a dilemma in this respect .
we &apos;re going to decide whether there &apos;s a lower family level ,
and say , &quot; Well , the death rate is going to change
Of course , we can live a lot of children in this case .
The next generation of humanity has the right to make this choice .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ should be the choice for the next generation .
then we are equivalent to a fate of our children .
because they were young enough to be healthy ,
that can benefit the treatment of these things .
But because we are _UNK_ , we don &apos;t have to develop these drugs as soon as possible --
We &apos;re not equivalent to getting these people a longer life ,
Why should we be positive in this aspect ?
_UNK_ is not as stupid as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a wise way to cope with aging .
_UNK_ is terrible , but it &apos;s inevitable , so ,
We have to try to get this idea out of our head ,
in a rational way to do what we want to do .
to explain that aging is a good thing .
Of course , the cause of these absurd _UNK_ has two _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) , which is _UNK_ .
as long as it &apos;s _UNK_ that part of our mind is not so certain ,
we can start to fight the aging response ,
This _UNK_ often _UNK_ the problem of aging .
And that &apos;s why we must continue to add forward and talk about this ,
And I would even say that --
to attract people &apos;s attention to getting people to know ,
And they &apos;re _UNK_ in this aspect of this ,
And I &apos;m going to talk about this topic .
And the fundamental reason , I think , why we think aging is inevitable ,
is to conclude with the definition of aging here .
_UNK_ is a kind of dynamic side effect ,
_UNK_ is basically a process that happens in _UNK_ objects , such as cars ,
although our body has a lot of bright self - _UNK_ mechanism ,
&#91; In our body &#93; all the chemicals that we can live every day ,
This is a good definition . So , we can express it ,
We can say , you know , we have this series of events .
There are only two ways of doing it .
These two ways are the old and old medicine .
to try to prevent aging from being treated .
And of course , this is a very short strategy , a lost fight ,
_UNK_ &apos;s approach to the surface looks more likely ,
But unfortunately , we understand very little about metabolism .
In fact , we understand less poor things --
Even cells , we don &apos;t know very much about it .
We just found it a few years ago .
Basically , if we &apos;re going to discuss the extended treatment of life in our lifetime ,
and it will be a very good way later ,
I mean , this is a very good logic ,
And before I tell you why not ,
And we assume that if I say that ,
And we -- let &apos;s say that today --
you can give it to the middle , assume that _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
for 30 years of health care for treatment .
I call it a &quot; robust human _UNK_ . &quot; Okay .
or in the same way , when these treatments reach ,
What has been the impact of different ages ?
You might think that the answer is very simple ,
We can &apos;t just say , &quot; Well , if they &apos;re young enough to do that ,
And the wrong reason is that progress is progress .
It will take a long time to go
human beings could fly on the sky a lot of years ago ,
But wait until _UNK_ found how to fly .
But then , the technology of human flight is very _UNK_ .
I think this is a very strange idea .
the technology of the power flight is going on .
We can imagine every step of these technologies
The next step in the research world is not supposed to be .
In every scientific progress , you will see these steps develop .
And it &apos;s all this in a lot of technology .
For example , computers and _UNK_ are also similar ,
You can also see a medical care technology , like health vaccines , antibiotics ,
So , I think there are two steps that I call a step ,
In fact , it was very young people
Even though these people are middle - aged , when these treatments come
Most of them have long enough to improve the treatment ,
and make them live for more than 50 years .
In other words , they _UNK_ the speed of aging .
and it &apos;s going to be more quickly .
This is a very important point to me .
I guess a lot of people are going to live for a thousand or more years ,
They &apos;re all thinking , oh , we &apos;re going to invent this for decades
how to live in _UNK_ and even more treatment .
I mean , it &apos;s just the _UNK_ treatment for these long lives .
And these treatments , I think , would never be perfect ,
But we will learn how to treat _UNK_ people who have no age of _UNK_ .
Next , we had no three or three years ago , and the three - year - old _UNK_ died .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking forward to .
By certain age , the relative treatment should be _UNK_ .
If you &apos;re 100 years old , or you &apos;re 80 years old ,
We may be hard to do something for you ,
So first , the experimental therapy has no effect on you .
But if you were 50 years old ,
You might be as if I had just described the question of ageing death .
in a sense of what it means to be
Your youth , from your body and brain , your life becomes younger ,
You die from aging and the likelihood of disease will be decreased .
And of course , if you &apos;re not 50 years old ,
And it &apos;s not going to hurt the death of aging .
So , this is a real conclusion that the first one to live in _UNK_ --
We don &apos;t know how old it is now ,
because we don &apos;t know the first generation of _UNK_
I claim the first person to live in _UNK_ --
And of course , _UNK_ the global disaster -- actually ,
The young man who lived to me about ten years old .
OK , I &apos;m going to take the rest of the talk ,
is how we get the first _UNK_ treatment ,
to get us to a _UNK_ speed ?
And to do that , I need to say a little bit about mice .
I have a _UNK_ to the _UNK_ of human beings ,
I &apos;m not a very wealthy imagination to call it a _UNK_ technology .
is that we &apos;re going to take a _UNK_ mouse ,
is equivalent to a mouse that could live three years .
We didn &apos;t have them until they were two years old .
And then we did a bunch of things ,
with the treatment that allows them to extend their lives ,
So , in other words , we began to add these mice to two years of life --
and the three times the same thing is .
And the next question is , when is it ,
What we &apos;re talking about is that we can use it in humans ?
It is known as a strong human regeneration , or a long time away .
Second , when we get the first mouse ,
the public is going to get these things ,
The third question is , how many people want to avoid aging ?
And what I &apos;m going to talk about is that
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do that ,
We should keep quiet simply until we understand more .
It is absolutely _UNK_ to keep quiet and to be silent .
We need to give us the best predictions of time ,
to allow people to have a concept ,
So , I said , from the technology of _UNK_ mice
to achieve the _UNK_ of the human technology .
It may be possible that people will be _UNK_ .
because people tend to _UNK_ the progress of science .
They may be wrong , but it &apos;s not really important .
And of course , I think the public is older
And the main reason for that argument is that
is the global _UNK_ that I talked about .
because the public will never think that aging is inevitable ,
because it has been so effective in the _UNK_ body .
So , we can see people &apos;s ideas are huge changes ,
to tell you how we &apos;re going to get these mice ,
I &apos;m going to add a little bit about aging .
all the things that are occurring in the metabolism ,
And even though these damage will be inevitable ,
They are accumulated from what we &apos;ve been born , and we all accumulate .
because we can _UNK_ our original graph .
We can say that the difference between _UNK_ and _UNK_
And I &apos;ll just explain what I call
in the old _UNK_ , trying to stop _UNK_ .
If we look like this , there &apos;s a third way .
I claim that engineering method is in humans , technology range .
The project will not interfere with any metabolism in our body .
It &apos;s not going to intervention this process , and it doesn &apos;t _UNK_ it .
It &apos;s good , because it means it &apos;s not a lost fight ,
and it &apos;s something that we can do in our current technology ,
&quot; We regularly repair all these different types of damage --
And they don &apos;t have to be completely repaired .
but it &apos;s enough to get us to avoid
a degree that leads to death or ill . &quot;
Because we only get diseases about age when we &apos;re in middle age ,
Even if the damage has been _UNK_ from us .
Why do I say , &quot; engineering &quot; is in humans ? &quot; This is the reason .
The point of this picture is at the bottom .
If we try to say that part of the metabolism is important to aging ,
that we might stay here for a whole night ,
because basically every part of the metabolism has the effect of aging .
This list is just an example , it &apos;s not complete .
They are just a kind of age and age .
But in the middle I argue that this is a complete list ,
All metabolism have the _UNK_ to be called _UNK_ ,
and finally leads to the _UNK_ of death .
Of course , those seven are _UNK_ , but only seven .
cell loss , chromosomes mutation , in the _UNK_ gene mutation , etc .
First of all , I want to explain why I think this list is completely _UNK_ .
Can you say , OK , what are we doing ?
Because if a short life molecule is damaged , it will destroy life --
Like proteins are _UNK_ -- accumulate damage is also destroyed .
So , for this reason , the seven things have been discussed by a bachelor &apos;s _UNK_ .
This is a good news because it means ,
And although we &apos;ve done a lot of work in biology for 20 years ,
The list is only seven things that are very good ,
because it shows that it &apos;s not going to increase .
The news is better than you think of ,
because we know how to solve all these seven things in mice -- my principle is ,
We may actually be able to actually do these _UNK_ in 10 years .
Some of them are already _UNK_ , especially at the top .
I don &apos;t have a time to explain it here ,
But my conclusion is that if we can get good money ,
then we could develop a powerful human _UNK_ within 10 years ,
but we really need to think about it .
And the biologists in the audience are going to be
You may have some questions , and I &apos;ll answer you .
But you have to go to read these ,
And I &apos;m on the basis of this research on aging technology ,
There is a lot more confidence in the challenging schedule .
I hope you can see these data and research to explain why you think I am wrong .
The main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t believe
because in any of the areas of the world
If you have radical ideas , the mainstream must have a bit resistance .
So , you have to really work out ,
One thing is that you &apos;re going to listen to a guy at the next meeting ,
When he said he could sequence the human genome , how did people answer him .
We have different strategies -- there &apos;s a _UNK_ prize ,
and you think it &apos;s going to be possible .
If you &apos;re successful , you can get a _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s a plan to suggest that an institution ,
but it will need to be _UNK_ .
I mean , you see how much money we waste in Iraq ?
The source of these research is best for private _UNK_ , because they will _UNK_ the attention of _UNK_
But I think it &apos;s &quot; 90 percent of the time I put forward these _UNK_ and extended human life . &quot;
because we know how to do it . I &apos;m going to talk about it .
Chris Anderson : Okay . I don &apos;t know if you have any problems ,
but I think I &apos;ll give them a chance .
Audience member : Since you &apos;re talking about aging and trying to fight it ,
Why do you look like a old man ?
_UNK_ : Because I &apos;m a old man . Actually I &apos;m _UNK_ .
Audience member : The species on this planet evolved immune system ,
To fight against all kinds of diseases , the individual lives of enough families .
But I know that all species evolved to death ,
So , when the cell breaks apart , the _UNK_ becomes more and more _UNK_ and dying .
Now , why does evolution seem to have the _UNK_ &apos; for _UNK_ ?
Or that &apos;s just the evolution process that doesn &apos;t work ?
I &apos;m going to tell you the answer to your question ,
And that is , no , aging is not an evolutionary process ,
In other words , we will be aging because there is no aging .
&quot; Because you need more genetic ways , your genes need to be more complex ,
And the more you want to delay aging , you need to face these problems .
is that it &apos;s not a personal thing ,
Audience member : _UNK_ . I heard that in the last 20 years ,
and basically the average life of this planet has been up for ten years .
If I _UNK_ it , if I didn &apos;t have any accident in my _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to be able to live for _UNK_ years .
And that means that I &apos;m going to be one of the things you can live to study ?
Life has been growing every 10 years to two years .
So it &apos;s not as good as you think or hope .
However , I &apos;m going to develop it fast for more than a year .
Audience member : I was told that many of our adult brain cells ,
And the _UNK_ can live about three or four years .
What &apos;s the effect of _UNK_ in the physical world ?
And if all of the cells in my body ,
to live in _UNK_ instead of a typical cell dying in two months ?
And basically what we need to do is replace the brain ,
in some of the regions of the cell ,
especially neurons , but we don &apos;t want to be more
that &apos;s going to replace any cell faster --
because it &apos;s too fast to reduce the cognitive functions .
I just said that there &apos;s no _UNK_ species
There are some species of aging . For example , _UNK_ --
because they don &apos;t have a neural system --
and no cells that are used to aging
In the past , a _UNK_ is a bit easier ,
and even people put our country on eBay _UNK_ .
and your friend &apos;s travel plan for a trip ,
I &apos;m going to talk to you about the story of _UNK_ ,
This is the photograph of our photograph --
which is the first year before the _UNK_ began .
but I can tell you what I &apos;m going to do ,
Our country is like Wall Street and _UNK_ ,
We have some _UNK_ in the world like this ,
And it was _UNK_ to keep the situation .
And it feels like it &apos;s going to go back to the front ,
that we have declared that we are women ,
We believe that the values that we have
And we went up with a group of elite
We worked with the most powerful times in Iceland &apos;s financial storm ,
to be lucky and the elements of the time .
We believe that people should have enough knowledge
to tell them that the bad news they don &apos;t know ,
And even though we work in the financial world ,
And even though we are longing for ourselves and consumers for more economic benefit ,
But we insist on the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
We think profits are not just the next quarter ,
It has a much more _UNK_ meaning .
and the women are going to grow and _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ the new values and the method to bring decision _UNK_ .
What &apos;s good for this ? You can make better decisions .
And the two things that are good for us
And since the financial sector in Iceland --
And the whole Europe is not so _UNK_ ,
There &apos;s a guy in the _UNK_ who has a female .
I &apos;m going to tell you the truth .
And sometimes I have a question about it .
and do the same thing again and again ,
I hope the disaster will not come to our heads .
They &apos;re going to take their wallet to choose ,
And when I first realized that the first time
when I was seven years old -- that was my mother &apos;s birthday --
whether you &apos;re a professional woman or a _UNK_ , all the strike ,
Some people think it &apos;s going to be on the global campaign ,
In my opinion , this is just a long journey ,
_UNK_ , she said she could not be the president ,
because she &apos;s a woman , and she &apos;s only half a woman .
&quot; Listen , I &apos;m not going to show you the _UNK_ ,
and the impact of what they &apos;re doing today .
in my career for 10 to 15 years ,
It &apos;s the same thing for men or women .
We should accept the _UNK_ of each other and _UNK_ the challenges .
And finally , I want to say to you ,
We should start to pursue the beauty of balance .
It &apos;s only that we can change the world to keep sustainable .
especially at the end of the meeting like this .
So I thought , maybe it &apos;s really useful for us to remind us
some of the things that we &apos;ve experienced here ,
And then it might be some of the things that we can take ,
We came here and said we wanted to talk about Africa : The next chapter .
But the reason we &apos;re talking about Africa : The next chapter ,
because we are looking at the past and now ,
I showed you the images , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , death and disease ,
And what we want to see is , &quot; Africa , the next chapter . &quot;
I believe that what we hear is worth remembering ,
I heard all the important statistics of the data ,
The reason is that we have a platform for work .
So , I &apos;m not going to spend too much time
and tell you that Africa is talking about the next chapter , because it &apos;s never before ,
as this continent is developing at an unexpected speed .
We now have five percent of the growth rate ,
And the numbers are growing -- it &apos;s expected to be six to seven percent .
I can tell a long story about foreign debt .
because I personally worked for one of the biggest debt in this continent ,
_UNK_ people fall down to 120 or _UNK_ people .
You know , we &apos;ve set up the reserve , why is this important ?
That &apos;s because it marks our economy , our currency ,
and offer people a platform that can plan , build and do business .
We saw some evidence that we created .
from the _UNK_ to the current _UNK_ .
In 2005 , _UNK_ -- to take Nigeria --
If you spend a lot of money around you , take them back .
Now you &apos;re in the _UNK_ phase , not from that .
Now , why is this important ? Should it be so fast ?
We have our own director , _UNK_ , and other leaders , and they say ,
_UNK_ percent of the population is below 24 years .
And that means that we have to focus on how our youth
In the process of growing up , the _UNK_ build
You have to focus on how to create jobs
to make sure they &apos;re not _UNK_ , they can accept education .
but to make sure that most of them can be produced
They are creating a kind of manufacturing environment
And one of the things that I did after the government
In Nigeria , there was a public survey ,
Most of us don &apos;t even look at the _UNK_ ,
So we can &apos;t understand the needs of the people
I asked them recently , what was their biggest needs .
And in other countries , this needs have been satisfied .
And I want to go back and say ,
But before that , I &apos;m going to let you know
I personally think that the next step in the building
We can &apos;t even talk about the next stage because we &apos;re still in the old stages .
So we don &apos;t forget , build this framework and a lot of resources .
of what we &apos;re trying to do in Nigeria ,
to create our own projects , like _UNK_ ,
Now we can build on this platform right now .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about since .
Some people stood up and said -- the most _UNK_ thing
And that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk about .
The real problem is that we should regulate the government
to develop Africa , to do the need to do
And what I &apos;m going to say is that young people have jobs
So I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re really wrong about it .
I think the people in Africa don &apos;t always have to go to the other extreme .
And _UNK_ says that for a talk about _UNK_ --
He dreamed of having African aid for a day .
And I said , &quot; Yeah , yeah . We &apos;ve been wrong -- we &apos;ve been doing it all the time ! &quot;
Britain and the United States are not going to be
all the resources are _UNK_ from Africa .
So when they come back to aid us , we should not have a _UNK_ .
The problem is how we should use them to give us our resources
Why don &apos;t I get aid , but care if you can use aid
In 1970 , Nigeria had a war -- Nigeria --
I was only 14 years old in the war
We &apos;ve been cooking with my mother a lot of time .
to the military -- my father did the military --
We eat a meal every day and often move
It was a terrible time in the _UNK_ .
We &apos;re almost never going to eat every day .
I believe that you have a little older person
In that time my mother had three days of _UNK_ food .
So I was the biggest one in my house
She was only three years old , and I was 15 years old
She got a serious fever -- we tried all the ways
but it seems that there &apos;s no use in it .
until we heard about 10 kilometers away , she could --
So my sister -- it &apos;s very hot --
She walked her back for ten kilometers .
I &apos;m scared because I know her life depends on how I can go to doctors
We heard that there was a woman who would be ill
I walked over 10 kilometers in a _UNK_ .
There are nearly a thousand people , all join the family .
She &apos;s in a church . How can I get in ?
I have to go forward with these legs .
And when everyone wants to break the door ,
I walked in the window and jumped into the church .
And she said that I was just in time
When we jumped into the church hall , she was almost unable to _UNK_ .
She took a _UNK_ , and I knew the _UNK_ --
and give some sister -- that &apos;s certainly the result of _UNK_ --
Other drugs , put us in a corner
About three hours later , my sister started moving .
And then they gave her _UNK_ , because she started sweating .
About six hours later , she said she could go home .
I walked 10 kilometers back , and this is the easiest way I walked through .
I &apos;m very happy -- my sister has been brought back !
Now , she &apos;s 41 , and she &apos;s the mother of three children .
Why do I say this ? I &apos;m telling you because --
If that &apos;s you -- or your family --
Now I &apos;m not so sad that I think life is saved .
There are some aid in Africa that has this effect .
When you rescued someone &apos;s life , as a farmer , teachers or a mother .
As an economist , we can see the meaning of the story .
These people are in the economy as productive .
So if we save AIDS , if we save malaria ,
These people become the foundation of the economic production .
Like yesterday somebody said , if you were _UNK_ , they were _UNK_ .
and their kids would be the same economic burden
And that &apos;s one reason that my personal experiences told us
is going to be able to _UNK_ our resources
And I want to tell you a lot of people , including me ,
and I don &apos;t believe that this is the only way
And that &apos;s why I say this discussion should be more fine .
You all know Spanish -- the European Union --
from other countries in the European Union for 10 billion dollars ?
The EU aid for 10 billion dollars . Where do they use ?
Have you been to Spain lately ? There &apos;s a road around here .
because of the support of infrastructure , the whole southern Spain ,
Do you know the aid of the Irish _UNK_ ?
Ireland is one of the fastest countries in the EU .
Many people , even the rest of the world ,
What are the three billion dollars in Ireland at the end ?
They said , &quot; No , you know , we &apos;re not going to take this _UNK_ .
And I wonder if they could build the infrastructure
those highways , highways , or other infrastructure
why do they refuse to use the same aid fund
When we asked them , what do they need ?
What I &apos;m worried about now is that we have a lot of funds
We talked about the World Bank , international currency funds , reliability and so on .
We also have some of the _UNK_ citizens
Some of them are in the audience , and some private funds ,
One day , these organizations will have a lot of money
They &apos;re going to replace government aid for the past .
But I &apos;m worried -- I &apos;m very grateful to them .
And what they do for Africa is that
But I was worried . I got up in the stomach ,
because I saw a new aid entrepreneurs in Africa
a lot of attempts to find what should be done
And many of them don &apos;t know much about Africa .
And I didn &apos;t see them working with Africans
And a lot of times I think they &apos;re not interested in
Look at what &apos;s happening in the land and make decisions .
But I &apos;m anxiety because it &apos;s very important for this .
And when they make decisions , we &apos;re not on board ?
Can we make the mistake that we &apos;ve done before ?
our president and leaders -- everybody &apos;s talking about --
There &apos;s no one to call these guys together ,
We sat down , and we were going to negotiate the money .
And everyone was doing their own efforts
Over 10 years , a billion dollars in Africa
We didn &apos;t have the ability to control , and we said ,
We didn &apos;t do that because we were too much , we didn &apos;t coordinate it .
We didn &apos;t call _UNK_ and _UNK_ --
And here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to spend . &quot;
We don &apos;t stop them . There &apos;s no ! But they can help us better .
But let me feel disappointed that we don &apos;t do that .
For 10 years , our problems are still in place .
So the question is how we should coordinate
that are good for what we &apos;re talking about .
I &apos;m also very confident about the private sector .
So maybe some of the ideas are going to work .
They say that the idea of _UNK_ and _UNK_
So why don &apos;t we think about how to use aid
And why don &apos;t we begin to say to those who help us
You can &apos;t get a long time if you don &apos;t build a infrastructure ,
If you build electricity and railways , and so on .
agriculture will develop better if there &apos;s a railway that sends crops to market
So we can see that this is actually integrated .
the private sector and the African can work .
I &apos;m convinced that aid can &apos;t solve our problems
But it can be catalyst . If we don &apos;t use it as catalyst
Why is China more popular for African people --
One of the reasons -- not only is this , some people say you &apos;re stupid .
This is because the Chinese know more about the economy ,
If you tell them , &quot; We need to build the road here . &quot;
In fact , the Chinese financial minister said to me
And when I asked him where he was in Nigeria ,
He says you just need to do two things .
And the same thing is , we need infrastructure , infrastructure and planning .
So we can make _UNK_ Liu help us give some infrastructure
Now I realized that I wasn &apos;t saying , healthcare and education
Let &apos;s see how aid is a _UNK_ , in cooperation ,
They worry that there &apos;s a big risk in Africa
why some aid can &apos;t be used to guarantee
But finally , because they stood up -- I spent my time -- I did it .
One of the things is that I think everyone is united .
There &apos;s a lot of talk about women here , and I don &apos;t want to repeat
But some women are actually creating jobs
When you take the resources to manage women
The World Bank in 2000 has shown that
It &apos;s better for children and family , and it &apos;s going to be better and better .
So what I want to say is that
I don &apos;t want to say that men are not important .
It was obvious that if women left her husband , what would they do
And that leads us to the difficulty that we don &apos;t want to see .
The woman didn &apos;t work for a woman
But at least , we -- I want to push this idea
not automatically -- but they tend to get more help .
and it &apos;s also useful for women in Africa .
_UNK_ created 200 jobs in the flower business in Rwanda .
In Nigeria , _UNK_ furniture -- the chair --
So the next question is how you _UNK_
the resources that women have control for women
who want to expand companies and create more jobs
to participate in the government , the private sector ,
I &apos;ve never been able to talk to you about
&quot; I really want you to do some creative things in the surgery . &quot;
So I think this is a little bit _UNK_ .
I mean , I did so many _UNK_ ,
For me , the _UNK_ _UNK_ of sound
and led me to become a physician ,
and study the acoustic , especially the music of it .
So I want to go through the next few minutes
How do I study music in the world
How do the brain work on how to create
and so on and on and on .
Most of my work was done at _UNK_ University ,
and some of the countries that I worked in
I &apos;m going to show you a clip of the video .
This is a clip from Keith _UNK_ , a famous _UNK_ composer ,
the most famous person , the most representative character .
He will not play the second time in the same way .
Why don &apos;t we click this video to see it .
This is really amazing , wonderful _UNK_ music .
I was a faithful audience , a fan ,
So I started with this idea , and science thought
Art is a wonderful thing , but not magic .
And I started with this research project ,
It &apos;s like looking at other complex _UNK_ processes .
And I think I have some potential problems .
I want to tell you most of the music science
It &apos;s hard to find music in those studies .
In fact , they are completely not in music .
is completely lost in the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
Maybe we &apos;re not the right person to ask this question .
But what I &apos;m going to say is , from the scientific perspective of science ,
What we know about the brain is how to create
In fact , what we do is we create _UNK_ .
So we &apos;re going to be able to do this
a real scientific innovation will come from prosperity .
We now have a new way to help us .
And all of us have a remarkable brain ,
And I &apos;m not going to give you a lot of answers today ,
This is basically what I did in the lab .
I asked the brain what makes us do this .
This is my main way , this is the functional MRI imaging .
If you take MRI _UNK_ , they &apos;re the same ,
But this is a special thing to do
and take pictures of the brain &apos;s active zone .
And the whole process is going to be done ,
And when the brain is active , the nervous region ,
We measured the flow of blood , not the nerve activity .
We can say that part of the brain has more blood ,
Now I &apos;m going to talk about one of my studies
This is what I did with my colleague Alan _UNK_ .
This is a video that we did with this experiment .
Charles _UNK_ : This is a _UNK_ keyboard for plastic .
is to design it in the scanner ,
This mat can put on the leg of the player ,
They were _UNK_ in their scanner . They were _UNK_ .
This is a job like this , it doesn &apos;t make sound .
It &apos;s called the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ signal .
by the wire to the box and the computing machine ,
We can have the way to record music .
So what do you do with this cool piano key ?
You can &apos;t say , &quot; Well , we have a keyboard . &quot;
We have to come up with a really scientific experiment .
The experiment is actually made up of the following content .
How does the brain respond to music when people play memories ?
And I have a example of this here .
This is a musical paradigm that needs to be _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
And this is what I call a jazz paradigm .
We _UNK_ a professional jazz player in the National Health Center ,
We let them remember the music on the left , the lower left ,
And we let them use the same kind of _UNK_ .
If you put the button on the _UNK_ ,
This is an example of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
In the end , this is not the most natural environment ,
And it was a very comfortable thing to do .
We first measured the number of notes .
Do they play a lot of notes at _UNK_ ?
I &apos;m going to put this together to you .
A active area on the left side of the skin is red ,
The blue areas are not active in areas .
So we see the side of the frontal lobe
We can see the side of the frontal lobe
It &apos;s very low , and I &apos;m here to summarize it .
And as I say , this is not a jazz part of the brain .
The area of the _UNK_ control is closed ,
So we thought , at least the initial thought ,
You need to achieve this strange separation with your brain .
a region opens , a big area is closed ,
So you can &apos;t feel the right , you want to make mistakes ,
Many people know that music is not always a single activity ,
How does the brain act when the _UNK_ play each other ?
Is this a common way of jazz in _UNK_ ?
And here I split it into four _UNK_ ,
We did the same way to arrange a _UNK_ to scanner ,
and then let another player in the control room
The best _UNK_ in the world , a wonderful steel player .
_UNK_ : Mike _UNK_ , &quot; I &apos;m going to show you .
_UNK_ : You have the right attitude to doing this experiment .
He &apos;s in it , you can see his leg there .
And I was in the control room , and we were _UNK_ .
And the reason we did it over and over again
The actor made me a little harder for me ,
In addition to my hand I am completely _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to take a minute .
When he was playing four _UNK_ , _UNK_ was not memory ,
But the _UNK_ on the right side of his brain is the same performance .
This area is thought to be about expression and communication .
The music is the idea of language ,
And the final thing is that there &apos;s a _UNK_ basis ,
We can see it through two _UNK_ music .
We &apos;ve done a similar experiment for eight objects ,
I hope we can make some meaningful conclusions from it .
When we talk about _UNK_ and language , what do we think about ?
Let &apos;s put a video here in this room .
_UNK_ _UNK_ : ? I am rice _UNK_ , I have five feet high ? _UNK_ ?
There &apos;s a lot of similar _UNK_ to it .
In fact , I think in different times , there are lots of different places
In many ways , _UNK_ has done a lot of jazz
This is what you &apos;re going to do : you want a free _UNK_ artist .
and remember the _UNK_ of their _UNK_ ,
I told my lab members that I would be _UNK_ at TED ,
This big screen , can you be _UNK_ with me , OK ?
This is the condition of control . This is what they remember .
? When I _UNK_ , I was like climbing the peak , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
? My passion doesn &apos;t correspond to my fashion , you can &apos;t see how _UNK_ are _UNK_ ?
? I need a crazy scientist to understand my _UNK_ brain , _UNK_ ?
They don &apos;t know what you give them , but they &apos;ll be _UNK_ immediately .
We will give them the words that love _UNK_ , &apos; _UNK_ &apos; .
_UNK_ said , &quot; I &apos;m a little bit like the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ : It &apos;s an incredible thing to happen again .
whether or not you like music or not ,
This little clip shows how we use _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : By the way , this is from the scanner .
? When I _UNK_ _UNK_ , I &apos;m like climbing the peak _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
? My passion doesn &apos;t correspond to my fashion , you can &apos;t see how _UNK_ are _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ : OK , that &apos;s over here . What do you see in his brain ?
What do we see ? We see some of the languages are active ,
You see a lot of _UNK_ activity in the old brain .
If you have creative activity and just just _UNK_ activity ,
The brain activity is more active in the creative activity .
It &apos;s also a very preliminary study , but I think it &apos;s cool .
In short , we have a lot of problems to extend .
As I say , we &apos;re here to ask questions , rather than answering the question .
But we want to understand the truth of creating talent .
I think , in these ways , we &apos;re closer to the goal .
I hope that in the next 10 years , 20 years ,
It &apos;s saying that science is going to look for art ,
I &apos;m grateful to you to listen to my talk .
We have to give the machine a piece of instructions ,
to allow the machine to do what we want to do .
is that it &apos;s going to be very complicated and fun ,
It &apos;s possible to increase this area from psychological capability ,
may come from the same part of the brain ,
so that you can use it in a _UNK_ crowd .
is the same thing you see in the picture .
This is often going to have a process of wearing light .
to spend millions of dollars on the planet .
A speaker came to the stage and came in .
It takes a few minutes to set up
so that you can move the freedom .
and the _UNK_ of the United States
is going to be an unexpected thing .
He was obviously not _UNK_ -- so we choose to add users . &quot;
And what we &apos;re going to do first is ,
And at the same time , the screen will show
because the system doesn &apos;t know what he thought of .
And so we have a little bit of time ,
because it &apos;s going to be thought about it .
So , what you &apos;re going to do -- first to do a movement --
We &apos;ve been doing this in reality , so we can see this movement .
Imagine the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ , right ?
Like that . So , one , two , three , three , start .
_UNK_ : But we can see that this is possible ,
because there &apos;s a process of _UNK_ the machine --
And this system is _UNK_ in this software .
They can &apos;t stop adding more ways of detection ,
So I want to show you some examples ,
to improve your experience in the real world .
You know , the control system of the human interface
for example , the control of the electronic _UNK_ .
We &apos;ve just _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the system today .
We want you to help us come up
The technology will follow . Thank you very much .
We invented it as a purpose to do it .
The invention is a very interesting thing .
Because the interest is always _UNK_ , if it &apos;s not fun ,
And we also have some innovation plans to serve _UNK_ .
to solve the problems in the world ? &quot;
and then we can solve it in our way .
_UNK_ is one of the most _UNK_ of us .
And he &apos;s also a good job , and I &apos;m grateful to you .
But a lot of vaccines in the developing world
This is because the vaccine needs to be _UNK_ .
Almost all the vaccines will be saved by _UNK_ temperature .
And if there &apos;s no steady power supply , you can &apos;t maintain the temperature ,
It &apos;s not just the problem that we &apos;ve lost the vaccine .
The important thing is that children don &apos;t find a vaccine .
These are the _UNK_ _UNK_ . They &apos;re going to carry together ,
or to ship it with a truck .
It can maintain the temperature of four hours of ice .
So we thought , well , maybe it &apos;s not good enough .
And we can think about the way that this is
First of all , this is the same principle of temperature .
You can put a liquid nitrogen or a _UNK_ in it .
Because once you put the bottle into the hand ,
And the heat goes into the bottle , the bottle has lost .
So , from this point , this is actually like a Coke .
We want this idea to change the vaccine
malaria is one of the big public health problems .
We &apos;re in this country , and we don &apos;t have a solution .
to really understand what the numbers mean to the disease .
that people have spent a lot of years
You can use spray , but this is the problem of environmental pollution .
You can try to cure the patient and make them a sense of preventing disease .
It &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s just the most serious place
People have tried for a long time . There are some potential _UNK_ .
malaria is a disease that is hard to find against vaccines .
If people use nets , it &apos;s going to be a very effective way .
But people don &apos;t use malaria nets . They &apos;re fishing nets .
but they don &apos;t have the disease to disappear .
And this is one of the reasons we &apos;re interested in it .
It &apos;s the same principle as the insulin glucose _UNK_ .
in the machine , you can automatically tell your diagnosis results .
But now , you need to do a _UNK_ lab
If you don &apos;t need the blood to draw better .
or look at the blood vessels of the ball ,
And in fact , you can do that .
because you can actually see the blood vessels through your nails .
Once you see the blood vessels , we think there might be malaria .
We can do a lot of cool things with it .
that you can do all kinds of interesting things .
The _UNK_ pigment and the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
can actually find _UNK_ and filter it into the blood system .
We all like to try to solve some software .
If you want to eliminate or reduce malaria ,
You don &apos;t know what method is most effective .
The pool became a breeding ground for the mosquito .
And so you set the program for this step .
This means the late season in the late season .
because there &apos;s no place to make the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Of course , at the second year , everything was _UNK_ .
We &apos;re going to be able to do tens of times .
to simulate the balance of the economy --
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
is that the cost of _UNK_ and the spray
This is why you &apos;re going to talk about these little equipment here .
So if we combine these things together ,
How would they launch a laser to the sky ?
Now , in our company , we call it
Look , we can protect the target of _UNK_ like a clinic .
They were all sick , so they were able to _UNK_ the mosquito .
And before you kill these bugs , you know ,
You can listen to the frequency of the wing ,
In fact , we only need to kill female _UNK_ .
In fact , in the lab , we use grapes to feed them .
All right , this legal department is ready to make a statement .
We thought that maybe we could use a _UNK_ laser
And this is going to stay on the mosquito for a long time .
There is a box on the other side of the stage .
You can see that the _UNK_ fly in there .
And _UNK_ , if he was a little bit _UNK_ ,
And here you can see these bugs here .
And then we can actually use a laser _UNK_
We actually measured the frequency of the wings .
So you might hear some of the mosquito flying around .
Because of a laser , you can see the mosquito _UNK_ .
to give you a chance to see what &apos;s happening .
This is a system that we &apos;re specially designed for TED .
This shows that a system is feasible to develop such a system .
We &apos;re working hard to reduce the cost of using it .
that can be used in other countries in Africa and the world .
_UNK_ : If we don &apos;t show you a laser ,
When you shoot them , this demonstration is not fun .
This is one of the things we make .
We &apos;re going to be around here , and you &apos;ll see another one .
And the interesting thing is that we always kill them .
We &apos;ve never been really _UNK_ their wings in the air .
But in the course of the wing , it still turns .
Now we &apos;re spending every _UNK_ food in Britain ,
If anyone wants to take back the house , please let us know .
I spent a long time -- 25 years -- came up with this idea .
First of all , we &apos;re going to plant , and this is a lot of energy ,
to get people to the belly , and hope you will be satisfied .
And this is the most _UNK_ stage .
There &apos;s a waste of time , someone wasted space , someone waste energy ,
is going to be able to reduce the waste .
OK , what are you going to ask about environmental restaurant ?
I &apos;m going to show you a couple of ideas :
This is a bench , although it &apos;s very uncomfortable ,
But she went to the local auction and bought some _UNK_ ,
If it doesn &apos;t work , I &apos;m going to do that ,
It &apos;s like the wind power , the light bulb in it is all _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s important for those who work in the restaurant all day .
I &apos;ve been doing this , and I don &apos;t know if you look out ,
I &apos;ve been thinking about something that &apos;s natural ,
It looks better than a new one . It &apos;s nice to be here .
and again the _UNK_ use the same bottle .
Look at this _UNK_ tree , it &apos;s actually taken into a car tire ,
We _UNK_ the tire and _UNK_ it up again .
I put some _UNK_ in it , and I grew this _UNK_ tree , great !
This is the kitchen , in the same room .
I &apos;m going to let the customer decide how much weight it is to eat .
Well , this kitchen is not big , it &apos;s about five meters square ,
But what I &apos;m saying is not to _UNK_ the waste , but to reduce waste .
I put the waste food into dry water ,
You see all the soil in the yard , and it &apos;s all _UNK_ ,
And I put the waste into the _UNK_
to deal with about 70 kg of vegetable waste every week ,
and all kinds of worms have these kinds of _UNK_ ,
to get bugs in front of them , &quot; Give you a dinner . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how many bugs have ,
But I thought I would have a serious _UNK_ !
What you see here is the _UNK_ system ,
through this layer of stone that should be used to _UNK_ the field ,
I &apos;m going to filter the water out of the garden .
And I &apos;d like to go back and recycle these water ,
If I could build the _UNK_ into a restaurant without carbon emissions ,
you don &apos;t have to start with the gas , that must be great !
This restaurant looks a little bit like a _UNK_ ,
are all made in Britain , and they &apos;re very _UNK_ ,
all use electricity , including restaurants and kitchen ,
because I think it &apos;s too much energy for me ,
the amazing _UNK_ that _UNK_ on the roof ,
and the wind slowly _UNK_ into the restaurants ,
to make them feel _UNK_ , or _UNK_ , with the season .
There is a river outside the restaurants ,
and indoor temperatures , about four degrees of temperature .
I don &apos;t know how it works , but I spent a lot of money .
The best thing is , there &apos;s a chef in the restaurant ,
to live in the boat , not use electricity , but by itself ,
His fruit he needed was such a _UNK_ !
The theme of the _UNK_ House is that the water house is water ,
And I was thinking , I thought , well , I thought ,
I &apos;ve been _UNK_ and wood , and I &apos;m going to open a fire restaurant ,
You &apos;ll be waiting for a look at it !
only to get people who are _UNK_ with me ,
but I want to take my food out of it .
or those who believe that they work together ,
I &apos;m going to sell potato , and I &apos;m going to sell milk ,
I want _UNK_ and broccoli -- it &apos;s all important food .
ready for the box , and then _UNK_ some _UNK_ ,
There is also a recovery of the register and the _UNK_ .
In fact , I wanted to take this supermarket
All of nature is in a closed cycle ,
And we &apos;ll have these waste in the end of the day ,
And I &apos;m going to ask you to know ,
We can do it as long as we take some responsibility ,
And this is where I have three companies like this ,
to recycle , and all of that is written below .
_UNK_ is the last point I want to emphasize ,
So there are four points , not just three .
I think we &apos;re going to move forward in the ideal place .
The three companies are not perfect , they represent my ideas .
I think we &apos;re going to meet a lot of difficulties ,
But I &apos;m sure it &apos;s going to be a solution ,
I want to introduce you to a project
And they &apos;re made by this kind of _UNK_ .
and you can see the work we &apos;ve done before .
_UNK_ : The _UNK_ will end up on the beach
_UNK_ : I want to show these _UNK_ on the beach
They learn to walk for a few years
_UNK_ : These _UNK_ are not from food , but energy from wind
and wind up the back , and drive four legs .
The _UNK_ walk on the beach with soft dirt .
when it &apos;s close to waves or _UNK_ , it will stop .
_UNK_ : This is a group based on genetic code .
It &apos;s also a species , and it &apos;s unique .
and look at this monster , the _UNK_ ,
And now it &apos;s , oh , it &apos;s a _UNK_ .
When the wind _UNK_ the air on the head of the _UNK_ ,
to use these energy . If the wind stopped ,
or the _UNK_ , and the reserve energy can be used .
so that they can go to the _UNK_ , because they &apos;re very easily drowned .
To be able to walk well , the accuracy of _UNK_ is critical .
There are 11 numbers , and I call 11 _UNK_ .
And the numbers that make it move well
In fact , this is a new wheel
The axis of the wheel is on the same line .
and the same line is going to be stopped at the same time .
In fact , this is more powerful than the wheels .
because when you try to ride a bicycle on the beach ,
The wheels will be aware of every single inch of land
So , after the _UNK_ of the wheels ,
We create a new wheel . We &apos;re going to show you
But it can also take the wind and wind
It &apos;s only a small animal that uses the bottle to walk .
It has a device that can _UNK_ the sensor
You see this monster , it walks to the other direction .
So they can avoid all the risks of the beach
The biggest danger is the sea . This is the ocean .
It has to have the ability to perceive water
It &apos;s very important . Usually it can breathe in the air
And it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
So imagine that when animals walk out of the ocean ,
When you get to sea , you should hear the sound of the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ ! If it doesn &apos;t perceive it , it &apos;ll be drowned , right ?
This is the counter , and it &apos;s counting the pace
And when it comes to the ocean , you know ,
will change the sequence of 0 and one .
so that it &apos;s a simple brain to perceive its position .
The brain tells the _UNK_ , the sea _UNK_ , where they are .
It helps to live in the sea to reveal a simple world .
Once the nose stopped motion , the _UNK_ would be still _UNK_ .
When the nose was fixed , the entire monster was _UNK_ on the ground .
When the wind changes , the _UNK_ will follow the direction of the wind .
Over the last few years , these _UNK_ can live alone .
And then it &apos;s the smallest chromosome that _UNK_ tissue ,
And we thought , is this a _UNK_ species
You can only remove a single one of the things
to do a branch of the human genome sequence .
and try to make a series of continuous clips
We need a lot of steps to achieve that . There are two problems .
that if we have these new chemical components ,
When we start working , we think synthetic is the biggest problem .
Some of you have found that we &apos;ve abandoned the smallest chromosome .
We need to explain why this is going to work .
So we can only get a few cycles in a year .
One of the most important jobs we published
I think , in philosophy , that &apos;s what we did .
We didn &apos;t know that it would cost us
But I didn &apos;t have the success of this chromosome ,
We think part of it is that it grows _UNK_ .
and finally proven that as a _UNK_ target ,
There &apos;s a _UNK_ that is _UNK_ in the surface of DNA .
You have to do it or do it ,
But we have a problem because now we are
We also need to solve the problem of how to _UNK_ bacteria .
And we think it &apos;s going to be a great experiment ,
to learn how to take the chromosomes out of yeast .
but we can &apos;t transplant it to start a cell .
The small problem took the study of the group for two years .
and finally found that the DNA in the cells
The _UNK_ prevents the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ cells ,
And we found that if we put the chromosomes
And once we &apos;ve done this , we can do it .
when we published our work in the science magazine ,
And we &apos;re going to be in the biology world
And it turns out that this is not a simple job .
And over the sequence of a million _UNK_
to see if it can be _UNK_
And we found that we were able to
and found that only one had to be removed
we can put the DNA barrier in a big piece of clip
So we spent three months trying to find that mistake .
And the result is a very long process
And the result is a very long process
And the result is a very long process
And there &apos;s a long time in the field
But they &apos;re just _UNK_ and not biologists .
Mike _UNK_ and his research group developed the code
We were criticized because there was no meaning .
We &apos;re not going to give the rest of the code .
The second is &quot; Look at things , don &apos;t see what they are .
because this is a technological progress in science .
I &apos;d like to ask the last thing I said before .
And it &apos;s not just the level of technology .
This is a great deal of discussion in science .
and the _UNK_ of the federal government have discussed
And this work is done by _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
to decide how to _UNK_ this job and publishing
And finally they decided to release the release
And I &apos;m going to ask you a question next .
Chris _UNK_ : What do we need to explain ?
I don &apos;t know how important it is .
And we actually think that this is the first step
And this will be a very powerful tool .
because it costs more than a few weeks ago
So when you &apos;re looking at the H1N1 _UNK_ ,
If there is drugs that prevent ordinary cold is not a good thing ?
And I think the latest Gulf of Mexico
to build new hydrocarbons to their _UNK_ ,
I promise that I will be back to the _UNK_ .
because I was just living in the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
But the problem is , why is most people _UNK_ about this ?
is that we think of _UNK_ as a book .
as if we could _UNK_ in a _UNK_ afternoon ,
The _UNK_ recorded the words of God --
This is why _UNK_ is so easy to be quoted --
and the Muslim _UNK_ and the _UNK_
I realized that I had to read a _UNK_ --
Because it , I was _UNK_ with the early history of Islam ,
I &apos;m going to be like a visitor , to travel --
And this is what we call the _UNK_ .
because I took three months to do it .
I have _UNK_ the temptation to see the final end ,
In the reading of the _UNK_ , but obviously the more mysterious chapter .
I wonder if I was in a strange _UNK_ way .
_UNK_ the law and the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) .
Let me recall those night , listening to the old man
A composition of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
to get it to the tip of the tongue , the ear .
The human being is just the _UNK_ of God ,
that are only _UNK_ to the Bible ,
And only when there was no other treaty ,
Only when they tried to stop you in the daytime ,
&quot; Some statements are so clear that it says ,
In fact , the entire _UNK_ of _UNK_
than most of the things we believe in .
There is no indication that the _UNK_ breast or the chest of the _UNK_ .
or it &apos;s like the _UNK_ of the Greek language ,
It seems to me that it was a _UNK_
And this is what happened in _UNK_ , in _UNK_ ,
Most Islam is equivalent to what it is .
I study ants because I like to think about how the organization works .
And especially the simple individual in the organization
how to create the entire behavior through interaction .
So , _UNK_ is a very good example .
And there are lots of other examples , like the Internet .
They all _UNK_ in the _UNK_ , every _UNK_ has one or several _UNK_ .
All those women you see are busy with no family ability .
All _UNK_ have a common feature , which is no central control .
_UNK_ are responsible for _UNK_ . There is no mechanism in the _UNK_ .
There was no ant to command the behavior of other ants .
So I tried to understand the principle of _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been studying in the last 20 years
A ant that lives on the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
This is my research site , and the ants are _UNK_ ,
These _UNK_ are called _UNK_ because they eat the seeds of plants .
This is a _UNK_ , which is the _UNK_ .
They may go to 20 meters outside of search for food .
_UNK_ the seeds and bring the seeds back to the storage store .
Every year I go to my research site , I &apos;ll draw a _UNK_ chart .
This is a road , which is not big ,
On one side there are about 250 meters , the other side is 400 meters .
I have the name of every single _UNK_ ,
and put the numbers on stone . I &apos;ve been going to go over the last year .
looking for the _UNK_ of the last year
Look at what has been dead and put the new _UNK_ out at the bottom .
And so I knew that they had their own age .
That &apos;s because , as the _UNK_ grew more and more and more ,
I &apos;d like to tell you the life cycle of life .
The ants are not able to live more ants , but they will make more .
every year , every _UNK_ would send a _UNK_ ant --
These are the _UNK_ wings -- they &apos;re going to do it .
So every year , and on the same day -- it &apos;s amazing every year --
every _UNK_ would send a wing without mate , and _UNK_ ,
and they fly to a common place to mate .
This is a _UNK_ _UNK_ . That &apos;s the wings .
It &apos;s going to mate with this one ,
And there &apos;s a _UNK_ line up there .
And then the mate died . The ending ended up .
and then they &apos;re going to fly somewhere and take off their wings .
digging a hole into the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
They will live 15 or 20 years , and they will be
It &apos;s got eggs -- they &apos;re starting to eat eggs and become _UNK_ .
It _UNK_ the fat of the body to feed the _UNK_ .
In _UNK_ , the first litter of ants appeared .
They were _UNK_ , and then _UNK_ , and then became _UNK_ .
And then they went to hunt for _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ _UNK_ , the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
That &apos;s the _UNK_ , it &apos;s a pen , as a scale .
This is a _UNK_ built last summer in _UNK_ .
The ants made a large pile of junk -- most of the seeds leaving .
This is five - year - old _UNK_ . This is a pen , as a scale .
This is the biggest _UNK_ , the entrance to about a meter wide .
This is the pattern of scale and the number of _UNK_ --
In a few years , with the change of age of survival .
At first , there was no ant , just a _UNK_ .
After five years , the ants grew up to 10,000 or _UNK_ .
and the number is going to stay alive ,
It was that when _UNK_ reached 15 or 20 years old , when there was no way to reproduce more .
when the ants were stable , they were about five years old .
which is to give more wings and _UNK_ to mate .
And the reason why I knew that the scale of survival
It was because I knew the time of survival , and a number of ants .
And although it &apos;s interesting , it &apos;s not the most interesting thing in the process .
What I think in the ant process is called _UNK_ .
how the _UNK_ is going to try to adjust
the number of _UNK_ in the work of _UNK_ ?
It was raining , and the rain _UNK_ the desert .
you need more ants to put up their _UNK_ .
You know , when you go out for a picnic --
and we need more _UNK_ to collect food .
But since there was no ant to tell what was going to do , that was how the whole thing was going on .
How much does the number of _UNK_ work ?
I call this coordination process for the task distribution .
in the _UNK_ , the work of ants out there
It &apos;s divided into four classes : this is a _UNK_ .
It walked along the way to search for food , to eat food ,
_UNK_ -- that should be a glass glass --
is a group of interesting guys , and they go out early in the morning .
They managed to find the direction of hunting ants ,
and they can do it -- it &apos;s just going to be _UNK_ --
They told the ants to go out and out .
and the ants are working in the _UNK_ ,
What I &apos;d like to say is that _UNK_ &apos;s house similar to Bill .
They _UNK_ the wall with the wet soil .
and then it became something like a mud brick .
_UNK_ is also a lot like the place
and the cave in the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
and the ants are working in the _UNK_
and then _UNK_ the dry soil in the back ,
So you can see these ants bring some soil ,
and then put the soil down and turned back to _UNK_ .
Finally , the main chemical material in the _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
So what you see is that these ants are _UNK_ a bunch of junk ,
And this day , the garbage is all over , the next day ,
they move the garbage to the rest , and then they move back .
These are the ants that work outside the _UNK_
These ants accounted for 25 percent of the entire population , and they were the most senior ants .
So the ants are starting to move closer to _UNK_ ,
When we dig out , we found these _UNK_
Like the width of the _UNK_ , the length of time is a meter long .
And there &apos;s a long channel and a _UNK_ , where we usually find _UNK_ .
And then we found it after eight hours of rock .
I know that _UNK_ was not supposed to look at my _UNK_ ,
The _UNK_ is around here , and it &apos;s only _UNK_ .
It &apos;s _UNK_ , and they eat most of the food ,
What you see is that those busy _UNK_ don &apos;t eat .
They brought the food back to the baby .
The ant takes food into the _UNK_ and just put it on it .
Other ants take food out of the little room below ,
Put the food into the _UNK_ , the seed &apos;s shell and put the seeds together .
And the ants who are responsible for the maintenance are busy .
It &apos;s strange , and it &apos;s funny , at any time ,
About half of the ants were _UNK_ out of it .
&quot; Look at these ants &#91; _UNK_ &#93; , _UNK_ , &quot;
In fact , you can see the ants as _UNK_ .
That means that if something happens -- but I never found it ,
But I &apos;ve only been focused on 20 years --
If something happens , they can go out and work according to what they need .
But in fact , most of them are _UNK_
I think this is a very interesting problem --
_UNK_ is the question of how the organization works .
may let us know what the _UNK_ ant is doing .
They &apos;re kind of like the ants in the deep world
and a buffer with an ant outside the outside work .
If you put them outside the _UNK_ and dig a _UNK_
So when they were young , they were working in the _UNK_ ,
Finally , the team was involved in the outside work .
Once they work outside , they will never be very deep .
The ants -- most of them , including these _UNK_ , are not good .
They have eyes that can distinguish light and darkness ,
And what I &apos;m going to say is that you generally know about _UNK_
You know , even if there is intelligence ,
to send chemical information through the room network
But these are not possible to convey in time ,
The work of the ant outside is _UNK_ to change .
So , in this respect , we know that _UNK_ is not in command work .
So when I first started studying the mission distribution ,
Is there any effect on the ant looking for _UNK_ ?
Are the ants that are responsible for _UNK_ ?
I &apos;ve been thinking about this : every ant in _UNK_
Instead , what do I want to ask is the difference between different types of work ?
So I did a experiment , just changed one element in _UNK_ .
For example , I put a bunch of _UNK_ on the _UNK_ ,
to work more for the maintenance of the ant .
The earliest activity in the morning maintenance of the _UNK_ .
And this is a picture of 20 minutes later ,
And these ants moved all the _UNK_ into the room
is far away from the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
And the ants in this case need to be more responsible for maintenance .
Is it going to affect the ants that work on other jobs ?
And the next step we took these markers ,
So we can put every ant out , so we know what it is .
and find these nice little Nissan marks .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in a different job .
So if you change the number of ants that work ,
and the ants are going to clean up ,
This conclusion applies to all kinds of _UNK_ work .
The second conclusion that we can make a lot of people _UNK_ ,
A ant does not work in the same work .
For example , if I put some food over there , not just lost ants ,
And the ants stopped working at hand , they went out to food .
But it &apos;s not all _UNK_ . This is what they &apos;re doing .
As I say , if there are more food to move , those _UNK_ ants ,
The ant in charge of maintenance can be a _UNK_ .
like I made some trouble , so I needed more _UNK_ ants ,
But if you need more of the ant for maintenance ,
For example , I put a bunch of _UNK_ --
There &apos;s no other _UNK_ back to work for the maintenance of ants ,
They must be _UNK_ out of the ant in the _UNK_ .
So who can do it , and the ants in the _UNK_ are _UNK_ .
And finally , it looks like every single _UNK_
All times are made to decide what to do .
For example , if you need to do a job ,
the ants don &apos;t change . I know they &apos;re not going to do that .
But the ants who hunt for a certain reason could not help .
And so the most amazing result : the task distribution .
This process is like the change of the age of _UNK_ .
When I did experiments with older _UNK_ --
the ones that live five years or more long --
And they move from one situation to another ,
The more I _UNK_ them , the more they are not _UNK_ .
Only two - year - old ants , appear more variable .
And it was amazing that _UNK_ lived a year .
So , the more _UNK_ in the older _UNK_ ,
is not much older than the young ones .
So this is not because the older ants have experienced , more intelligent ,
And the biggest change is the scale of _UNK_ .
And since I came up with this conclusion , I took a long time to figure out
What a rule of _UNK_ is that the law must be simple , and there is a possibility of _UNK_ in the presence of _UNK_ or chemical _UNK_ .
Since no ants can look at the global scale , every ant is using this rule --
And it &apos;s going to happen in the _UNK_ .
In a more step , I found that the ants are using a touch network .
and you see people who can see them touch their _UNK_ ,
And they can tell smell . For example , each other is not the same _UNK_ .
because the ants are going to be _UNK_
_UNK_ a layer with a special odor of oil .
So we knew that the ants were _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
The chance and frequency of other _UNK_ ants to decide what to do .
So the message of the _UNK_ is not the general information ,
and they communicate , and it &apos;s actually the chance .
I &apos;d like to talk a little more about it .
How do you figure out what &apos;s happening -- for example , I &apos;m looking for ants ,
I expected that I would often meet other ants ,
But if I met more ants in charge of maintenance ,
These _UNK_ , the oil of the ant &apos;s appearance ,
The greater the surface of this compound is ,
So they have different smells of different kinds of work .
And they can use this kind of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
They can use these odor after a brief _UNK_ .
to the frequency of the other _UNK_ ant .
And we took this concentrated _UNK_ , small _UNK_ ,
and gently _UNK_ the access to the right frequency ,
And it turns out that _UNK_ is in the right frequency .
These tiny _UNK_ that concentrate on _UNK_ compounds ,
So I want to show you a little video --
At first , what you see is the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
The ants are _UNK_ in the entrance to the _UNK_ .
They &apos;re going to do different jobs , when they get into the _UNK_ ,
They have decided that the frequency of contact , or the impact
every ant is going out and decide what to do .
This is taken by fiber microscope . This is in the _UNK_ .
It seems to be playing the fiber microscope ,
But the key is that these _UNK_ are there ,
every one would feel like &quot; Other _UNK_ &quot; --
&#91; Do they get out of the microscope &#93; and do what they do .
You can see these ants in the _UNK_ are like this .
Every ant , when it comes back , it &apos;s in contact with other ants .
that the ants in the _UNK_ are _UNK_ ,
to decide whether or not to go out ,
So , the most interesting part of this system is _UNK_ .
It &apos;s _UNK_ , and there &apos;s a lot of interference . And especially in two ways :
One is the experience of _UNK_ -- every ant experience -- it &apos;s not clear .
because the frequency of the ant comes back
Every ant is going out to work when he works .
The second is that the ant _UNK_ the chance
It must be rough because there is no ant going to work accurately .
So we did a lot of simulation work .
to figure out that when these two interference ,
As a whole , the act of _UNK_ can predict .
And at the same time , I don &apos;t think that this unexpected communication ,
It can build the same precision and efficiency of the factory .
In fact , if you look at these ants , you will eventually want to help them .
and you think they should have _UNK_ in the way .
So this mechanism is _UNK_ because of these accidental contact .
The ants have lived for hundreds of years .
And in general , it must be very successful ,
to make the numbers of ants more and more .
And the other thing that we &apos;re going to study is natural selection .
how to change the way the ants communicate --
to increase the efficiency of hunting for _UNK_ .
But one thing I want you to remember is that
is closely related to the size of the _UNK_ .
The simplest explanation is that when a ant is in small _UNK_ --
And of course , the same rule of ants
and I thought , &quot; I &apos;ll get a _UNK_ ant every three seconds . &quot;
But in the small _UNK_ , the ant finds a little chance to hunt for ants ,
It &apos;s only because it &apos;s _UNK_ , so it &apos;s not always going to happen .
So the bigger the _UNK_ are , the older ones are ,
The rules will have different results on the size of the _UNK_ .
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my profession , but my life &apos;s real love and _UNK_ .
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my profession , but my life &apos;s real love and _UNK_ .
I think that this is never going to change .
In spite of my work , there was a special event
I had to _UNK_ the relationship between my work .
This particular thing is that I recently published _UNK_ , pray , love ,
_UNK_ , became a _UNK_ , exciting international book ,
And it turns out , no matter where I go , people feel like I &apos;ve spent my life .
They would be very worried about coming to me and say ,
&quot; Are you afraid ? Are you afraid of your life beyond that book ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not afraid you &apos;ll write this life , but never write about the world ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not afraid you &apos;ll write this life , but never write about the world ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not afraid you &apos;ll write this life , but never write about the world ? &quot;
I was a very lucky day , and I thought that I decided to be a writer
I was a very lucky day , and I thought that I decided to be a writer
I met the same question , and people said , &quot; You &apos;re never going to be successful ?
I met the same question , and people said , &quot; You &apos;re never going to be successful ?
Are you afraid of continuing refuse to _UNK_ you ?
Are you afraid of trying to work for life ?
You will die in a desperate dream , full of _UNK_ .
you end up in a desperate dream , full of _UNK_ .
And the simplest answer to these questions is , &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
In addition to these , I &apos;m afraid a lot of other people can &apos;t imagine
But I &apos;ve been thinking about writing recently , why do I fear writing ?
People are afraid to work for themselves ? Is this logical ?
What is the _UNK_ of creative work so that we are worried about each other &apos;s health ?
What is the _UNK_ of creative work so that we are worried about each other &apos;s health ?
It &apos;s not going to be that other industries , isn &apos;t it ?
For example , my dad was a chemical engineer
In his 40 years of chemical engineering , I remember if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer
In his 40 years of chemical engineering , I remember if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer
No one said , &quot; John , how about the _UNK_ ? &quot;
There &apos;s never been a question of this before .
And of course , _UNK_ , the chemical engineers
And we &apos;re a writer who has such a reputation
Not only writers , the creation of people seem to have a very _UNK_ reputation .
Not only writers , the creation of people seem to have a very _UNK_ reputation .
Just look at the last century , in all the great fields of life ,
Just look at the last century , in all the great fields of life ,
is often a very young man who died of suicide
Even if they don &apos;t commit suicide , they don &apos;t have a complete talent .
Even if they don &apos;t commit suicide , they don &apos;t have a complete talent .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , the last interview in the death , said ,
&quot; Every book I have _UNK_ my part of my book . &quot;
It &apos;s a radical statement about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t see it , because we &apos;ve done it before .
But we don &apos;t see it , because we &apos;ve done it before .
And the idea is that creativity and misery , art creates _UNK_ .
And the idea is that creativity and misery , art creates _UNK_ .
I &apos;d like to ask you today : Are you all _UNK_ about this ?
I &apos;d like to ask you today : Are you all _UNK_ about this ?
Even if I look at this idea , I can &apos;t agree with that .
It &apos;s not only _UNK_ , but scary , I don &apos;t want to continue to the next century .
I think encourage our great creation to continue to live better .
And I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s going to be the dark _UNK_ .
And I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s going to be the dark _UNK_ .
You see , I was young , I was 40 years old .
You see , I was young , I was 40 years old .
I have about 40 years of career in the future .
And it was possible that every piece of work I wrote
would be used to make a _UNK_ with me , isn &apos;t it ?
_UNK_ , for all of us , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about my friends .
And it was possible that my life had been _UNK_
It &apos;s this idea that people set up a big morning of drinking _UNK_ .
It &apos;s this idea that people set up a big morning of drinking _UNK_ .
I want to continue doing my love career , so what should I do ?
And after that , it seems to me that
To continue writing , I have to create a certain psychological protection mechanism
To continue writing , I have to create a certain psychological protection mechanism
I have to build a safe distance in a way
from writing itself , and I &apos;m very _UNK_ about work _UNK_ .
from writing itself , and I &apos;m very _UNK_ about work _UNK_ .
And one year ago , I found a reference model , and I found it in history ,
and see if they are better and more rational
to help art workers to deal with the _UNK_ risk
And the last thing I took to the Greek and Roman Catholic
So , patient asked me to tell me , because at the end of the day ,
people believe that creativity is a sacred _UNK_ .
from a distant and distant place to an artist , with a distant and distant purpose .
The Greeks said that this kind of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
_UNK_ has a similar view that they call the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It &apos;s nice because _UNK_ doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s a very smart person .
They think &quot; _UNK_ &quot; is something extraordinary .
They even think &quot; _UNK_ &quot; in the artist &apos;s studio , like _UNK_ ,
They even think &quot; _UNK_ &quot; in the artist &apos;s studio , like _UNK_ ,
They would _UNK_ out , _UNK_ the artists to create and influence the success
And this is really _UNK_ . This is the safe distance I found
This is the psychological protection mechanism that _UNK_ work .
we can understand how it works , isn &apos;t it ?
The ancient artist was protected by this view and avoid excessive _UNK_ .
If your work is great , it can &apos;t be thanks to you .
because you know that you &apos;re working on a _UNK_ genius ,
If your work is _UNK_ , it &apos;s not your fault .
This is the way the _UNK_ looked at the _UNK_ in the past a long time .
And then the Renaissance , all of them had a great idea :
&quot; Let &apos;s put humanity in the center of the universe , beyond _UNK_ and _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s put humanity in the center of the universe , beyond _UNK_ and _UNK_ . &quot;
So there is no space left to the sacred _UNK_ .
For the first time , people call a _UNK_ , not a genius .
And what I &apos;m going to say is , I think that &apos;s a big mistake .
to give a person , not just a single person ,
to believe that he is the _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ of these things .
to believe that he is the _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ of these things .
_UNK_ asked him to swallow the sun , it was a great responsibility for the fragile individuals .
This _UNK_ a human self - perception and leads to the _UNK_ of personal achievement .
I think that &apos;s the pressure , and there &apos;s a lot of artists
Maybe we should go back to the old past , to give them the idea of human being and creativity ?
We can &apos;t use a very 18 minutes of speech , _UNK_ the human thought of _UNK_ .
The fairy tales follow the artist &apos;s master , _UNK_ the ridiculous idea of _UNK_ water .
Maybe I can &apos;t convince you that all of you agree to me
But what I want to say is , why don &apos;t you think about it ?
in terms of the theory of the human _UNK_ ,
This process , for anyone who has tried to create ,
For example , I &apos;ve seen an outstanding American poet _UNK_ .
She was a poet in the middle of _UNK_
She said to me that she lived in the country in Virginia
She would work in the fields , and suddenly hear and feel a poem , running away from her distance .
Like a _UNK_ , she _UNK_ her down .
She could feel it came because the power would _UNK_ her feet .
She could feel it came because the power would _UNK_ her feet .
Every time she had the only thing she could do ,
And in her words , it &apos;s &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
she would come back home , and the poem would take her all the way .
she would come back home , and the poem would take her all the way .
She needed to find a _UNK_ , so she could catch the poem through her ,
She needed to find a _UNK_ , so she could catch the poem through her ,
She ran hard and didn &apos;t get home , and the poem had been _UNK_ , so she missed the poem .
She ran hard and didn &apos;t get home , and the poem had been _UNK_ , so she missed the poem .
She said the first _UNK_ went through the field , looking for the next poet .
She said that she was almost going to miss a poem .
She ran home and looked for the _UNK_
And the poem is going to cross her and she &apos;s about to walk through it .
and she would come out and grab the tail of the poem .
_UNK_ it back , and the other hand _UNK_ it on paper .
And every time this happens , the _UNK_ is now _UNK_
But only in order , from the final word , until the first word came forward ,
I heard her story , and thought , &quot; That &apos;s incredible . It &apos;s exactly the way I did it !
And of course , it &apos;s not all I do , I &apos;m not a pipe , I &apos;m more like a _UNK_ .
And of course , it &apos;s not all I do , I &apos;m not a pipe , I &apos;m more like a _UNK_ .
I have to get up at the same time , and then get up to work ,
I have to get up at the same time , and then get up to work ,
But even though _UNK_ , I would have an amazing inspiration
And there might be a lot of people sitting there ,
You know , even though I was such a _UNK_ , I would meet the inspiration
How do we see it in a way that we don &apos;t lose sense ?
I know that contemporary artists will deal with the best musicians
A few years ago , I was interviewing him , and we talked about it .
Tom is a typical artist who _UNK_ stress
He told me that one day he was driving in Los Angeles
He told me that one day he was driving in Los Angeles
He was moving forward , suddenly he heard a little beautiful _UNK_ ?
It _UNK_ into his mind , like inspiration came , and _UNK_ .
He wanted to catch it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
He wanted to catch it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
He felt that he was familiar with the idea of creating anxiety
&quot; I &apos;m going to lose this inspiration , and this piece will be _UNK_ to me . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t do that , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
He looked up to the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see me driving ? &quot;
He looked up to the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see me driving ? &quot;
I looked like I could get a piece of music up ?
If you really want to be active in the world , let me get the right time .
It &apos;s not work . His work is still dark .
But when he _UNK_ the genius from himself , he was _UNK_ by serious anxiety .
But when he _UNK_ the genius from himself , he was _UNK_ by serious anxiety .
to create _UNK_ , just to bring pain and trouble , to _UNK_ ,
And he realized that he had no idea that he needed to create _UNK_
It &apos;s an amazing relationship between him and this outside .
This story changed my way of working , and it was saved me
This story changed my way of working , and it was saved me
I was in a state of anxiety when it was written in &quot; Food , _UNK_ , &quot;
I was in a state of anxiety when it was written in &quot; Food , _UNK_ , &quot;
And there was no _UNK_ state of despair
And then you feel that the work will be a complete failure .
to be the most _UNK_ book in the history
Not only _UNK_ , but it was a completely bad _UNK_ , I thought I should give up this book .
Not only _UNK_ , but it was a completely bad _UNK_ , I thought I should give up this book .
And I thought Tom had done something to the sky , and I tried it .
I raised my head from the manuscript to a empty corner in the room .
I raised my head from the manuscript to a empty corner in the room .
&quot; You know , if this book doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s not me , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; Because you can see , I &apos;ve been able to save my entire life . &quot;
&quot; You want this book better , now you &apos;re going to come up and do that part of your job . &quot;
&quot; If you don &apos;t help me , you &apos;ll see your _UNK_ go . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to go back to _UNK_ , because it &apos;s my job . &quot;
I hope today &apos;s history record : I &apos;m _UNK_ my job ,
I hope today &apos;s history record : I &apos;m _UNK_ my job ,
In the North African desert a couple of centuries ago , people will be _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
It took hours of the party until the dawn of the morning
The performance is wonderful because they are all very good actors .
And sometimes , it &apos;s rare , but it &apos;s going to happen .
One of the dancers will be above the present , _UNK_ ,
You should all know what I &apos;m talking about .
because you &apos;ve seen it in a moment , you know ,
It seems to be stopped , and the dancer seems to cross
what he did and 1,000 different shows before .
In _UNK_ , he was no ordinary man , his life _UNK_ from inside ,
In _UNK_ , he was no ordinary man , his life _UNK_ from inside ,
And people knew what this was , and they could _UNK_ it .
They would take _UNK_ , start _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , when Moore &apos;s invasion of Spain , they took this custom .
Now you can still hear this _UNK_ dance
In Spain , when a _UNK_ has done something extraordinary ,
And that was the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
and found that it was Tuesday that he was not a _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s only that _UNK_ is not good , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And he might not be able to reach that height last night .
and maybe no one would show a _UNK_ in his dance .
How do he have to do that ?
This is a very _UNK_ problem . It &apos;s one of the most painful _UNK_ in life .
But maybe we didn &apos;t have to be so painful
If you ever think of the _UNK_ art works completely from you ,
If you ever think of the _UNK_ art works completely from you ,
If you think it &apos;s a magic place , just borrow you a moment , give you a fantastic job .
If you think it &apos;s a magic place , just borrow you a moment , give you a fantastic job .
After you finish the work , you continue to deliver other people
If we look at this problem , everything changes .
In the last few months , I began to look at this .
At the same time , in my next book ,
And what I need to do is tell myself , especially when I &apos;m impatient ,
on your job , whatever your job is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing .
on your job , whatever your job is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing .
If that is in you , the sacred _UNK_ decided to pass through the _UNK_ , even in a short time .
If that is in you , the sacred _UNK_ decided to pass through the _UNK_ , even in a short time .
I believe that we must pass the idea
As long as you are accustomed to _UNK_ , you are worth _UNK_ : _UNK_ !
What we &apos;re talking about is the number revolution .
But I thought that the revolution was over . We became the winner .
We &apos;ve gone through a digital revolution , and now we &apos;re not going to need
I was at MIT with a couple of projects
The first one here , &quot; Internet zero , it &apos;s a network server .
It costs the same as complexity as a RFID label .
It &apos;s just one dollar , that it can be incorporated into every light bulb and a door .
It &apos;s a kind of thing like a _UNK_ code .
You can spread through the way of optical or acoustic .
We can turn this way of opening the Internet .
to the _UNK_ level of the Internet ,
And that &apos;s the next step from here to here .
And then it was the computer of _UNK_
In economics , the _UNK_ goods are the products that can extend and trade .
In other words , the grain value of _UNK_ is only _UNK_ .
But it &apos;s better than half a baby or half a half a computer .
We &apos;re trying to make the computer go into the direction
And you see the back is a prototype .
It comes from a student named Bill _UNK_ , who is now in _UNK_
He thought , why should we make bigger chips
instead of making small chips ? And they put it in a _UNK_ medium .
and let the computer produce it by _UNK_ pounds or _UNK_ ?
on the left is made by the traditional computer .
The one on the right is printed by our first prototype machine .
We &apos;re just producing materials -- no _UNK_ and input _UNK_ .
that kind of stuff is not going to be
It &apos;s not like the point here that it &apos;s very _UNK_ .
The amount of material is double , and it will be double .
If there &apos;s a gun running through its center , there &apos;s nothing to do .
If you need more resources , if you add computer ,
And that &apos;s another step later , and that &apos;s what the raw material is .
These are still traditional numbers , and after this step --
We can combine chemical and computing , and then it &apos;s going to be bubbles .
This is the process of production , which is a display
And you look at this guy and you see
_UNK_ each other , and then _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
We can now _UNK_ the output according to certain rules .
and it can be arranged for information .
This is some slides that I &apos;ve introduced earlier projects . Here &apos;s a quantum way .
all of these things are constantly moving in the lab .
It &apos;s not a metaphor , but it &apos;s really connected with atoms .
We all experienced a digital revolution . But what is that ?
_UNK_ has taken us from here in the early &apos; 50s
from a _UNK_ that _UNK_ the phone line to the Internet today .
And he also suggested that the first important theory
That theory is that if you continue to increase information , and the output of the signal ,
In the &apos; 50s , _UNK_ did the same thing .
He said , you can have a _UNK_ computer , but you can get it to perfect .
This is the last big computer in MIT .
And what we use is the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
After _UNK_ , we had a _UNK_ , and we had a transistor
But all of our manufacturing is done there in this _UNK_ .
A first - class plane that _UNK_ metal into a certain shape .
or to make plastic . One billion billion chips
What it means is the country _UNK_ also _UNK_ --
But the same idea is that the same math
-- _UNK_ and _UNK_ have done that --
I was working with the colleagues at the center of the atom
It was a group of people like me .
I even think it &apos;s going to be
Computer science is the worst science , no matter whether computers or science
It &apos;s basically about the _UNK_ of the technology
But we have to admit that nature is a bigger computer .
You can hear a talk from _UNK_ tomorrow .
So , how can we do that by computational calculations ?
This is a thing he made , and it &apos;s going to be possible
and the material itself will be built by itself .
Like a protein , you can make something like this .
You can do other things . This is 2 D . It &apos;s the same thing .
And the _UNK_ video , this is not a _UNK_ .
And we &apos;ve been doing nine percent of the folds
And we &apos;re going to show you this experiment
by _UNK_ the reliability of the organism .
are all done by the programming of the program .
And even if you could make a house ,
but the code and the _UNK_ of the house .
These are some of the emerging technologies in our lab
but it becomes a tool itself , the output of the program cannot be _UNK_ .
We &apos;re using the taxpayer money to do this , and thank you --
I bought all these machines . We proposed a scientific foundation
_UNK_ , we want to make whatever size it is .
because you don &apos;t have the numbers to be limited
the _UNK_ pressure and the little bit of the system
But the problem is , when we bought these machines ,
I &apos;ve been teaching students how to use these machines .
&quot; How do you make almost anything . We don &apos;t want to do that ,
But the first day of the course was that it looked like this .
And I can give anything to this _UNK_ .
And then _UNK_ asked me , don &apos;t you open this lesson at all ? It seems to be helpful to students .
It &apos;s amazing that these students are not going to work .
They chose this lesson to learn to do things .
By the end of the term , they can fusion their skills
Now you can see a video Kelly is a _UNK_ , this is what she does .
Well , I call Kelly , this is my _UNK_ _UNK_ .
You want to be screaming , but there &apos;s no environmental permission , maybe you &apos;re working
Or you &apos;re in school , or you &apos;re in _UNK_ ,
or in other places where you can &apos;t be screaming ,
OK , I &apos;m going to talk about this _UNK_ _UNK_ is a portable _UNK_ .
when the users scream in their precious times , their _UNK_ break away .
and it &apos;s going to be recorded , you can choose whatever time you want ,
The students _UNK_ a parrot and made a browser
to make a parrot and communicate with other parrot .
to be able to prove that you wake up
This is a device that helps you see your own music ,
This student made a machine that could make machines .
He was able to do it by _UNK_ the block .
This lesson has been a few years , and I finally realized
What the students show is the most _UNK_ thing they make
If these things are available in a horse , you don &apos;t need to build yourself .
Ken said that no one would put computers in their homes
But obviously no one could invent or keep it in a home .
You don &apos;t need to make a computer at home .
because it &apos;s easy to buy it in the market .
You have it , because you want a unique thing , _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
There are 20 million dollars today for the bottom .
20 years later , we can make _UNK_ _UNK_ , which allows us to make whatever we want .
And my students just bought my own machine ,
Today , if you want to spend so much money
because it was government money , and they asked us to do the project ,
In other words , the curriculum took place to school , make a website , and so on .
And so I agreed with the National _UNK_ Foundation .
I said , &quot; Well , we &apos;re not going to say how this project works , but we promise to open the tools
But we &apos;re still building these things . We &apos;ve spent 20,000 dollars in the equipment
It &apos;s the same way to use the entire project .
There &apos;s a laser _UNK_ that can be made into three D .
the symbol of the symbol of the _UNK_ ,
And these are _UNK_ around the world ,
This is a project that has no advance arrangement , but it &apos;s still from Boston .
and in northern Norway , are _UNK_ us
In all these places we can all find _UNK_ computers
In the country , his children were eager to measure and change the world .
but only to get information from the screen
In fact , the gap between manufacturing and tools
It &apos;s not IT , but the technology of IT development
and see the same process -- we don &apos;t think about it in some ways .
to build some _UNK_ -- and now it &apos;s going to be crazy .
We were moved by the passion of the local people .
Because as the building of the _UNK_ , there &apos;s a _UNK_
And you can see that joy in their faces
And this is a girl in Boston ,
She did a _UNK_ design that had to be custom .
from that simple product to some of the needs of _UNK_ .
These are happening in _UNK_ . We started a lab in Ghana
We designed a network sensors that kids would come to the lab
There &apos;s a girl who keeps us up in the middle of the night
That was her first trip to _UNK_ , she was going to do a sensor
and I &apos;m going to work on this stage and learn how to do it .
how to program it , because it was before
She doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s doing or why she &apos;s going to do it .
But she told her that this was what she had to do .
And it was at the time of the night
I think I &apos;m the only person to see her work and she &apos;s amazing .
I &apos;m going to show this engineer to the big company
They said , &quot; Well , the fact that girls do anything better , they can do better .
But they need a lot of people to do , distributed in many different regions .
And it &apos;s like this girl , like this .
My name is _UNK_ , eight years old this year .
and it was just for the entertainment of entertainment .
And then they did some of the real problems .
We learned more about them than we give them .
I took my children to the _UNK_ and let him see what it was doing .
They invented a way to use cardboard cartons to make _UNK_ .
You see here on the screen , now it &apos;s going to be a business .
They designed better design than _UNK_ in MIT .
Now there are three students at MIT doing research .
Last year , I was _UNK_ with some countries , government and tribes
and they all want to do this .
I &apos;ve been saying that we can &apos;t see the most mature thing
And over 20 years , we &apos;re going to see these things are really profound changes .
And then I figured out what was going to happen .
It was a very expensive time and it was hard to use
Now the cost of these _UNK_ _UNK_ and complexity
and it &apos;s not the future . We are now in _UNK_
We talked about the great invention of the time .
At that time , people don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
And we &apos;re here today , and we live in numbers .
And the only question is that it breaks the barrier of people
I visited all the _UNK_ institutions in Washington
In San Francisco , I went to any organization you could imagine
They all want to talk about this , but it &apos;s going to happen .
to break their organization . It &apos;s not allowed to go from law .
The law doesn &apos;t allow individuals to have the power of making things .
And the problem is that it &apos;s so serious
This is the invention of social _UNK_ . In northern Norway ,
where the Arctic is so close to the sky ,
It looks like it &apos;s on the horizon
And the lab came out of the beginning ,
At first they were hoping to find animals in the mountains
But the lab was so fast that they finally decided to build a village ,
It &apos;s not a college , it &apos;s not a company .
It &apos;s basically a _UNK_ village , and it &apos;s a very good guy .
And the thing that happened was that
We now set up a _UNK_ to do this .
and support people to do this , and there &apos;s a _UNK_ fund
We think that those people who work for _UNK_
And as the machines in those labs need to continue ,
It &apos;s a mixture of a _UNK_ loan ,
to the extent of this , and finally , let them go to MIT ,
And I want to conclude the two things
We saw a great change in the field of economic aid
But we still have a _UNK_ principle in technology .
_UNK_ , communications and energy are still in a few companies .
If the head in this room is smart enough
and the information from the _UNK_ Lab
The biggest opportunity is to capture the creation of the world .
to allow people to design and produce _UNK_ to meet local needs .
I thought it was going to happen in _UNK_ .
So the development has broken all of the _UNK_ we can imagine .
The hardest part of the stage is about social thinking .
Finally , the talks about the future of computing technology
And finally , it &apos;s the most favorite version of Moore &apos;s Law .
This is the first picture of the _UNK_ .
We see that over the years of years
the growth and the growth of the world
but eventually there &apos;s a huge _UNK_ of _UNK_
And we &apos;re going to see this little _UNK_
But on the other hand , we &apos;re going to start _UNK_
and it turns out that the final _UNK_
And we &apos;re making this number on the edge of the revolution .
What &apos;s done by the program is that the real world itself
And I didn &apos;t have asked these questions .
is to look at the market of a human being :
And it &apos;s the one that I &apos;ve never seen before .
And this is what I &apos;m going to use
Everybody here is going to go into this machine .
You can choose to go back to the future ,
I guess how you choose recently , I asked my friends a lot of this ,
And they said , &quot; Go back to the past . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand . They said , &quot; You have to go back to the car ,
But I must admit that I am not a group of them .
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , not because I love adventure ,
So , I want to go into this machine and go to the future .
We are the most beautiful times of our time ,
is that at the beginning of a nine digit .
as long as life is going to be .
only a generation of people who have _UNK_ for millions of people
to test and change the process of change .
because we &apos;ve met other problems , and it &apos;s been mentioned a lot of times .
This is still rising and rising speed . It &apos;s enough to make us feel angry .
unless we know how to innovate and innovate ,
The question is , do we do it ? I think we can do it .
I think we can make enough food for billions of people ,
and it doesn &apos;t hurt the land they depend on .
I think we can find the environment friendly energy
I really believe that this theory is absolutely not arbitrary .
but I always met the things that I had to do at night .
This is one of the things that I don &apos;t sleep at night .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
There &apos;s never been a need of technology in human history .
I don &apos;t know what reason , until then I knew it .
who used to _UNK_ my _UNK_ _UNK_
They &apos;re like people in this room in this room .
And then I thought , well , the truth is ,
has been different from the past of the past .
we &apos;re going to talk about progress in _UNK_ .
I think it &apos;s why we know what &apos;s going on .
and we &apos;re going to have a problem now .
You need to accept such evidence , but we don &apos;t know it .
And the reason why I think is that
This kind of _UNK_ and depth is what I never experienced , and I hope it will never occur again .
And 12 years ago , the press had a message ,
So there &apos;s a lot of research going around the event .
It &apos;s really necessary to do these studies because it &apos;s really a serious event .
from the United States and the U.K.
We will believe that we see the eyes , and believe that we see
And I can understand that , I think we all have such psychological psychology .
The United States is the only one in the world .
The amount of _UNK_ is _UNK_ in the country of decline .
Do you see somebody who &apos;s sick and dying ?
But over the last year , there were _UNK_ people who died with _UNK_ .
But it wasn &apos;t happening to us , we could do it anyway ,
And they don &apos;t know what it looks like .
We need to take lessons from it , and the better we are .
because he invented the vaccine that _UNK_ the worst disaster .
He invented _UNK_ vaccine with several other researchers .
This vaccine can save the developing world every year .
It &apos;s great . It &apos;s Paul &apos;s going to talk about this vaccine ,
The name of the United States can be _UNK_ .
They knew where his children were going to school .
I don &apos;t need to talk about this , but the vaccine is really important .
Soon the child died because of this disease , it was just a digital problem .
is not just the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
I wrote a letter to me a couple of weeks ago ,
She said she was not going to give the baby a polio vaccine .
Why ? Because this country has no polio . But do you know ?
Now , I don &apos;t know today , maybe a _UNK_ airplane from the _UNK_ ,
His destination was Los Angeles Airport , and now he was in Ohio .
A few hours later he &apos;ll get to the ground , he &apos;ll take a taxi .
to come here to a dinner dinner at TED .
He didn &apos;t know that he was infected with polio ,
We don &apos;t know , this is the fact of the world .
The fact that our planet is this . Don &apos;t think it &apos;s not .
We like to believe lies . We all love to do that .
The reason you do it is that half Americans do it every day .
They would eat this thing , and they would eat alternatives ,
It &apos;s going to be your urine . They can &apos;t do anything .
If you &apos;d like to take _UNK_ dollars to get some black urine ,
Why are you going to do that ? Why ?
I think I may understand . We &apos;re very large in this country .
And we all hate the big government because we don &apos;t trust .
This is absolutely a very _UNK_ and ruthless medical system .
So we tried to escape the system . Where did we go ?
And I &apos;ve got all kinds of samples here .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ . I don &apos;t even know what this is ,
But we spend billions of _UNK_ to buy them , and this is cheating .
But do you know ? When I talk about it , people would scream for me .
They would say , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ! Let people choose to do it !
And I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know any expert .
or a cancer _UNK_ that wants to pass
You will eventually go to a place where you don &apos;t want to go .
We _UNK_ everything in the stomach , every meal ,
because there was no _UNK_ in the Garden ,
Some experiments are successful , some of them have failed .
And now we can do experiments in a more precise way .
But we can put vitamin A into rice genes ,
Can you think I respond to these _UNK_ ?
And sometimes it &apos;s going to be successful , sometimes failure ,
We need to grow more than we now
This is what we &apos;ve spent the last 30 years in Africa .
The people there need this , but we don &apos;t give it .
to eat _UNK_ foods , such as _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
Those who have improved _UNK_ can avoid blind _UNK_ .
This is a good thing . In spite of the _UNK_ restaurants ,
Please ask yourself : Why are we going to against ?
This is just moving some genome , with addition to chemical materials .
Now we understand the meaning of this process .
If we don &apos;t do that , but stick to what we &apos;re doing ,
we &apos;re going to be because some of the things that we don &apos;t want to happen ,
There is no other words to describe the situation .
You might say , &quot; You walk into this machine ,
We can be sure to set up time machines .
and I want to go there and go there ,
we can actually get to where we really want to go .
We need to do that , we need to think about it ,
And when we go into the machine and we get to the future ,
to build a group of people to create a _UNK_ building .
And although it looks simple , it &apos;s not easy .
And I think this is an interesting idea
And here I &apos;m going to share with you .
They &apos;re talking about _UNK_ , and what &apos;s going to look like .
And then finally , the time is going to be finished .
And then they go back and they go back and forth .
because the weight of the cotton is going to be
They said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s better than the rest of the day .
And the worst of all is the new school school students .
The best of all , is the _UNK_ of the new graduation .
And the structure that they built is the most interesting thing .
because the students in the school are trained
But the truth is that when they put _UNK_ into the top ,
So they &apos;ve been able to _UNK_ the _UNK_ model
So the ability to _UNK_ the _UNK_ is really important .
The average height of most people is 20 feet
The lawyer &apos;s good , but it &apos;s not going to go anywhere .
If you &apos;re in a group of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s incredible , you look around , and you say , &quot; That team will win . &quot;
You know , why do you get a long time ago ?
It &apos;s about six teams that can build upright structure
So I &apos;m going to give you 100,000 dollars to meet the team
Do you guess what the students in the design have ?
even if any group has done a _UNK_ building ,
And then we repeat this activity in the same student .
And so the worst part of the group
They &apos;ve done the maximum building with the minimum time .
is that this is a very simple exercise
And there &apos;s a world record that the world
It requires us to put all our consciousness into the task .
and ask us to use the best thinking
the total amount of oil in the world
If we look at the cost of oil
I dare bet that there will be more than 10 percent
I know there are several air _UNK_ around the world .
Are we smarter than others ? I don &apos;t think that way .
There are five red places on this slide .
There are five _UNK_ in the Middle East
and the rest of the United States
five of them were sent to the past , and these are just coming back .
One day in the United States uses 20 million _UNK_
This is the total amount of oil in the world .
And it needs to take four percent of the population
to see what we do with oil .
Now we look at the world &apos;s largest oil country and the second largest country .
There &apos;s a little bit more planning in China .
And the price of oil is calculated at 100 dollars a barrel .
My friend of Washington last week told me
We all have to pay for the _UNK_
It &apos;s a 130 _UNK_ of _UNK_ from the underground .
and you can use it through the _UNK_ .
And it &apos;s going to be very simple .
You &apos;re going to discover that I &apos;ll tell you later .
It can be replaced or _UNK_ as a _UNK_ .
Look at the bar on the left is _UNK_ .
the estimate of the _UNK_ of _UNK_ --
They claim that they had a _UNK_ of oil
But it doesn &apos;t matter whether they &apos;re right or wrong .
so that you can use _UNK_ trucks
but we have the gas that we have .
Now let me take you -- I was a _UNK_ .
I &apos;m not dead , so I &apos;m going to be here .
We &apos;re going to use our own resources
is going to consume a billion dollars a day .
And then we were investing in the wind industry
The estimate of the natural world is _UNK_ .
We found that water _UNK_ can be used in _UNK_ .
CA : Now you &apos;re a big investor and ready to go into market ?
I &apos;m a _UNK_ who graduated from school
I spent my life in this industry
I &apos;m the second largest natural manufacturer in the United States .
Because you believe that the climate is going to be
_UNK_ : But you have to burn something
CA : No , no doubt that the future fuel
because the CO2 emissions per unit of energy
from coal or oil to the natural world .
I asked you to see how the gas is ?
And he said that it &apos;s going to lead fuel to the future .
_UNK_ , as I said , I don &apos;t worry about it .
I think you &apos;re a _UNK_ for generations .
And you &apos;re a little bit of a _UNK_ .
Do you support the idea of the use of carbon ?
because eventually the government is going to do this project .
I can tell you that this must fail .
I mean , it was doomed to be a bad idea .
And I can tell you that there are
They spend the last page of the nuclear report for five years .
We have to have energy , and this is the _UNK_
So the leakage of methane is going to be solved .
CA : You know that we &apos;re not going to be _UNK_ .
that the hydraulic technology is about 30 years ago ,
I don &apos;t know what he was talking about .
is from the _UNK_ to the boundary of the _UNK_ .
CA : So you don &apos;t support any form of _UNK_
And the world ended up getting rid of the fossil fuels
Is it possible that we will develop solar and nuclear power a day ?
_UNK_ : Jim and I have only met about 13 seconds
And that was a little bit too small .
CA : So how did the world get rid of fossil fuels ?
&quot; It &apos;s not going to be able to use fossil fuels . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be the most clean energy
Why ? The quality of the air is that they use natural gas .
Now , why is all the junk that &apos;s going to happen
I understand what you &apos;re giving me , and I &apos;m not against your ideas .
How are we going to get rid of the gas ?
And the reason why you &apos;re going to join
It might look like part of the solution
But could the greatest benefit for the future of the planet ?
_UNK_ : Well , I &apos;ve lost _UNK_ in the wind
CA : I really thank you very much for coming to this .
I think a lot of people want to communicate with you
It &apos;s really valuable for you to talk to _UNK_ .
It &apos;s very easy to think about _UNK_ and technology .
I know you &apos;re going to meet other speakers .
_UNK_ , it &apos;s easy to adapt to technology .
If we look at the last six years ,
the incredible thing that &apos;s happening in the Internet ,
That would be that even if it was a simple _UNK_ for it .
In many times , how do we decide how to react to things ,
How do you expect the future of the future
So , I think if you can find a _UNK_ to describe the bubble
&quot; The _UNK_ &quot; is the preferred one .
This is a very easy way to understand
There &apos;s no other _UNK_ that look like this .
In the gold rush , people from _UNK_ dollars
And this is a real thing to do .
And the Internet is a completely true thing .
At the same time , the two groups are _UNK_ by _UNK_ .
No , you remember the _UNK_ of the Internet ,
For example , the annual publication of the _UNK_ , a 20 - page cover story shows an attractive prospect .
We looked back at _UNK_ . It was like , &quot; gold , gold , gold , gold . &quot;
At 68 of the _UNK_ steam ship , _UNK_ gold !
and people read this article and it &apos;s going to be very exciting .
The same thing about _UNK_ and the network is still very obvious .
And then the _UNK_ went on for years .
The East Sea , in _UNK_ , when they first heard about it ,
until the news was still there , they were still _UNK_ .
And almost _UNK_ , they thought , &quot; I &apos;m not the most _UNK_ people in the world ,
How don &apos;t you go to California ? &quot; It &apos;s really late .
So , the communities of the East Coast were together
_UNK_ 10 to 20 people across the United States
And those people obviously depend on the power of individuals
But whether it &apos;s a lawyer or a banker , they leave their job
whatever they have , they go to _UNK_ ,
He lived in _UNK_ , and he walked on the _UNK_ route .
They arrived at the _UNK_ and _UNK_ through the _UNK_ .
And the _UNK_ doctor was to go to California
They also have _UNK_ , and they &apos;re doctors and give up _UNK_ .
They &apos;re both very successful , very good , a physician ,
We &apos;ve got these examples on the Web , and we &apos;ve got a _UNK_ website .
In San Francisco , most of the 600 ships were gathered .
because when the ship got there , it was all _UNK_ .
where there was 600 captain and 600 ships
And then the ship became a hotel because there was no _UNK_ , where could the boat go .
If we _UNK_ the passion of network companies , and we had a comparison
And the same thing happened when the Internet was _UNK_ .
In San Francisco , there were soldiers in _UNK_
Half the people are responsible for the sale of gold .
The _UNK_ dare not get half of the people to find them .
One of the soldiers wrote this in their home :
I was struggling with this paradox , and I was going to do the right thing , six dollars a month .
The other side is to do the military , 75 dollars a day .
The use of the hot pan is very serious , very serious .
This is a picture from the gold pan , which is called &quot; white _UNK_ . &quot;
They don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to go .
They put a lot of things to _UNK_ and horses .
And most of the _UNK_ and the horse died in the way
And the Minister of Canada wrote this :
The body of the horse was lying on either side of the road .
There &apos;s even the saddle and the _UNK_ of these _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a lot of goods in the distant journey .
In many times , I had to say that , but I wanted to live .
a fact that we neglect is that in the _UNK_ ,
a lot of the crows in the streets
And this is the _UNK_ of the road .
the experiences of _UNK_ and suffering are difficult to imagine
And although not the smell of the _UNK_ ,
But there &apos;s the same thing on the Internet : _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to give you one of the things that I &apos;m talking about
This is a commercial ad in the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
&#91; Video &#93; _UNK_ : You say you have a lot of options . _UNK_ are .
_UNK_ : Why would she have my invitation ?
_UNK_ : Some small things will lead to the bride : You give me , _UNK_ !
_UNK_ : It may be important for you . A husband : Is that your wife ?
Second husband : 15 minutes later . After all , this is your good day .
_UNK_ website , life is a big thing , published it to the world ,
It &apos;s hard to point out the purpose of this ad
But the company spent about two million dollars
This ad was _UNK_ in the Super Bowl .
Even at that time , the company paid a million dollars a year .
From this incident , we _UNK_ the Internet _UNK_ .
In the end of the gold pan , everything ended .
And here &apos;s a guy wrote , &quot; In _UNK_ , at the time ,
They travel thousands , _UNK_ the risk of living , regardless of health and wealth .
and spent a month in which one can live .
And in the whole process , they had the wonderful expectations
but there &apos;s nothing to find out about it . &quot;
And of course , this is just a very ordinary story .
Because , when you take the last piece of gold ,
This is a very short time . I mean , if you look at _UNK_ --
the entire _UNK_ of the United States , in less than two years --
people _UNK_ every stone . And after that , only those big companies
In addition , there is a good analogy that you feel _UNK_ .
_UNK_ manufacturing industry and the Internet have a lot of _UNK_ .
that the electrical manufacturing industry relates to the scale
-- of course , it &apos;s like the Internet , it &apos;s not very deep .
But it &apos;s a lot of different industries that are related to it .
But the power range is wide , so you have to shrink it .
It can be a way to transmit energy
There &apos;s a lot of interesting things about power ,
And what I &apos;m looking at is the power revolution
to make the world _UNK_ , the most significant device is _UNK_ .
to connect the world with wires to be light .
When people _UNK_ wires , they didn &apos;t think of other electrical appliances
people actually get electricity -- but it took a long time
the middle cost -- as you expect -- big capital to build this network ,
And what this picture shows is that in Manhattan
The _UNK_ are building the first power station .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , later name became the General _UNK_ Company .
It &apos;s very expensive to dig the road out .
But this is not the most similar place in the network ,
And the infrastructure are mainly on the long distance ,
So , all cable and all the _UNK_ infrastructure --
I &apos;m just talking about a part of the development of 1994
In 1994 , how the network industry was going to grow _UNK_ ,
In fact , because of these heavy _UNK_ , large - scale infrastructure have been _UNK_ .
The use of lights led to the _UNK_ of heavy heavy equipment .
And of course , this is very large . The first home electrical fan --
These devices , these devices , the boom of the machines --
And of course it depends on how you measure it --
about 40 to 60 years . This is a very long period
It &apos;s about _UNK_ , and the fan is a great success .
By the way , this is also about the beginning of _UNK_ _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) .
This is the first vacuum cleaner , the _UNK_ vacuum cleaner .
It &apos;s made by _UNK_ , 99 pounds of _UNK_
You need two people to operate , and it &apos;s about a quarter of the cost of a car .
only three years later , that weight is reduced to 40 pounds .
It &apos;s a power tie , it &apos;s not going to pop up .
I guess people don &apos;t have a tie to them .
A special electric heating for shoes and selling _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s for , but you might think that way
It &apos;s not at any time to make some invent
Maybe it &apos;s the best time to _UNK_ this invention .
So we can start a ad that will play
We need the right partner , and I think --
I think it &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s worth _UNK_ .
because people usually make bread in the wild .
It takes a lot of time and energy
I want to point out that this is , you know what this is .
And remember , when people were not using electricity ,
They &apos;re for lighting . So you can use your electrical appliances
and people put a light _UNK_ on the ceiling of each room .
If you haven &apos;t seen the _UNK_ of Disney World ,
You &apos;ve got to see this . These are the wires that connect the light .
all electrical appliances are on it . You need to do that .
The washing machine is the next very successful example
And this is a kind of envy and desires .
The one on the left is the _UNK_
There &apos;s a rotor that is a _UNK_ motor
This is a clean water . You can take the clothes out here .
put it here , and put it through this _UNK_ ,
you put it on your _UNK_ because it &apos;s _UNK_ and it &apos;s annoying .
You have to _UNK_ a very long wire to your house .
so that you can tie it to the _UNK_
And this is actually an important point in my introduction .
And the invention of electrical switches is much more late than that .
I mean , people don &apos;t want to have anything to _UNK_ the light base .
And when people don &apos;t want to use light bulb , it &apos;s going to _UNK_ it .
This is what people did at the time , actually didn &apos;t turn it off .
And as I did , people didn &apos;t go to _UNK_ ,
So the washing machine is a very dangerous device
For example , people would _UNK_ their hair and clothes together .
because the power plug is tightly _UNK_ in the room
And it doesn &apos;t have a switch on the washing machine , it &apos;s a little _UNK_ .
You might think our _UNK_ is a silly thing .
and it &apos;s going to take electrical appliances like this .
But before I talk too much about _UNK_ our _UNK_ ,
I think I &apos;m going to show you this : this is my conference room .
And this is absolutely a _UNK_ computer
First of all , it was _UNK_ . This is a _UNK_ --
And the wire always goes out , so I put it on it ,
so I don &apos;t have to connect the wires , but it &apos;s not the worst .
And this is the case of my desk .
In fact , we have no great progress since _UNK_
is that this process is very _UNK_ , absolutely painful .
The premise is that you have _UNK_ in your home
The engineers who do this every day don &apos;t do it .
They sometimes have to go back and forth
a friend of mine once told me a story
not just after the workers come there , but wait .
And the final engineer came to the place
And the third time , engineers had to call for help .
The workers were happy because the engineer had a _UNK_ call
so that they can wait for another hour .
and to communicate with another dial and tell them the code
And that means that the design of _UNK_
We are very primitive , and this is the key .
Because , you know , elastic -- if you think about it as a _UNK_ ,
because the last piece of gold will disappear .
But it &apos;s worth that , by innovation , the gold will be _UNK_ .
_UNK_ created two new problems and created two new opportunities .
If you believe it , then you can see our situation
And that &apos;s my point : I love the kind of _UNK_ environment
I didn &apos;t even mention the Internet interface ,
But there are so many _UNK_ machines that are so awful things
The development of the Internet is the same as the _UNK_ machine .
This is our situation . We don &apos;t have hair to break into the washing machine .
But this is what we are in the original level .
If you believe what I say , it &apos;s not going to hurt you . It &apos;s the news of 1996 :
&quot; All negative news is accumulated and it makes us feel that there is no value in the network . &quot;
But if you think it &apos;s true , that &apos;s the _UNK_
And one starts , if you look at the Internet as a _UNK_ machine ,
you think it &apos;s very hopeful . And I &apos;m looking at the Internet
I believe that the future we can create innovation
_UNK_ , at that time . I hope that the mistake is wrong .
This is a ad that was _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a saying , &quot; Don &apos;t just use electric illumination . &quot;
Maybe some of you have a _UNK_ in your hand .
I &apos;ve written a book called &quot; How architecture is learning . &quot;
Let &apos;s talk about the background : the last 10 years , I &apos;ve been wondering
to _UNK_ the human civilization that we could have a long thought
to make such a _UNK_ , rather than that difficult or no thought .
If we can make the habits of long thought , it will be _UNK_ .
That means that this week or next quarter
but for the next 10,000 years and the past ,
And the Foundation was in San Francisco for a long time .
These are projects that are related to long term thinking .
And our core project is a very large _UNK_ project .
You can say it &apos;s a _UNK_ project , it &apos;s about to build a _UNK_ clock .
And one can be a very good _UNK_
And the design of a plan is also very glamorous .
All right , I &apos;ll go back to this clock .
is designed by Danny _UNK_ and _UNK_ , which is now in London .
and walked quietly in the Museum of Science .
So the problem that we face today is that
how _UNK_ is so good as being put on a clock .
that will work within 10,000 years and accurately ?
And the idea is that it looks good .
And once you think about the destruction of a building ,
Look , this is the destruction of the building .
This is _UNK_ , and it &apos;s only about _UNK_ years ago .
It &apos;s a pretty beautiful project that it can be forever .
because they were built with a giant rock ,
Now , you see a bunch of _UNK_ and no one knew it was used as a _UNK_ .
For example , the pyramid of the city has been _UNK_ .
These buildings were used to preserve things , but they actually did it .
So we thought that if you could put things in the building ,
Where is the good store ? We want to put it in the ground ?
The answer is obvious that we need to find a mountain
It &apos;s only that time you can hold a _UNK_ clock
So we met the _UNK_ of the right place .
In many ways , we thought that it must be a mountain in the desert .
So we went to the _UNK_ of the United States
At this time , Roger Kennedy found us
there &apos;s the highest place in the state , and there &apos;s _UNK_ .
You see , on the left , there &apos;s a steep steep _UNK_ there .
This is a pretty remote place , 200 miles away from the nearest city .
And there &apos;s only one of these things called
In this yellow line , on the right is national park .
on the left is the _UNK_ _UNK_ and other private _UNK_ .
And there was just a narrow gap between the two miles .
This _UNK_ is a private territory , it can transfer
Thank Jay Walker and _UNK_ , and they &apos;re both here today .
This is under their support , we got this project and bought it .
Well , let &apos;s see what &apos;s going to be there .
We &apos;re on the top of the _UNK_ , the west is the cliff of Washington .
And the top peak there is _UNK_ _UNK_
It should be a good choice to hide a clock .
People are going to go there , like _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Last June , the _UNK_ Board , some staff and _UNK_
It took two weeks to look at it .
One is to know whether it &apos;s right to be there .
If it &apos;s right , we can do this particular project ,
He proposed a theory to explain how this mysterious _UNK_ process is .
And he said , this process includes seven steps
The first is a image , which is the image in your mind ,
And you imagine yourself had to do this journey ,
Maybe the end of the journey is a clock waiting for you .
And then I came out , and this is the beginning of the journey .
from the normal life to the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
And then you go into the Maze -- it &apos;s pretty glamorous .
The Maze is a concept , like a _UNK_ zone .
It &apos;s hard to get out of it , and you get lost .
and even _UNK_ -- but you have to go through
If you &apos;re going to get a kind of deep fusion ,
And then you &apos;re going to be able to see
like a _UNK_ , showing you through the Maze ,
musicians Brian _UNK_ -- he was involved in this project
It took two years to make a CD for _UNK_
&quot; The Bell Research of the human _UNK_
And part of it was made by Danny _UNK_ .
that every day in 10,000 years of time ,
The _UNK_ algorithm can be achieved by the index 10 .
And we can hear the sound right now .
The fifth thing is that it &apos;s the most exciting time
You go to the end , and you get to where you want to go .
Danny said that a great journey should have a mysterious harvest .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
you &apos;re going to go back to the normal world ,
that you get slowly to digest what you &apos;re learning .
It might be a bit of a drill
What is the best way to influence your thoughts and decision ?
We start with the boundary , if you look at the left side of the cliff ,
This one can &apos;t run , on the right is the forest of the country .
And there &apos;s a special _UNK_ . You see what &apos;s going on on the top of the mountain .
In fact , the _UNK_ mountains in Washington are covered with ancient _UNK_ .
They thought they had only been _UNK_ , but it wasn &apos;t .
The trees on the mountain have been _UNK_ , and it &apos;s still _UNK_ .
The wood of this tree is so strong that it has been a long time
If you test the growth ring on the mountain ,
because they &apos;ve gone through the _UNK_ of wind
The _UNK_ has done a _UNK_ test on the tree there .
Well , if you have a _UNK_ in your hand ,
It can be held with its hands , especially at the top .
You can see why it &apos;s called _UNK_ , you can feel
This is Danny , and it &apos;s in a _UNK_ .
On the land of the _UNK_ , I should mention the _UNK_
He was studying these trees in high pressure
At last , a article published in the journal Science magazine .
He started working on this theory and studied around the world
He found that the tree in White was about _UNK_ .
&quot; _UNK_ &quot; itself is a very interesting design rule .
Well , let &apos;s see the mine again . In the first place ,
When we first went to see in 1998 , there was a billion dollars to buy 180 acres and a small mine
because the owner of land says that there &apos;s a billion billion dollars in the field
We said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s great -- can we buy it for _UNK_ ? &quot;
We &apos;re a nonprofit foundation that you can give us directly .
If you can tell the government that it &apos;s worth a billion dollars ,
And over a few years , we have some _UNK_
And finally , in _UNK_ and Jay help ,
And we finally bought this piece of paper
This is a mine , and there &apos;s no _UNK_ in it .
It &apos;s called _UNK_ , and it &apos;s got _UNK_ in it .
But it &apos;s just a little bit back . It &apos;s what it looks like .
It has a _UNK_ line of about a mile .
to the east , there &apos;s a very interesting place
We &apos;re going to go inside and you can see it .
And I want to see _UNK_ , but it &apos;s just going to be _UNK_ .
A strong rock is not needed to support any _UNK_ there .
Some of the parts of it are deep into the cave .
This is Ben _UNK_ , who is the expert in National Park .
There &apos;s a lot of wonderful things like this fungi .
This is another mine , and it &apos;s on the hill .
And that was the first time in _UNK_ land
A lot of mine projects are starting here , and that &apos;s a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
In fact , it was the highest work mine in Nevada .
You can imagine what happened in the winter of 10,000 feet .
You may know a few _UNK_ in the mine
Right side is Jeff _UNK_ on the left , and they &apos;re looking for _UNK_ .
but you don &apos;t have any kind of _UNK_
They work every day , and this is the last mine .
It &apos;s called _UNK_ , which is under the _UNK_ .
On the left side , Rose , who was in the national park
in the middle of the mine , there was a mile deep .
And they found four different kinds of bats
Now , almost all of these mines are under the _UNK_ ,
This is something that is worth thinking about .
Look at the weather . The weather is very special .
Last June , a Tuesday , we were there
wake up in the morning and the snow was _UNK_ .
The day we went to the top of the mountain to see our climate standing all over , and it was great .
This woman on the left is Pat _UNK_ .
She was the head of the National Forest Service .
They allow us to use that piece of paper
We want to get a _UNK_ of land
and it &apos;s driven by solar energy , and the data is sent
The signal is _UNK_ back through the horizon .
at the center of _UNK_ to the signal .
In that context , we announced real time data on the Internet
So you can see it &apos;s going to be happening in Washington &apos;s first week
The truth is that there is no point to Washington
But there was no bear , there was no poison trees .
No one , because the people here have been _UNK_
You might have gone for a few days and never met a person .
It &apos;s beautiful that around the cliff is _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a shortcut to the bottom of the _UNK_ .
But when you came here , you met a problem .
You can choose from _UNK_ Lincoln as a path .
Another possibility is that the west of the mountain
And you can understand why we call a long mountain range .
and standing on the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
It &apos;s easy to go to _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ .
is a hill that &apos;s been _UNK_ by _UNK_ feet .
you can continue to walk along the grass .
And after a _UNK_ came up to the top of the cliff ,
Jeff is going to leave us with this _UNK_ ,
The more difficult it gets , the more people hold it . &quot;
Well , look here -- this is 600 feet tall , _UNK_ .
He started off the _UNK_ of his truck
But we know that the higher level of IQ will fall .
He could not calculate the degree of his brain
I was in the radio with _UNK_ _UNK_ .
When he got to the cliff , he said ,
&quot; There &apos;s a hidden _UNK_ , I think I can go there . &quot;
He climbing , and it &apos;s also our project director .
I don &apos;t want him to die because I know he loves that movement .
And he went on , and I heard it later .
&quot; I climbed half the distance , almost nothing to climb a _UNK_ , I was still under 60 degrees &apos; ? &quot;
Here is a secret channel , like _UNK_ &apos;s novels .
And what I &apos;m going to hear is that
&quot; I got to the top of the mountain , and here you can see all the things that are good ! &quot;
And he was in the top of the mountain
He was the first to go to Washington in _UNK_
And it &apos;s completely changing the way we think about the cliff .
We think it &apos;s necessary to give the _UNK_
the gap -- if you get a _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s a very beautiful , very beautiful zone that leads to _UNK_
The name is _UNK_ , and this is what it is .
It &apos;s really hidden , and it doesn &apos;t look at the map .
It &apos;s only when you wait for the _UNK_ , you &apos;ll see this gap .
One day , Danny and I went to the same place
And there &apos;s _UNK_ , there are some ancient _UNK_
Imagine if someone &apos;s looking for a thousand years
They may come here , and they &apos;re drawn to the _UNK_ .
the people at the top of the mountain can see them .
These little people look there , and they &apos;re _UNK_ .
How do they go there ? I &apos;m not going to do that ?
That might be one of the most appealing and _UNK_
_UNK_ around the south , and look at the entire _UNK_
You know , Danny &apos;s clock is about to _UNK_ on time .
And it depends on the sun at noon
so hot enough to drive a solar system
That device will _UNK_ the time and make the time completely right .
So even though the Earth is spinning faster ,
This is a photograph from the south , from the north ,
Here &apos;s the _UNK_ . If you go to the top of the cliff ,
you see the _UNK_ Foundation in the forest
If you go up again , look back , you &apos;ll see
&quot; The feeling of the mountain &quot; _UNK_ &quot;
This is a long distance . Here &apos;s a mile away from the horizon .
And this is where the _UNK_ here is actually bush .
It &apos;s not the same place . It &apos;s a very spectacular view .
If you look at the right side of this graph , especially on the edge of the cliff ,
It &apos;s 600 feet high , on the left side of the _UNK_ leg ,
And 600 feet fall down , and he &apos;s gradually moving over the cracks .
I think we should put a fence or something like that .
The _UNK_ of the mountain is relatively weak .
Notice that it &apos;s not snow , but white _UNK_ .
They &apos;ve been a good one here , but it &apos;s in a difficult position .
Danny is looking for the answer to a design problem .
And he thought that it was not a long foundation ,
It looks like the top of the _UNK_
because the real top is in a hidden corner .
We used to call the _UNK_ in the troops
The answer to this question is that it is certain
from the _UNK_ , and this one is still _UNK_ .
So we &apos;ve met three design challenges here .
The third is from the experience of the mountain
And if you look at the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
You can see that there are 10 farms
You can even see the underground water coming out ?
One of the farms called the _UNK_ farm
_UNK_ can see _UNK_ and cows are run by Paul and _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a lot of farms that are _UNK_ .
This is a view of the _UNK_ on the farm .
If you go away from the distance ,
and see how the _UNK_ were in the past .
This is the Chinese _UNK_ , and they &apos;ve been there for thousands of years .
The Foundation is considering whether it might be bought
And the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_
is covered with 500 _UNK_ of mining _UNK_ .
We think there might be _UNK_ dollars to buy this whole block .
and then make it go back to the form .
In the right time , it changes into national parks .
so that the area of national parks increases . That &apos;s too _UNK_ .
Well , let &apos;s look at the big mountain .
At the bottom of the cliff there was a natural cave
It &apos;s only 12 feet deep , but is it _UNK_ ?
You can go out and go to a cave , and then you go to _UNK_ .
At the beginning , it was very simple .
but it &apos;s going to be more smooth . It &apos;s more beautiful .
You have to go through a lot of _UNK_
This is not a mine , this is a _UNK_ ghost ,
And in this sense , your love is never in the face of the mountain .
And it &apos;s also a mystery that _UNK_ _UNK_
What we did is we _UNK_ the spectacular part and _UNK_
It &apos;s not a big clock , but it &apos;s a _UNK_ clock .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , the _UNK_ of the Native American Indians :
You should consider the future of the long term ,
The Native American texts are &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ &quot; -- welcome to _UNK_ .
And I &apos;ve had to sleep less than that .
as a very good virtue , for years ,
The thought was fighting because I once thought sleep was poor and healthy .
And now I love sitting in a certain way , you know .
I think maybe my creativity is _UNK_ by this _UNK_ .
I am sober , I consider all kinds of thoughts , and I walk for a walk .
and walking in the daytime and follow those interesting people .
And sometimes -- in fact , the sixth page of the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s like looking at this guy , whatever it is ,
And the real reason I follow him is he &apos;s wearing a really nice pair of shoes .
and holding their hands and then walked all over them .
In fact , I think a lot of my design concepts
because I think , you know , there &apos;s a lot of pictures everywhere .
And the only ones that I &apos;m interested in
is that it looks a little wrong , of course ,
to see a hole in the shirt , or something else ,
I &apos;ve never seen before in a certain sense .
So I let the car stop , and then I walked ,
and found that there was no holes , but only the illusion of the eye ,
I think it &apos;s a hole , and it &apos;s over ,
has been thought of the idea of this idea .
I can &apos;t do that again , someone has already been wrong .
In fact , one of the most funny things
is the _UNK_ of New York City during Christmas .
I read _UNK_ and _UNK_ in a perfect band .
You know , I read it like a _UNK_ .
And I found that the most intelligent critic I love
This woman is _UNK_ , a friend of mine ,
Oh , you know , _UNK_ , you know ? You know , _UNK_ ,
And you know , you know , about _UNK_ Russia .
I said , how could I be to _UNK_ ?
I know , a wolf and a bird , you know ,
He ate the bird , and then you hear , you know ,
You hear the _UNK_ , or whatever else , you know ?
So I &apos;m not quite sure that , it &apos;s not really clear --
I &apos;m going to do my own unique research , you know ,
If I were to make clothing for the _UNK_ of the 18th century ,
I &apos;m going to do a lot of research because it &apos;s interesting ,
the color and the light _UNK_ in the film ,
or from the light of the _UNK_ itself to make these colors look like this .
Anyway , let &apos;s take this little clip , give you a look at it ,
I sat down at night looking at the film ,
and you &apos;re going to try to look at your daughter &apos;s film .
because I &apos;m always going to look at women .
Or , you know , they are _UNK_ praise for them .
Or , you know , in some degree , _UNK_ , or _UNK_ .
So that &apos;s what I did . I did a lot of research on color .
But most of the time , I think , it seems that I can make
What kind of beautiful thing like _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
How could I make such a beautiful thing about _UNK_ ?
So that &apos;s why I don &apos;t sleep at night , I guess you know .
I want to show you -- I think a big one --
I always go to the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
And that &apos;s another thing that inspired me .
People say , oh , do that . And _UNK_ told me something about it .
When I was 21 , a _UNK_ told me
I &apos;m going to meet the men I &apos;m _UNK_ ,
And his name will be _UNK_ , isn &apos;t it ?
So , you know , a lot of years I should go to the bar
And then I met anybody named _UNK_ _UNK_
And sometimes I was in a desperate situation
I &apos;m going to , you know , go into a room and call &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
And anyone who looks back , I &apos;m almost going to go .
A long time ago I had this interesting experience
And he came out and said , &quot; My destiny . &quot;
and draw a straw hat , with a _UNK_ ,
with something like a shoe , like a _UNK_ poet .
I &apos;d like to show you a film because I was playing a dance show
&#91; Video : Thank you . &#93; We can do everything you need .
The name of the show is from this story ,
is about my mother , to talk to you about it .
And in a way , it &apos;s like what she said .
just because he was happy with him , I swear .
I was dealing with him for almost a year .
So we decided to ask our parents to have dinner together .
We &apos;re going to introduce them to each other .
My mother was a bit too sensitive to his mother .
His mother _UNK_ about the whole non - mainstream lifestyle .
So my mother felt _UNK_ . She went to her and said ,
&quot; Are you _UNK_ ? They &apos;re a natural one .
This is the name of the show . They go to dinner together --
I didn &apos;t have such a _UNK_ when I started this film .
to cut my clip out in the _UNK_ bar .
So you might have to look at my performance
I think the more _UNK_ is a good thing .
Because if I &apos;ve been doing the same thing ,
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;ll be very boring . I &apos;m easy to be bored .
I &apos;m not saying that I can do everything .
I just say I &apos;ll do a lot of things , just that .
I &apos;m going to try to look at the earlier things .
Unless . I guess , I &apos;m not going to sleep for that ,
Like , look back and thinking , you make yourself so _UNK_ .
I began to make _UNK_ when I was a kid .
Maybe that &apos;s where I started , the _UNK_ _UNK_ !
I didn &apos;t know how to design it at the time .
And then I started my career as a designer .
I don &apos;t think that myself is a designer .
and I don &apos;t think I &apos;m a fashion designer .
_UNK_ , I don &apos;t know how to call myself .
I feel myself . I don &apos;t know what I think I &apos;m doing .
But I have to say that it &apos;s always a little boring thing ,
I think that &apos;s a very important thing for fashion designers .
You should be going to be a bit _UNK_ about everything .
If you &apos;re not , it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ to every thing .
But I really felt a little bit _UNK_ about everything .
I always say to my partner -- Mary _UNK_ , she &apos;ll arrange all the things --
And I always said to her , and I found out
and spent a lot of time playing a bridge
It took a lot of time in the computer bridge , like ,
I think that the world is _UNK_ ,
to make a show every day , like some _UNK_ .
because it &apos;s something that I like to do ,
And if you &apos;re bored , you can go to something else ,
to do something else , talk about it , right ?
It was a very , very important part of my life .
This is one of my favorites in my film .
_UNK_ : Look at how cute she looks like a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : Ah , _UNK_ , delicious . Okay , what are I going to sit ?
I don &apos;t think -- well , we &apos;re going to start .
I cut my head never once more nervous .
And you &apos;ve got a very cute thing .
You don &apos;t want to look cute ? You want to look cute .
_UNK_ : Just make sure that some people want to look like ,
_UNK_ : You will read some reports about the rich people .
They have children , but these kids always end up ,
There &apos;s always a solution to solving that ,
because you &apos;re wealthy , you &apos;re famous , you know ,
because you know that their life might be _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ : No , but that means you want to
but you need to make a decision for yourself .
They would not have been able to get drugs in 14 years .
Oh , this is the first time I cut .
A : I &apos;m going to ask you , your hair --
_UNK_ : I think it needs to be a little bit .
_UNK_ : Are you afraid ? You look too cute .
_UNK_ : No , I like this , this is a new one .
So , it &apos;s all kind of boring things .
I mean , like some of you had already been cute .
That &apos;s not boring . What &apos;s interesting about it ?
And one day I read a good word , and I said ,
_UNK_ makes it great because it _UNK_ you to die . &quot;
Right ? And then I found that it was my website ,
It was written above , and it was what I said .
And I thought , ah , I said something about this when I was interviewing .
I forgot to say those words , but that was true .
I &apos;d like to show you the last film , to meet it .
I tell you I often cook , I like cooking .
I often compare a lot of things to food .
For example , I said , oh , would you call the _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
How do you go to service , wearing a _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
How can you wear a _UNK_ of _UNK_ ?
And I think this is the final conclusion .
It &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing , and I think this is the most interesting thing in the world .
There &apos;s a lot of different things on it .
It &apos;s the most interesting thing in the world .
It &apos;s about the beginning of February . Who knows it ?
And again , I didn &apos;t say that well , I just said it was _UNK_ .
Video : _UNK_ : Tell you , I often make butter _UNK_ or butter .
_UNK_ : Yes , but I never found butter , never had ever been .
_UNK_ : You can &apos;t find butter in the _UNK_ , you can &apos;t find it .
_UNK_ : Oh , you &apos;re not there ? I &apos;ll tell you .
_UNK_ : Don &apos;t laugh , it &apos;s not funny at all .
I know I don &apos;t know what the butter butter is .
_UNK_ : Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about .
when they did the butter before they did it ,
_UNK_ : _UNK_ the cream of the _UNK_ ,
and then _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_
It was a long time ago to do it .
that can be used to do things and everything else .
Now , the butter you buy is actually low fat or _UNK_ milk .
_UNK_ : He thought it was because butter was very thick .
It &apos;s nice to be here at TED , and I love it .
why _UNK_ is becoming more powerful in most countries in Muslim countries .
or &quot; How can we do better than we do ? &quot;
that led me to the stage of TED today ,
what was going to happen in the world .
I want to share with you a story
And there &apos;s also a role in creating this change
At the beginning , I &apos;d like to introduce the next very short history
And then we came to a period of the 19 th century ,
This new era is known as the New York Times .
These are not _UNK_ , _UNK_ people &apos;s ideas and stories .
the people who really use this behavior ,
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
and I see how it affects my family .
I mean , by the way , I &apos;m a _UNK_ .
When I was 17 years old , I was in Cambridge
I became the leader of this organization in Britain .
When I was 21 years old , I founded this organization in Pakistan .
As a political prisoner was _UNK_ for five years .
and I walked through the world in _UNK_ --
By the way , we were _UNK_ at the time of democracy .
And we thought they were coming from the past .
So , as I say , we look at the status
It &apos;s not just the Islamic _UNK_ doing this .
If you look at the _UNK_ of Europe ,
In other countries , the _UNK_ of religion is _UNK_ ,
that people in these regions are connected to
This connection makes them feel they &apos;re actually the dominant .
to make it feel part of the mass phenomenon .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of this .
I don &apos;t know if you remember the Christmas _UNK_ :
The Nigeria students in London , in the training of _UNK_ ,
by the father of this student , the _UNK_ Bank ,
He _UNK_ that his son was going to attack
We need to understand the power of social movement
And in my opinion , a social movement contains
This is an example of all of you in this room ,
If I want you to think about the concept of an organization ,
If I let you think about the name and the reason --
Western countries fight against Islamic nations , need to defend Islam , against the west --
The idea is that a person believes this organization ;
And the reason why _UNK_ is a sales pitch --
The concept and stories of the base are soon emerging in your mind .
If I ask them what they call and their leaders ,
One of their leaders recently killed in Pakistan .
They have no borders , and they have concepts and names ,
If I let you focus on the attention of Pakistan ,
One of the problems that we &apos;re facing is , in my opinion ,
In the _UNK_ society , there is no horror tissue , there is no _UNK_ ,
There is no concept , name , leadership , and symbol
whether it &apos;s extremely _UNK_ , or Islamic _UNK_ --
that other people in the society --
They don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a culture .
We believe that the values that we have --
_UNK_ culture is the best thing we do .
But there will be other parties to vote for them .
And people would say , &quot; We &apos;re trying to democracy , it &apos;s not for us . &quot;
On this slide I call it a sense of resistance .
In contrast , the world &apos;s power is the United States ,
that makes democracy more and more difficult .
Most people in the extreme molecular tissue have high education .
_UNK_ Laden is one of the richest countries in Saudi Arabia .
In the last few years , international aid and development are continuing ,
But the _UNK_ of the society in these societies ,
It &apos;s not independence , but it &apos;s the same thing .
is the real demand for the _UNK_ of democracy .
_UNK_ to build their demand for the _UNK_ thought .
They &apos;ve been trying to build the needs of their thinking system .
But there is no free speech , there is no free election .
No human rights , you don &apos;t have a campaign safety .
So what we need is that those organizations
so that in these areas the need for this culture .
to avoid the problems that I talked about earlier ,
But if we could build this demand from civilization ,
is the ideal thing you can see on this slide .
a place where people can vote in democracy
but certainly not the _UNK_ and the military _UNK_ --
This democracy is not just one of the options in the _UNK_ box .
The Arab _UNK_ confirmed that all of this had begun .
But what happened in the Arab _UNK_ and Egypt
We need to take further action now .
We need to understand how to help those social
So when Arab _UNK_ rose in Egypt , _UNK_ across the area .
In the _UNK_ and &apos; 90s , when Islam rose in that region ,
and went through the Middle East and North America .
And what we &apos;re looking for now is --
It &apos;s not just about being _UNK_ --
in the _UNK_ of the world around us .
We &apos;ve been starting to do it from Pakistan .
where we &apos;re going to encourage young people
So today , thank you for all of you .
I &apos;m going to talk about the media prospects in change ,
Now people can use the medium of media
And I passed some stories about this change ,
First of all , the United States elections in November last year .
You may read some news in the newspaper .
and it &apos;s going to happen in the United States .
There &apos;s a plan for video video video _UNK_ .
Every citizen has a photo and a _UNK_ cell
to _UNK_ any votes for the competition of voting .
This is a _UNK_ action that looks at the _UNK_ type .
The citizens are not only the exercise of individual citizens .
and help make sure that the entire election is sacred .
It also makes sure that we must play the form of election together .
It &apos;s not going to wait until the new technology is shining ,
but every person starts to realize that this is necessary .
People can afford to think that we are all in it .
So we &apos;re starting to see the media prospects .
And we don &apos;t have to do it more ,
in the history of the developing world , in life ,
Now there &apos;s a big request . I &apos;ll show you .
There are at least four stages of the past .
There is a big change in the media , with the logo of the product .
The first one is famous , the medium is published .
_UNK_ , ink , the innovation of innovation ,
In the 15 th century , the _UNK_ began to change Europe from _UNK_ .
In addition to printing , there is a change in the media .
And the last 100 years ago , the electromagnetic spectrum
_UNK_ through air , tape recorder , television transmission sound and view .
This is the media of the 20th century .
that we have a certain age of growth and experiences
and you &apos;re going to talk to another person .
If you want to build a organization , you get the same information
and you pass every person in the tissue .
No matter what you do with the radio agency or publishing publishing .
It looks like the top of the glass .
The media is a kind of natural support for the conversation .
The magazine went to the Web . The film went to the network .
The media are rapidly reduced to some of the news .
He was more _UNK_ to coordinate the website .
because the tissue saw , heard , was seen to listen to something
Now you can go together and communicate with each other .
A member of the audience , as Dan _UNK_ called them ,
It &apos;s like , when you buy a book , they &apos;re free to print it .
When you push the button , you change your cell phone
Although some organizations know how to cope with the network .
There is a terrible destruction in the Richter scale .
In the event of the earthquake , the _UNK_ was reported .
People use mobile phones . People take pictures of buildings .
to the largest network service in China ,
Other countries are opening up _UNK_ in China .
people across the world know the news .
The BBC received the first news of the Sichuan earthquake .
The _UNK_ earthquake happened in the last time in China .
The government took three months to admit of earthquake events .
Now they have a chance to do that ,
because they were _UNK_ about the news of their citizens .
Even the government understood the earthquake from their citizens .
There are nine links that are all about earthquake .
_UNK_ like a cat on the _UNK_ , but that &apos;s for your network .
10 of the first nine of them .
There is a net of 100 billion dollars .
There is a net of 100 billion dollars .
There is a net of 100 billion dollars .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
and decided that it would be open .
a local official _UNK_ the crowd in the streets .
And basically , &quot; We &apos;ll fix everything out of it ,
Some people see the death of a single child
They began to _UNK_ the media they had built .
using some of the most widely known as Chinese _UNK_ .
The Chinese government can filter it and then the media into China .
And the Chinese firewall is going to be
because in the present four features are all _UNK_ .
because of the _UNK_ and _UNK_ of media ,
The media quickly formed , creating an incredible rich content .
The government has no way to filter the media already released .
So now the Chinese government , for 20 years ,
And now I &apos;m going to decide that
It &apos;s so big that you can &apos;t find a good way to solve it .
They have already closed the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not going to be able to filter it .
Now these changes are not just people who affect information .
He also influenced the people who passed information .
This is actually a _UNK_ into a ecosystems .
to a member of a network group of people .
_UNK_ information . _UNK_ the same information to everyone .
We &apos;re going to go through a future of media globalization .
Most of the organizations are starting to release information
to the outside world , to bring public attention ,
It &apos;s a little strange . But you &apos;ve been accustomed to it , as people do it .
We live in it , but it &apos;s not a crazy change .
In fact , there is no _UNK_ between each other .
The public can communicate directly with another public .
there are more amateur media than professionals .
is actually the number of people who are _UNK_ .
that most of the media in the public
Now is the source of green information , free content .
I &apos;m not talking about the _UNK_ application of politics .
Obama has done one of the things that are famous ,
In the Obama campaign , they built a famous one .
to try and figure out how to help Obama .
Obama announced that he would change his vote in _UNK_ .
In August , he said he would not sign a _UNK_ .
In the summer , the big campaign was built ,
He said , I think a lot . I &apos;m going to change my point .
They _UNK_ Obama , and they changed the presidential vote .
He was the biggest one in a few weeks .
He basically says , &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about this problem .
But in general , I should vote for the ticket I should vote .
But I want you to know , I understand you and I have my opinion .
I &apos;m not going to compromise at this point .
It didn &apos;t _UNK_ anybody . But it happened in this conversation .
No one was trying to hide in the Obama campaign .
And the simple idea is that it &apos;s
In this world , media is global , social , _UNK_ and cheap ,
and the media of the people in the world
And in this world , the media is obvious .
I mean , anyone who has the information
to understand how the information media is .
&quot; How do we better apply this medium ?
although he meant that we must change the way to perform it . &quot;
I think this is a very interesting way
because in every society , especially in open democracy ,
And only after the idea is that reality can change .
In _UNK_ , the United States experienced a great depression
of all kinds of ideas about social safety issues .
and _UNK_ the rest of the events in Roosevelt .
the Reagan Revolution in the &apos; 80s , _UNK_ the government
is what I call the idea of what &apos;s going on .
that makes the _UNK_ of India today .
And the second idea is , I call them &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
And the third idea that I call them
The fourth idea is that I think the most important idea
We &apos;re looking at the problems of other countries in the world .
For India , I think there are six ideas
that makes the _UNK_ of India today .
And this is what the people are paying
is the most fundamental change in the minds of India .
The birth rate begins to decrease . This is the stage in India .
and the young people who have a high dividend
India will be the only one in the world .
In other words , India will become the only young country in the world .
And this is a very important thing . It &apos;s another thing .
We _UNK_ the characteristics of the population of India .
a _UNK_ in the south and west of India .
And the _UNK_ is going to reach the _UNK_
because the birth rate in this region
has been flat with the basic _UNK_ of Western countries .
It will become the main part of the future .
When they go to work , they learn to _UNK_ at night .
And only in these cases , people can get better
In other words , if we don &apos;t pay for these people ,
And the second thing is that India changed .
a group of _UNK_ people in the world
But now , after _UNK_ , as the entrepreneur started ,
I think the third idea of changing India
English was thought to be a _UNK_ language .
_UNK_ business added English language to help people achieve _UNK_ .
and became the kind of _UNK_ of learning .
and the English language is going to change .
and it was a very _UNK_ threat .
and it &apos;s less than 20 cents per time .
They don &apos;t want the union to think that &apos;s computers .
And then they wanted to use more powerful computers
And then we went through a lot of things
The telephone became a tool for the _UNK_ .
and really changed the way India looked at technology .
And there are hundreds of years of Indian people
the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ rules of _UNK_
And India came out of work all over the world .
and realized that they could participate in the global process
We have a advantage in the population ,
because we are the only young countries in the world .
a little bit of trying to bring democracy into India .
because they want to be different from India .
For example , the _UNK_ , the constitutional _UNK_ , and so forth .
the idea of the human resource that is produced
English language became a kind of special skill
So we &apos;re going to look at the idea of doing this ,
There is no objection to these ideas in society .
but it was impossible to do it .
Because of some reason , we don &apos;t have enough money
The lack of priority , because religion has a much bigger cultural impact .
The primary education has not been considered to be _UNK_ .
More than half the city children go to private school .
So the school &apos;s normal running is a little challenge .
Even so , every one of these people really wanted
And they don &apos;t even want their children to be educated .
For a long time , the infrastructure have no priority to consider
And people who &apos;ve been to India have experienced
that people are going to agree and want to implement
The political _UNK_ over 20 years ago was &quot; _UNK_ , _UNK_ , &quot;
So I believe that this idea has been accepted
So _UNK_ did not think of new Delhi as a typical Indian city .
We &apos;ve been _UNK_ the city for a long time .
And you can see from the real world
I think you can see the trends of our city building
And that &apos;s the same idea that you &apos;ve been accepted yet ,
The last idea of India is a single market .
because when you don &apos;t think of India as a market ,
You don &apos;t care if it &apos;s single because it doesn &apos;t matter .
and every state has its own product market .
is starting to move India as a single market .
So there is a global trend in the internal world .
And then I &apos;m going to talk about the idea
and the argument is often going to be _UNK_
What are these ideas ? First , I think , is our consciousness form .
because of the history of the _UNK_ system
and a lot of the people in India
a lot of political work is to make sure
And that &apos;s what we call the people &apos;s way .
and the idea of the two sides of us
A lot of the problems in India are about consciousness .
This is one of the things that needs to solve
The second point is that our labor policy
They don &apos;t have any social benefits for them .
There &apos;s nothing to do with health care about it .
This is going to change because if you can &apos;t give people
and eventually a lot of people are _UNK_
So we need to build a new set of _UNK_
to get rid of the _UNK_ of today .
and it &apos;s going to take more people to _UNK_ ,
a million people who need jobs to create jobs
It &apos;s hard to get to India in foreign universities .
There &apos;s a lot of problems that are worth caring about
India can be adapted to what &apos;s happening in the West .
what happens in other places and _UNK_ what they need .
We can use technology to increase transparency and other benefits .
The health problem is that you have a heart attack
And diabetes was getting older and more advanced
So we can &apos;t simply take a series of poverty
So we &apos;re going to _UNK_ the way we look at the medical system .
We need a strategy that we need
so that we don &apos;t go to the other extreme .
The cost of health insurance for social welfare costs
There &apos;s an opportunity to build a modern _UNK_ system
so that we don &apos;t have a _UNK_ in old age .
And the other thing that India can &apos;t afford
to give you a concept that every year
We &apos;re going to have two tons per year .
But if India grows up at 8 percent ,
It &apos;s going to be 16 times the average person .
So we said that the revenues grew 16 times less CO2 ,
so that we can change the attitude of the environment
and the new paradigm that we create the country
Why is it important to us in 10,000 miles away ?
We can have democracy that can have open society .
the world &apos;s poverty is going to be _UNK_ .
And this is the _UNK_ of the world .
If we really want to make a difference
We &apos;re going to really set up carbon dioxide .
We &apos;re going to really reduce the use of energy
And India needs to solve these kinds of problems .
And the average increase is about two percent
We &apos;re talking about the growth rate of eight to eight percent
when India grows at three percent of the speed
And the average income is going to be _UNK_ .
that every nine years of income per capita
In other words , we are really _UNK_ the whole process .
And this is very important to the world .
and it should be like I &apos;m looking at this problem .
and how this force is inspired by survival .
This is an event on the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It is the most serious disaster in the history of _UNK_ .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
I was the only doctor in the _UNK_ during the disaster .
We all set the tent to the top of the mountain .
It &apos;s actually a _UNK_ , but it &apos;s frozen , very slowly _UNK_ ,
And when you &apos;re deep , it feels like a mouse in the Maze ,
It &apos;s going to be until the night comes , all the ice is frozen ,
to avoid the ice in your feet .
This is some time in the _UNK_ , on the _UNK_ to climb .
We climb a ladder with a safety rope .
Some of the _UNK_ have such a deep depth , even deeper .
the first block that came to the top of the building .
From there , we went on to the _UNK_ camp ,
You can see the side of the _UNK_ .
For 45 degrees , it will take two days to _UNK_ .
If you look carefully , the summit is black .
and the top of the ridge looks like a cloud .
This is the _UNK_ camp in the _UNK_ ,
Once you get to four camp , you only have about 24 hours
to decide whether you &apos;re going to want to be _UNK_ .
So you have to make a decision very quickly ,
He was the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
This is the radio he used to call his wife ,
This is the radio he used to call his wife ,
They &apos;re in the camp . You can see , the _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
So these are just _UNK_ , and it &apos;s going to slow down .
In fact , the _UNK_ is really _UNK_ .
to be quiet . There is no wind at all .
It looks like the best chance of _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
And here &apos;s some of the things that are starting to move forward to the top ,
This was done at night because the _UNK_ was better than this ,
So , at night , you can get valuable sunlight .
This is the scene of the _UNK_ ridge .
The storm was _UNK_ at the sight of the _UNK_ .
This is a year ago that I had
And you can see that I took a _UNK_
You can see that there are two _UNK_ in this climber ,
This is what you need . In the _UNK_ , all your _UNK_ are exposed .
This is a photograph taken on the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s very steep on both sides ,
Once you lose your life , you will combine with other people .
If you fall down on the left , you fall down .
But no matter what , you &apos;re going to die .
And along the top of the mountain , you see ,
And the climber was in the _UNK_ storm .
The storm was so violent that we had to lie down ,
in order to prevent the tent being _UNK_ .
We keep in touch with some of the people in their radio .
This is a photograph taken along the _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ is in the middle of the storm ,
He &apos;s been exhausted . He &apos;s going to stay close to him .
We also heard some other bad news about the storm .
They got lost . The mountain was a _UNK_ .
All the information is _UNK_ , and many are _UNK_ .
We really don &apos;t know anything about the storm .
decided to try to rescue people who might rescue ,
They tried to send radio information to the _UNK_ .
The most important thing is to save yourself . &quot;
_UNK_ and Peter finally arrived at _UNK_ ,
to meet them as a _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
but they were still _UNK_ around the _UNK_ .
We have those who have the ability to set up
Those who cannot set themselves , we decided to lay them on the _UNK_ camp .
So the _UNK_ is going down the line .
This is in the _UNK_ camp , where I was at the time ,
to try to check them and see what I can do .
to see if they &apos;re suitable for me .
For those who are not _UNK_ , the hands are not _UNK_ ,
so that they can continue to the _UNK_ .
It is sometimes difficult to recover in such a _UNK_ place .
I even had to take a _UNK_ of their clothes directly .
At that time we were unable to _UNK_ him at any time .
He called in and told us that he is now _UNK_ .
He called in and told us that he is now _UNK_ .
But _UNK_ has become so weak that he can &apos;t climb on the ground .
But _UNK_ has become so weak that he can &apos;t climb on the ground .
_UNK_ asked her to interact with her . We reached his request .
And that was the last time we heard his voice .
What I was faced with was almost impossible to finish the medical mission --
So what we did was we took these patients
to the _UNK_ feet . It was easier for me to heal them .
I had the _UNK_ to the camp so that I could use it .
I had the _UNK_ to the camp so that I could use it .
I had the _UNK_ to the camp so that I could use it .
I had the _UNK_ to the camp so that I could use it .
But in fact , he walked into the tent and said to me ,
Though he was sober , he was _UNK_ by serious _UNK_ .
It will be _UNK_ , when it reaches the _UNK_ stage ,
It will be _UNK_ , when it reaches the _UNK_ stage ,
It will be _UNK_ , when it reaches the _UNK_ stage ,
Some of the climber passed him , looked at him ,
Some of the climber passed him , looked at him ,
Some of the climber passed him , looked at him ,
And after the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
He stood up and found the way to camp .
This is the three parts of the brain :
So let &apos;s cut the brain down here ,
This is part of the _UNK_ , the basic mechanism is in the back .
So let &apos;s take a look at this section ,
In this case , he wasn &apos;t thinking about his family or anybody else ,
He is trying to _UNK_ his muscles , out of danger .
The weather was too cold that he could not maintain his metabolism .
He was paralyzed . All the men had become _UNK_ .
He was paralyzed . All the men had become _UNK_ .
And that &apos;s how he &apos;s going to think about it .
The brain in this part is called the _UNK_ .
This is where people make decisions and _UNK_ will .
And after a day , one night and a day ,
he would have enough energy in that area
He started to gather more energy in the frontal lobe .
He was thinking about how to save himself .
to think about a way to make him _UNK_ .
He is now no longer concerned with his family , but in thinking about how he _UNK_ himself .
This is the back of the brain , helping his muscles to _UNK_ ,
His heart and lung will begin to _UNK_ up .
If we can connect _UNK_ to the computer scan ,
And I guess that &apos;s what he was doing
This is where I took care of _UNK_ feet ,
than all the things he did in the world
This shows you the power of the human will .
He was ill . There were many other patients who were ill .
_UNK_ the highest helicopter on the history of human history .
It could land on the ice , and it would _UNK_
and before we go to the headquarters of our headquarters ,
And the _UNK_ stood around the rocks ,
to _UNK_ , to talk to them directly .
is because he can call the incredible _UNK_ ,
in the spirit of the spirit of him
Your message will be _UNK_ by the gods .
three years ago , I got a call and I did a film before I did ,
I hope I can tell the story of the new continent of _UNK_ .
And I came up in the middle of the day
We all have this experience in the world .
And I thought , I just finished a film about _UNK_ ,
And I realized that I had to dig their stories ,
So I was so excited to fall asleep .
It was less than _UNK_ in the morning , but it was more like midnight .
So I had this idea : Why can I really _UNK_ this story ?
to tell everything from the party &apos;s point , not subjective ?
He is the _UNK_ of the public affairs of the country .
He knew me , and I said , &quot; Greg ? &quot;
He was one of the most _UNK_ in the world ,
Like Tony , he finally gave me the opportunity to try .
I went to _UNK_ in the next 10 days .
I chose a group -- the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ --
In the second place , they were in the _UNK_ base ,
One of the _UNK_ that I can do is to _UNK_ these soldiers .
I didn &apos;t fully understand the _UNK_ of the matter .
And so that means that when I get _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m going to jump out in front of 180 men and tell my ideas .
You can imagine all kinds of problems like _UNK_ to me .
&quot; You know , you know , you know the National Guard ! &quot;
I spoke from the colony of _UNK_ , _UNK_ war .
So I want to show a clip of the film .
is our trailer because I know you &apos;re all busy --
Many people may not have the opportunity to see it .
And then I &apos;m going to take a detailed picture .
_UNK_ : I really want to do that ? Maybe it &apos;s not .
_UNK_ : We should not talk to the media .
Come here ! OK ? In Iraq , we &apos;re here !
Every soldier eventually wants to fight against the war .
that you don &apos;t have a good thing to do .
Every time you go out , you have a attack .
Hey , you &apos;ve got a butt on me ?
_UNK_ &apos;s wife : It &apos;s really hard for the child .
_UNK_ &apos;s wife : It &apos;s really hard for the child .
_UNK_ &apos;s girlfriend : Just start , he meant , &quot; Don &apos;t write something like that ! &quot;
_UNK_ : We &apos;re driving a car , now seeing the _UNK_ King , a American food .
I support Bush . We &apos;re not going to have oil .
He was completely _UNK_ to a man .
Kevin _UNK_ : We &apos;re going to help the people in Iraq --
Smith was hit ! Smith was hit by the _UNK_ ?
20 years later , it will become a better country because we are
And I had one thing to talk to you about
is to talk about a problem that is difficult to talk about .
I &apos;d like to quote a little bit about TED .
I don &apos;t know how many of you might think about it ,
But there was a TED man just coming back from Iraq .
I want to tell you a little story .
to be the top , with the Sony camera and the _UNK_ software .
And people went to my tag , and they saw &quot; The _UNK_ &quot; --
We &apos;re talking to some of the other people here ,
I mean , we talked about an hour .
And it really _UNK_ some of the things I hope
I hope you can think about it and hope you will help .
which is , I think a lot of people are talking about war ,
And that &apos;s because we may not agree with it .
How can we talk about _UNK_ , really a conversation ?
&quot; You know , if you don &apos;t have her , I &apos;m not going to talk here ,
I really talked to James yesterday , like ,
You know , I can answer the question of film ,
But if I &apos;m going to go on for 18 minutes , it &apos;s really a very hard time .
So I want to say , &quot; Paul , I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here ,
But if there is no network ( help ) , there will be no film .
It takes two weeks to come from Iraq to me .
At the same time , soldiers -- we can email and instant chat .
I would like to take this data out of it .
But there &apos;s a _UNK_ email and a chat , and a message ,
And I _UNK_ it because we see this as a _UNK_ process
and introduce it to you how it is _UNK_ .
It &apos;s going to be a big game today .
We are going to give this group a fair opportunity .
So what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to move forward .
Because , you know , we have advantages . I &apos;m just _UNK_ .
that we had a _UNK_ of the windows .
Well , we &apos;re going to catch up there .
We thought that the explosion was happening in the _UNK_ door ,
Please hold up the back of the door and finish .
about 20 people die , at least 20 or 30 _UNK_ injury .
It &apos;s like -- there &apos;s no blood from the wound .
It &apos;s like a hole goes through the body .
They just had a burning body here , a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
I estimate that the _UNK_ should not be there .
The soldiers _UNK_ in the corner of the _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
I later heard that the death of these Iraq would not be _UNK_ .
They can work hard , but they can &apos;t die there .
If those useless healthcare officials told me that I stopped treatment ,
The same car bomb causes eight _UNK_ death , so many people get hurt .
I felt that I was used , and I was proud of it .
It &apos;s more _UNK_ than a bad joke , I prefer to laugh at it .
I should be grateful for God to get me back .
And tomorrow it will not take a little time to get you to the plane again .
I said , trying to tell a story , not _UNK_ --
Chris told me that this was happening in his _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a new attempt to make a film .
When I saw these soldiers , 10 people agreed to _UNK_ me .
I was sent from Steve _UNK_ to my email ,
and add the _UNK_ picture of the dead body , outside the car .
It was obvious that it was a very bad day .
And then I found Mike _UNK_ in my _UNK_ window .
&quot; Mike , please ask you to interview _UNK_ ? &quot;
because we often have a lot of _UNK_ ,
is the _UNK_ interview after the event , you know .
is the _UNK_ interview after the event , you know .
There &apos;s a camera there -- a gun gun ,
There &apos;s a camera there -- a gun gun ,
So you &apos;re actually taking the first time to experience the event .
And the interview you just saw was Mike _UNK_
I know the contents of the diary , but it &apos;s very private .
So until he came home five months later ,
So , the news clip I put in the film was designed --
You know , I think the mainstream media has done whatever they do .
But I know that people are always listening to ,
&quot; Why don &apos;t they go to the good news we do ? &quot;
The _UNK_ and another military _UNK_ were all _UNK_ out in camp .
They &apos;re going to save the entire day --
And I think they can share these stories , the best gift ,
In many cases I felt the opposite of the _UNK_ ,
But you don &apos;t seem to know more about it .
I was as _UNK_ as other people , but I really think --
You know , different people talk about their concerns about the world ,
My worries are that we have to do this .
We have to go deeper into something that we think is very familiar
But we just need a little bit of communication .
For me , it was trying to get rid of the _UNK_ .
In -- I &apos;m always asked , you know , for me ,
The most special moments in the process of making the film .
You know , I &apos;m sure all of you will do this --
There are so many people around you want to ask questions .
But there are always a few people , almost every time , they finally ask .
And I knew that these people were always soldiers .
And for me , people told me the most profound story ,
For those who haven &apos;t seen the film , it &apos;s not a _UNK_ --
A lot of civilian accidents -- it &apos;s pretty common .
People blocked the chariot and were killed by the _UNK_ .
In the movie , there was an act of a woman who was killed in Iraq .
a soldier came to me , standing , and you can imagine , very close --
And then I saw him start to tears .
I know what he &apos;s going to say next .
I &apos;m worried she would think I &apos;m a devil . &quot;
And I said , &quot; You know , it &apos;s going to be okay . &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;ll take her to see your film .
is not just about those who are _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not like the World War , with the front and the _UNK_ ,
&#91; Now you can live in a life and feel that there is no war . &#93;
They said , &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m against war , but I supported them . &quot;
Are you -- if you find yourself a neighbor , are you going to spend some time and time ?
It doesn &apos;t matter to ask , just stay together and see if they want to say something ?
Do you give any charity organization that you have ? &quot;
You know , obviously , this extraordinary job like Dean _UNK_ --
But you can give a lot of charity to help injured men .
to bring those who claim us to support someone , right ?
I want to say that my hope is , I ask you ,
Think of this as a pixels , a flight pixels .
We call it induction design in the lab .
Now if you take this photograph -- I &apos;m Italian ,
And this picture comes up with them .
If you want to win the gold medal in the _UNK_ ,
You just have budget , and you put your budget on it .
If your car and _UNK_ are good enough , you &apos;ll win the medal .
Now , if you want to win the gold medal ,
and use this feedback to give the car itself
basically , this system includes two parts of the system
that can be _UNK_ and _UNK_ in the past .
If we can optimize the city , it &apos;s actually a _UNK_ .
The city is only about the surface of the earth ,
but they took over the _UNK_ of the world .
They &apos;re using the energy consumption of the world .
So if we optimized the city , it would be a race .
In a sense , like every atom of atoms
and it &apos;s completely changing what we call human beings .
It was just a dream of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And at the end he took up _UNK_ , Moses --
In fact , you see the little _UNK_ under the bottom --
Our environment is starting to give us feedback .
One time , with our consciousness to induction and respond to our environment .
I want to share with you the first project
is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
It was before six months ago in Italy .
It was actually a new network that was happening
that we &apos;ve now covered the world --
and through this network to collect any terminal ,
Some of you probably remember , there was a game of Italy ,
In the middle of the game , you call quickly , the toilet last year .
At that night everyone went to celebrate the town town .
The next day , every person went to the center of the city
You see this place called the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
There will be a great party that sees peak during the end of this day .
Now , this is just one of the examples of how we now feel this city ,
All the Apple Computer _UNK_ , how to assemble together .
but we don &apos;t know where these _UNK_ are going to be .
to track these waste so that it moves in the system .
In fact , we &apos;re working with some volunteers
different kinds of things , like what you see --
I actually can do the same thing with less energy .
But there &apos;s a lot of junk transportation and _UNK_ things .
It &apos;s not going to go out of the cup ,
We would have a bottle of plastic every day .
and a lot of the amazing things that we can do ,
But I want to start with the second part ,
is about what we did in the Spanish _UNK_ a few years ago .
It began to ask a question about the mayor ,
that Spain , in the south of Europe ,
The problem is : technology , new technology , how can we get talents
One idea is that a research group from MIT
you create a _UNK_ of water as a pixels .
And you &apos;re close to it , it &apos;s going to even close
And then we get the access to the World _UNK_
If you _UNK_ a little bit of water , you can actually reduce the roof .
In the winter , you will often be able to see
and people would say , &quot; They &apos;re _UNK_ the building . &quot;
No , they didn &apos;t _UNK_ it , just when it fell ,
And you can see how people get into it .
And this is what I &apos;m trying to do ,
I should tell you what happened in the evening .
but it made it more interesting to the night .
And all the kids in _UNK_ are _UNK_ ,
because the way to go into the building becomes different .
the building will not open you into the room ,
But the building is still divided into different spaces .
We often consider how people use what we &apos;re designing .
with physical pixels , the water can be made ,
And it reminded me that it was going to happen
and every single one has a little _UNK_ pixels --
It &apos;s almost like a piece of clouds that can move in the air .
you get a screen or a _UNK_ screen , like this --
_UNK_ down like the grid that had just been formed .
When you turn on it , you actually look at it . It &apos;s the same way we did before .
Imagine every one of them was controlled by people .
I &apos;ll show you some of the first things that I showed you .
And it &apos;s going to come up with it .
But once you have these pixels , you can control them
We want this to be a possible way to fly fire .
I want to show you the last project we &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s what we do for the Olympics in London .
is to _UNK_ our digital _UNK_ to build --
Think about how you can make everyone _UNK_ a pixels .
What happened was that it was extraordinary .
We &apos;ve experienced the physical world to the digital world .
We want it to design and create a logo .
How do we go from digital world to physical worlds .
So we can actually make the collective participation
This is a cloud , and it &apos;s made of pixels ,
And this is in London , in London ,
You can get into it , and you can &apos;t feel the same experience .
and really use it as a bridge to connect society .
and some of the things that you can get to the top ,
This is a new digital torch at night --
to create an experience that anyone can get to the peak .
This is evil for science , so I think it &apos;s perfect .
Take a walk , who is my _UNK_ ? - Who &apos;s my favorite ?
Oh , if I walk through the neighborhood , who knows I &apos;m going to be so nice .
It &apos;s only a telephone and a _UNK_ conversation .
We &apos;re good friends , this is really cool because we &apos;re not lonely ,
The shallow bank is not about _UNK_ my _UNK_ .
and we &apos;re going to be able to get together ,
It is only our _UNK_ acid every day , so we have no twins .
We &apos;re going to live , right , nature &apos;s not name her , she &apos;s my _UNK_ . &quot;
It &apos;s rich but not healthy people are living together with me ,
and see who &apos;s born -- &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
There is no shortage of _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and there is no natural egg --
and let them see what &apos;s cute after the _UNK_ .
My friends , like Disney or _UNK_ , are _UNK_ . Oh , our friends can copy _UNK_ like _UNK_ _UNK_ or _UNK_ _UNK_ .
We know that our cancer is more benign than _UNK_ -- we find that we &apos;re not even bigger than _UNK_ ,
We are going to live , and should sign beauty rather than Sony .
You &apos;re my _UNK_ . &quot; Oh , I love you . &quot;
is expansion . I think you &apos;re my deadly spot . You &apos;re my _UNK_ . &quot;
Obviously , this is what we know about the Arctic ,
And this will soon be invisible to us ,
Maybe it &apos;s three or five years later . It &apos;s awful !
So we all think about what we can do about it .
When we see the source of carbon dioxide in the world ,
And in this _UNK_ we have a great idea .
So this is a great idea . We want to reduce 80 percent of this number .
This is our lab . It &apos;s not shown before .
Different recipes are finding the best formula and _UNK_ our goals .
And then we build a line in China .
Unfortunately we will not build a line in the United States .
you will see the first new _UNK_ line
and produced the first block in December _UNK_ .
This is the _UNK_ _UNK_ on board . That &apos;s the line that &apos;s running .
The most exciting thing is to look at these people .
They worked for the project for two years .
They &apos;re so excited . That &apos;s the first block in the offline .
Our running vice president is _UNK_ this piece . Obviously he is very excited .
It will have a huge impact on the environment .
A few weeks later we signed the _UNK_ , and everyone _UNK_ his name on the first piece .
that people in the world can begin to use these products .
And we &apos;ve been able to invent _UNK_ materials recently .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned . The _UNK_ _UNK_ gas
Maybe you don &apos;t know that it &apos;s about six _UNK_ around the planet .
All of us must change , otherwise we can &apos;t easily solve this problem .
Don &apos;t listen to the people around the _UNK_ that you can &apos;t do it because everyone can do it .
For the unemployed , we will offer _UNK_ jobs .
We have four factories and are building throughout the country .
The amount of carbon emissions in plaster is equivalent to _UNK_ ,
&quot; Hey , you &apos;re doing a good job . You &apos;re working with your team .
So I want you to leave the TED TED ,
When I don &apos;t know how to do it , please contact me . I &apos;ll help you .
And finally , Bill Gates , I know you invented Windows _UNK_ .
Look , next year we can invent the window .
I was part of a great team in Israel
Some of you in this room will _UNK_ this number .
This is the device that I was in physics
We &apos;re going to hit a goal in the brain .
And then I &apos;m going to talk about _UNK_
to treat the brain injury of the brain .
This idea was that before I was born ,
He was in the early days of _UNK_
This is a complete device with focused ultrasound system .
with the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
a lot of the patients who refuse to surgery
We &apos;re going to put the patient on the _UNK_ stage ,
with sensors that are on the brain ,
is going to be the same kind of sensors
But do you see some of these green rectangle or _UNK_ ?
And this is what &apos;s going on in the treatment
is the dot in the middle , where the arrow is --
The mouse is the only device he needs in treatment .
And he goes on the &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; and then ,
between the head and the sensors that are water .
This is the particular function of the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ images and temperature of real time are _UNK_ .
And you can see these dots on the image ,
But the point is that we have the goal
The _UNK_ hit the target of the target
If this state continues to be more than _UNK_
This is the result of the patient &apos;s eye --
And John wrote all of these things , and he said ,
His wife said , &quot; This is the happiest moment in my life . &quot;
And what I want to say is that
It &apos;s about three _UNK_ in the middle of the brain .
and people have all kinds of painful things .
And he had a pain that he had
and riding a horse regularly to the _UNK_ .
The good news is that we can do a lot
This is something that &apos;s been proven outside the U.S.
and the thing is that it &apos;s not going to work .
The two are the first way to focus on _UNK_
But there &apos;s a message to the guy here ,
some of the other things that are happening in _UNK_ --
The difficulty is that we have to do the _UNK_
Now there &apos;s a news to the women ,
And sometimes it &apos;s going to lead to
This is the choice that can &apos;t be accepted .
And she took the choice in 2008
She became a mom of a healthy baby .
I want to leave you with four information
I think it &apos;s going to relieve the burden of doctors
And I want you to think about it .
He was totally sober and even able to _UNK_
She found the _UNK_ coat when she was running around .
She looked at the _UNK_ of the clothes and the coat &apos;s structure .
She said , &quot; I &apos;ll buy it , but I &apos;ll have to copy it . &quot;
And that was the history of her fashion .
not to do a little bit of a change coat ,
It &apos;s illegal to be able to do it .
But this is actually proven to be legal .
And that &apos;s because of the artists at the _UNK_ ,
Now , based on this reason , this fashion industry
And then the other people will have to get the sleeves or the _UNK_
But it &apos;s too _UNK_ ? How do you look at fashion ?
Now , you have no rights in the middle , no innovation .
And the logic is very familiar with people
The _UNK_ industry is critical to success .
They also _UNK_ because of the _UNK_ of the time .
And I heard that when you walk up
What do people think this is a mystery , how is it going to happen ?
And that &apos;s because people copy other things are legal .
There &apos;s a few people in the top of the fashion chain .
These people decide what we &apos;re going to wear in a certain degree .
But if you talk to any designer at any level ,
in the streets and you _UNK_ with me ,
And it &apos;s where they really get a lot of
So it &apos;s both a _UNK_ and a _UNK_ industry .
and get the biggest benefit of the world .
They &apos;re still facing a lot of _UNK_ ,
But those fashion designers are usually not going to win action .
The court has been _UNK_ over and over , &quot; You don &apos;t need to
If you can buy 200 _UNK_ , why are you going to say 1,000 _UNK_
That &apos;s why we had a meeting in _UNK_ a few years ago .
He just finished a short term job in _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
In fact , it &apos;s not a lot of research , very simple research ,
And , you know , a _UNK_ is never going to be
At least in the material , they are usually made of cheap materials .
that can inject extra life into a dying trend .
One of the things that has been criticized
It can be used for the selection of choices .
This is actually because of this rapid fashion industry .
And this is a good thing , I need more choices .
to help you show yourself to the world .
The current world is actually established faster than the past .
They don &apos;t want to wear the same thing with other people .
And so they tried to do the best
I tell you that fashion is not going to rest .
to come up with the best ideas that everybody likes .
_UNK_ _UNK_ is a very successful shoe designer .
He complained about the design of the people .
He said , you know , it forced him to boost his game .
And this must be done with a _UNK_ .
And if you make some cheap materials ,
and it forced him to become more creative .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard it . But I heard it ,
He said that he invented one more reason
The white musician will not be able to copy the sound .
He tried to give it a copy of it .
And that &apos;s what fashion design has always been doing .
because they put the signature out of the track ,
But now we have a different comedy actor .
It &apos;s a fashion design for _UNK_ fashion design ,
Now the other thing that fashion designers have done
They also tried to get a whole new population
&quot; We are only _UNK_ in the United States
But if you look at two other biggest markets in the world ,
and say , I think it &apos;s a big market in the world ,
You must prove that your clothes were in the past .
In the European Union they went to the other direction .
But although it was the _UNK_ of rapid fashion ,
And here you have a lot of luxury design ,
Now , this is because of the new standard .
A man can come to the _UNK_ of others ,
and then go to the EU , _UNK_ a new , original design .
In Europe , there &apos;s a lot of things being registered .
Even though the retailers have refused to accept the idea .
and some of the different parts of the world are so difficult .
It needs a lot of lawyers and a lot of court time .
And _UNK_ estimates that it costs about _UNK_ .
And there are many other industries that have no rights .
whatever it looks like , or it looks really cool ,
_UNK_ , I think they are instructions , a little bit like a cookbook .
_UNK_ artists , they don &apos;t want rights , it &apos;s not really cool .
So you blame the people who are _UNK_
And this is a lot of other industries ,
as we just saw this very small bar ,
Because now , those are being protected by copyright ,
and it &apos;s going to work on the _UNK_ .
And when I found that there were many industries
I need a graph , and the lawyer doesn &apos;t offer it .
a little bit like the binary opposite in the _UNK_ .
than that , but this is a little bit more complicated .
And they had a little bit of money , and they made it .
These things , because we can easily copy and spread ,
Let me tell you , we don &apos;t want to give the question to the lawyers .
trying to solve what the ownership pattern is ,
If you want to know more about this research ,
There &apos;s a little _UNK_ at the end of each branch .
You can even stand on the top of the plant
This plant lives in the desert of Chile ,
It is the next partner of the _UNK_ .
and stood behind the _UNK_ of our time .
because I want to start with what we think is zero years
You see this tree now called the _UNK_ ,
This tree is the catalyst I started to do this project .
I knew I had to go and see
And I went back to my home in New York City
So this process is going to grow up
I was surprised to find that there was no branch in science
I was really going to go to Greenland for these _UNK_ .
some of the particular experiences that are going to add up
And one time I was going to take a boat
and found that some of the _UNK_ that were there
And I was giving them a text message ,
So I really could only take the equipment that I had .
We have an opportunity to go fishing in the river
you can catch a long _UNK_ in your hands .
And if you look for the death loop ,
In a few studies of the pesticide biologists ,
And although I &apos;m not sure whether this picture is _UNK_ ,
but I &apos;m sure it &apos;s going to be below the tree .
You can see the fungi are actually _UNK_ the tree .
And the way to do it is to benefit itself .
I had to overcome the deep water to find it .
You can see the _UNK_ surface of the brain is broken .
This is because of a group of little _UNK_ fish
But more fortunate , it seems to have been _UNK_
And although that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to lose .
any of the ancient creatures on the planet ,
is one of the most powerful creatures in the world .
I asked the biologists who found this tree ,
He told me that we see some _UNK_ in the middle
And as the temperature of the top is rising ,
because there &apos;s always no animals in my project .
Do you know the biggest _UNK_ of age ?
It can be able to respond to _UNK_ .
What jellyfish can live in the natural environment so long .
You can see , she grows in a courtyard of a church .
And there are some old people who are _UNK_
In fact , Mr. _UNK_ grew up in those places and then people _UNK_ around the _UNK_ .
Now we &apos;re going to look at the rest of the world .
I had the opportunity to go to South Africa
And I think that all of these organisms
And they also recorded the history of nature and human history .
The center of the tree is gradually _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
Now we &apos;re going to look at another one of my favorites .
It &apos;s only in the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ part of the sea ,
to collect the functions of the water in the sea .
and you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s located in _UNK_ .
And it looks like the leaves of two large leaves ,
and you find some of the _UNK_ forests ,
But there is no signs that they come from .
I think this is the most ancient part of these _UNK_ creatures .
I asked the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ garden ,
It &apos;s very dry and easy to be _UNK_ ,
is , you can imagine this as a whole tree ,
And what we can see is the leaves of the ground .
and back to the United States , some of the same old plants .
And even though , you can see this ,
And it &apos;s also a _UNK_ , a _UNK_ system ,
This is a _UNK_ _UNK_ that leaves about a mile away ,
It &apos;s a little bigger than the age of _UNK_ .
You can see it &apos;s a similar circle of circles .
And they were two , _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
This is a big difference in national parks that are protected by growth .
Now I want to show you that it &apos;s possible
They want to take it into the _UNK_ of other planets .
The most _UNK_ living environment on our planet is studied .
They &apos;ve been studied on permanent frozen _UNK_ , and they found
And that means that it doesn &apos;t have any _UNK_ .
This is a map I put all the oldest organisms together ,
so you can see them in the world ; it &apos;s all over the world .
The blue flag represents the creatures that I &apos;ve taken ,
The red flag represents the place I want to go .
So , I &apos;m going to have a couple of years left ,
I really felt that I understood the core of the job .
in the mountains or at the end of the water .
And they can &apos;t stand up very easily , very quickly .
I hope , by looking for these creatures ,
where the government can follow text from the text .
If you take a big laser printer from any big company ,
It seems that no one has made a fuss about it .
This is the question of the Internet today .
If we look at what &apos;s happening in the online world ,
We were _UNK_ by the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
When we were infected with computers to online shopping .
And when the account is frozen , you know ,
And I asked a guy who was going to lead
Now , all of us or most of us ,
because they know that these services are more reliable
They can also , if they attack a foreign authority ,
So , for example , what happened in Egypt ?
They found a lot of papers when they were _UNK_ .
all of the communications of the national public .
But the Western government also did it for them .
If you are a suspicion of a criminal case ,
Obviously , your telephone will be listening to the monitor .
But because I &apos;m legal , I &apos;m not going to really influence me .
Any power we give is always going to lose .
and the problems that are worried about .
I found that no matter what &apos;s going on , I hear it &apos;s like ,
They want to have a kind of _UNK_ life .
And they would say , &quot; Well , I really want to live in a meaningful way
I don &apos;t want my family or my friend , &quot;
And someone hears that , &quot; I want to do the poor job .
I was a very late woman to marry .
I would say , &quot; Your job is not to be perfect .
And what she wrote was a story in _UNK_
She looked at her own girl and thought it was proud .
who had been _UNK_ with a project
And the offspring look at these old people , and they think of
_UNK_ knows that all of us are connected
And that &apos;s what happened in the last year .
Every time we organize our partner , we all get a chair .
whether it &apos;s in New Jersey or in the White House ,
and they would say that they would want to be intelligent
They are _UNK_ to the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
They are mainly about elite and intellectual molecules
there &apos;s only 30 classical _UNK_ that survive .
I had the privilege of seeing the last day
and hope that other people can remember it .
One of the women was standing next to the carriage .
But she didn &apos;t have a hand to feel tears .
They &apos;re going to teach the next generation -- not just the next generation of women ,
And sometimes the most important thing to do
where there was a group of women working there ,
But Agnes was much more interested in power
And although she was involved in a free party ,
three months before the genocide , she moved the party .
She was accused of killing the men more quickly .
And we looked at people who were looking at
I heard people say that the most dangerous animals in the world
And of course , it &apos;s also important for girls .
We also need to know that a lot of times
And once they were sitting in the streets ,
And what they can think about is that
In Acumen Fund , we have a partner ,
is to be able to work on others ,
And he was always together with these boys .
They come from the biggest _UNK_ in the world ,
They read books at TED and they love it .
and then it &apos;s going to invest in patient capital
And we &apos;re always going to give them
Our investment cycle is 10 to 10 percent
And when we take back our investment , we put it into other creative projects .
We &apos;ve invested more than 50 companies in _UNK_ dollars .
And these companies are creating two billion economic benefits .
is not to make money for simplicity .
And we hope that eventually we can be
And my dream is that someday , one day ,
We &apos;re not just praise the ones that get our investments .
And the resources that we get from here
more _UNK_ and anger and fear and fear
learning real estate and work in real estate
After 9 / 11 , he went to Pakistan and wanted to make some changes .
For two years , he had almost no money to make , just a little _UNK_ day .
He was thinking that he would be able to build _UNK_ land
and it took two years to do it .
but I was in the middle of him
&quot; How do you _UNK_ ? This is a community of _UNK_ ?
But finally , the community leaders come together
We need the moral leaders and the courage
It &apos;s usually based on some of the _UNK_ dreams
And we can also choose more difficult ways
a little bit of a work that has been done
is that it &apos;s going to happen to change .
It &apos;s about a six year-old girl , called _UNK_ .
She was the first one in the South to _UNK_ school .
She seems to be talking to someone else ,
And he would ask , &quot; _UNK_ , what do you say ? &quot;
And he finally couldn &apos;t say , &quot; _UNK_ , I really see you speak .
And she said , &quot; Mr. _UNK_ , I &apos;m not talking about it .
Every one of us should have the right to accept education .
And the last story is that a young man
We took him to a company outside 200 miles .
He said to me at the end of the year
because I think as a farmer in Africa
especially when I was talking to women in Africa ,
And sometimes you learn to listen to something that &apos;s hard . &quot;
And he said , &quot; And I thought , &quot; Well , I thought ,
to every man , woman and children on this planet
And we need to have a very humble heart ,
&quot; Only a few people can affect history ,
And when these changes add up , you know ,
And the history of our history is written . &quot;
But at the end , it &apos;s going to let us go .
Let &apos;s take a minute to see the great legend of the great _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s still a _UNK_ for him .
Even though it was a famous _UNK_ , it could not be accepted by many artists .
Is this the face of the _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ is a man who will draw around all kinds of things .
He painted characters , body structure , animal animals , landscape , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , etc .
His contemporary painter has painted self - portrait like you &apos;re seeing here .
I think if we look at all his works ,
and looking for _UNK_ , we can see his faces .
So I looked at all his paintings , _UNK_ ,
As we see in front of us , _UNK_ must be positive or _UNK_ .
So we can also _UNK_ the _UNK_ or the _UNK_ style .
da is very handsome , and even to say it &apos;s a beautiful man .
In this way , we _UNK_ the _UNK_ and the cartoon .
Now look at this again -- there are three candidates for _UNK_ .
The famous _UNK_ is also in it .
The last painting was the only portrait portrait portrait of a male painting in _UNK_ .
I should explain what I have to be here to publish their comments .
For all kinds of newspapers , more than 300 years , I &apos;m sorry , only more than 30 years .
For all kinds of newspapers , more than 300 years , I &apos;m sorry , only more than 30 years .
So I was still aware of painting and analysis .
You sit down , because if we zoom in these faces ,
we &apos;ll find that they have the same big forehead , smooth _UNK_ eyebrows ,
A long nose , a bending lips , small and full _UNK_ .
When I first noticed this , I dare not believe my eyes .
When I first noticed this , I dare not believe my eyes .
We just searched the portrait of the _UNK_ character ,
And if you look at these _UNK_ years ,
And when _UNK_ was writing these pictures ? Is the age of the painting ?
Yes , perfectly . He was 33 years old and 36 years old .
In other words , we now have three pictures of the same person ,
The age of _UNK_ and _UNK_ in the painting is _UNK_ .
But how do we know people in this painting is _UNK_ rather than others ?
This is the only photograph that was widely accepted by _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s taken by 15 year-old _UNK_ as a body model .
And if we take this face of sculpture ,
We &apos;ll find the same features before the musician looks better .
This is the statue , which is going to _UNK_ .
Ladies and gentlemen , this story is not published ,
The _UNK_ of the TED audience was the right thing .
And the machine that we have in our head ,
is what &apos;s the best thing to ask your head .
It &apos;s built for change . It &apos;s all about change .
And it allows us to do it tomorrow ,
when you see the baby in the last time --
And even though she had the brain , in fact ,
in the development of the last few months .
If we test her awareness , we &apos;ll find these capabilities are very primitive .
And there was no signs that she had truly thought .
In fact , there is almost no evidence that
There is no signs that there is someone in the brain .
And they can only use a very primitive , very limited way
to be able to do some simple actions in arbitrary control .
And yet , when we study the brain ,
And these relationships are actually going to be thousands of
At this age , the brain has a very fine _UNK_ capacity .
and its cognitive skills are constantly evolving .
And the question is that at this age ,
The brain has already had a human being to control .
In fact , in this age , the brain controls its development .
In this age , we can see that
The boy can _UNK_ the top of the _UNK_ .
And he came from _UNK_ in Brazil ,
The local boy has the ability to have this power .
But if you go to the Monterey community ,
It is difficult to find a boy who has such ability .
If you find a one , maybe from _UNK_ .
is to build a big set of _UNK_
And that means that every one of us
We all have a kind of special skill and ability ,
For an adult brain , of course , we have a _UNK_
we can move more automatically on memory ,
And that makes us move , moving , thinking about life .
_UNK_ , who is studying the problem of this ,
It &apos;s a strange form of living on the planet ,
We study how these brains learn new skills and skills .
And we tried to record the same time
The first important period is often called the critical period .
In this period , the brain formed its original form ,
But in essence , it doesn &apos;t need to learn
to start a different set of brain .
For example , in the sound of sound ,
and the sound of the growth environment is _UNK_ .
with the sound of a _UNK_ to raise a animal .
What I found is that the brain of this animal
In its running capacity , the brain will sound
_UNK_ is a ideal form of having tissue order .
It doesn &apos;t have to be valuable for this animal .
I can make this animal grow in a _UNK_ environment ,
A child &apos;s tongue is _UNK_ by the sound of the tongue .
I can see the brain actually developed a special processor .
_UNK_ to the sound of this complex sequence .
Or I can put this animal in a completely _UNK_ sound environment .
When I did that , I actually had the brain
to become a key processor for these sound _UNK_ .
The change of the brain is not about learning .
I don &apos;t have to focus on what I hear .
I don &apos;t need to be in a behavior environment .
And the brain needs to be able to run this way ,
to make it easier for this particular animal
you can run the brain with a pattern of choice .
In the next day of life , most of the time of life ,
to make it work more perfect and better .
from the first year of life to death .
This function is whether it &apos;s done or not ,
or whether the individual has a reward in this behavior .
We can test a particular technique of learning
We can see or record it in different levels .
In _UNK_ and _UNK_ , scientists at _UNK_ University
This is a very simple experiment that training a monkey
to get it to work on a tool ,
Let a kid learn to use a _UNK_ .
At first , the monkey was completely unable to perform the task .
It was about the eighth of the _UNK_ .
The monkey can carry it to the perfect _UNK_ .
Every time he can succeed with the tool to _UNK_ food .
It &apos;s perfectly perfect control , repeated and tried .
We can study the internal brain of this monkey .
We can record these changes , and with time change ,
This map is the skin of a monkey &apos;s palm .
This is a brain that is _UNK_ on the surface of the brain ,
We use a very fine experiment , in every area ,
This is a very detailed mapping of neurons .
in this pink area . We can see these two fingers add up .
The _UNK_ are used to control the tools .
We can see that this monkey has changed .
In this case , the most _UNK_ skin layer
A single , simple competitor &apos;s finger - finger finger is characterized .
But now it is characterized by the region as a more exquisite texture .
The monkey gets more detailed information from these surfaces .
And these changes that are associated with skill or ability ,
In fact , in the study of monkey learning ,
Each region is based on the skill or ability .
For example , we study the _UNK_ cortex ,
_UNK_ the location of the input gesture .
We &apos;ve been studying the _UNK_ regions of _UNK_
In other parts , the monkey &apos;s behavior needs to be involved .
They are all _UNK_ . They all have the current mission .
When you learn a simple skill like this , 15 or 20
That means that there &apos;s a big change in your brain .
in a way that &apos;s going to change in a stable way .
the number of things that are going to happen .
Think about the process of getting ordinary behavior in children ,
and it &apos;s going to happen in the brain .
because most of the time in the brain ,
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to have .
and the people who have changed a lot .
And the changes in the detail are bigger .
Now , one of the characteristics of this change is ,
This is because the brain is _UNK_ all things ,
and it &apos;s going to be connected in a continuous period of time .
or a _UNK_ , or a _UNK_ , or a _UNK_ ,
As a _UNK_ , you don &apos;t have to be able to
to receive billions of feelings of little pieces of information ,
This is created by physical change in the brain .
because each of us has a very different history ,
And this is going to drive us into personality ,
not only to understand how a normal person is going to develop ,
These may limit the ability to children or adults .
to take the brain to correct the child &apos;s brain ,
And I &apos;m going to talk about some experiments ,
First of all , to understand how it _UNK_ us to lose some function .
And then , through a way of doing it ,
The first example I &apos;m going to talk about is that
And the fundamental problem of this is that
And the reason is that it &apos;s developed in the form of _UNK_ ,
And there &apos;s a lot of reasons for this problem .
But the production of the noise problem is that
And you know , the older friends in this room
When we were small , we thought that a natural _UNK_ child
We know that their cognitive development will be very slow .
We know they learn how to develop normal languages can be difficult .
We know that they learn how to read is difficult .
Most of them fail in IQ and school .
We don &apos;t hear that . How does this happen ?
If you can get enough of the problems that you can solve ,
which is when the brain is starting to shape ,
to put the brain up enough for it ,
So how do we get the _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
from the middle of the _UNK_ tube ,
In this case , children are not English ,
And these rubbish don &apos;t just happen in the ear ,
The brain itself can be noisy . The normal noise .
But some genetic defects can make it more noisy .
And in this brain , this child &apos;s native tongue
The brain machine is set up because of the abnormal space constant ,
It leads to the defects of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
We can check the brain and record the time constant .
And this is going to happen in this way .
They will have a problem . Because as a _UNK_ ,
So they will have a _UNK_ of reading skills .
because reading depends on the sounds of words
If your brain is not _UNK_ to the sound ,
you will have a _UNK_ neural problem with this .
And it took a second and a half ,
The key is that we can get rid of this problem .
You can imagine it , you can actually change
to change the details . It takes 30 hours .
Today , we &apos;ve been working on about _UNK_ children .
In fact , there are about 40,000 children who are now training .
In fact , when you look at it , it &apos;s a big meaning .
The most interesting thing is that these kids are on the left side .
You can see that most children on the left
This is a widely measured test of their languages .
If you train every child in the United States , the impact of this distribution will be ,
And the whole distribution is going to be
Imagine the children in the language of _UNK_ .
Imagine the _UNK_ child in the classroom .
that we might be able to take most of these children
And it also provides an important language dependent on students .
In a very large sense , the training is to repair the brain .
In Stanford , at MIT , San Francisco University ,
in Los Angeles and other institutions in different training ,
We can see the changes in the brain of children .
And we can see in the brain like this ,
that constant and space constant are changing ,
For example , we are characterized by the _UNK_ of language .
as if the brain had a mess ,
And it turns out that we can train people like this ,
This is one of the small parts of the world ,
We found that the improved memory of _UNK_ ,
the ability to remember things after a while of delay ,
And that means that if you &apos;re on the left side ,
And that means that most of the _UNK_
And my point is that it &apos;s going to be more complete .
because I think it &apos;s going to work , and most of you can do it .
My main interest is how to use this science to solve other diseases .
How do you keep your own efficient learning machinery ?
and learning is the continuing , the key ring .
OK . It will be part of the everyday life ,
Every normal part of the life is as _UNK_ .
We think that the literature and the science
And the ultimate way that you have to influence
to think about how to grow ourselves .
Because now you know , science tells us
Of course , a lot of people will ignore the proposal .
to really understand how long it is .
the most _UNK_ story in the _UNK_ world .
I &apos;d better say from my father I &apos;ve been dead .
It &apos;s a completely _UNK_ thing to make you feel .
When I was a kid , he often told me a story
He looked at the scene and saw it _UNK_ .
And he said , at the time , he was _UNK_ ,
He had to hold his hand to protect his eyes .
And he said that he even saw him
I know that the nuclear bomb bomb test
It was a great influence to my father of death .
And he did it for me to encourage me
and let me see how fragile the world is .
He loves history . He &apos;ll tell me how the captain of the captain
So since I was six years old ,
I want to go to the bad things ,
And I was at the beginning of the seven years ago ,
And there &apos;s a great _UNK_ that makes me seven years , every year ,
I saw the polar bear _UNK_ on the thin _UNK_ ,
I want the world to know what &apos;s going on there .
I &apos;d like to _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the world leaders ,
In the world , in a world that is supposed to freeze ,
And we need to do it right now .
The temperature of the ordinary swimming pool is 27 degrees ,
The temperature of the Channel is 18 degrees _UNK_ this morning ,
And in the Arctic , there is only a negative _UNK_ .
I &apos;m sorry , I can only say that .
So I have to build a powerful team
I formed a group from 10 countries , 29 people .
Some people think swimming is totally personal sports project ,
You just jump into the sea and go well .
and it &apos;s not exactly what it is .
And then I started doing this great training .
But the key to training is to be prepared ,
to deal with the challenges that will come .
I have to go back to my head .
I want to taste the _UNK_ of my mouth .
I &apos;m going to see my coach _UNK_ to me ,
&quot; Lewis _UNK_ ! _UNK_ ! _UNK_ ! _UNK_ ! _UNK_ ! Don &apos;t slow down ! &quot;
So I was actually in my mind
After a year of training , I think I &apos;m ready to go .
So I was working with five players .
On the fourth day , we decided to try the water ,
I &apos;ve never been in the water under negative zero ,
And I couldn &apos;t breathe at that time , I was _UNK_ ,
I &apos;ve been able to swim for five minutes .
I remember trying to get out of the water as soon as possible .
And I remember when I took my glasses down ,
When I look at my hands , I _UNK_ .
It &apos;s a very _UNK_ , like a sausage .
They are so _UNK_ that my hands are not together .
And it was because the main component of the body was water ,
My finger cells on my finger are already frozen ,
and they &apos;ve been _UNK_ . And I was _UNK_ .
They _UNK_ me at once and let me get a hot bath .
And I thought , two days later , I &apos;m going to finish swimming across the Arctic ,
I want to try to finish the water for 20 minutes ,
But it was a dream that I was _UNK_ with my father ,
And now it &apos;s going to be a _UNK_ .
How could I go and go down ?
And I remember walking through the _UNK_ ,
And as a swimming player , your hand must be conscious ,
because you &apos;re going to be able to grab water .
is totally _UNK_ by the fall of the _UNK_ .
And what _UNK_ thought was a jazz _UNK_ .
If you don &apos;t know who he was , he was a great British _UNK_ .
A few years ago he tried to _UNK_ the Arctic .
And he went down to the bottom of the sea
He went to a local hospital where the doctor said to him ,
we can only take them off the _UNK_ . &quot;
And he heard it , and he went to his tool ,
And what I thought was that if the _UNK_ had spent three minutes in the water ,
And I lost my consciousness in five minutes ,
So what happens if I &apos;m going to swim twenty minutes ?
It was the best thing I would lose a few fingers .
And the worst thing is , I &apos;m not afraid to go .
Our boat continued to sail to the Arctic
And my friend , who said , &quot; Well , my friend ,
and came to me and said , &quot; Lewis ,
I knew you from your age of 18 .
I &apos;m absolutely confident that Lewis looked at you all the time
and understand why you &apos;re going to do that .
because we are standing at the critical moment of history .
And you &apos;re going to swim with this symbol of _UNK_ ,
to _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the world .
we &apos;ll have a look at the eye to protect you . &quot;
And he made me _UNK_ up my courage ,
So we went on and finally reached the Arctic .
_UNK_ , as scientists predict the same thing ,
And the doctor gave me a chest X-ray ,
There &apos;s a big piece of white ice in it ,
I said , &quot; Lewis , don &apos;t look at the left , don &apos;t look at it ,
I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
Video : Our boat just left the harbor , which is at this point .
The heart will blow up a _UNK_ of silk .
The bear and her mother had a good picture of beauty .
This moment , _UNK_ my dream of the year ,
Oh , maybe two hours I &apos;m going to jump to swimming .
There are ten seconds , and there are 10 seconds .
Be good , the boy ! You &apos;re successful ! Lewis &apos;s success !
_UNK_ : _UNK_ ! You &apos;re all done by the _UNK_ !
Lewis : Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Lewis : I want to end with the following ,
My hand took four months to restore my consciousness .
But is it worth it ? It &apos;s worth it . It &apos;s absolutely worth it .
Now there &apos;s only a few people who don &apos;t know ,
And people asked me , &quot; Lewis , what can we do for climate change ? &quot;
The first thing is that we need to split this problem into
Every country has to be reduced to emissions .
All of us are going to _UNK_ the river .
I remember just a few years ago , when I talked about climate change ,
I just came back from a series of talk ,
in some of the poorest towns in South Africa ,
Tell the children of ten - year - old children .
And I think we have to be able to get to the end of our life ,
turned around and asked us to ask ourselves the most fundamental question .
And that is , &quot; We want to live in a world where we live ,
And what we should do today is ,
In the next few minutes , we &apos;re going to talk about energy .
And it &apos;s going to be a little different talk .
And one of the reasons is that it &apos;s really amazing .
in the right way , in the right way ,
to be able to make a very useful product and fuel .
and there are a lot of oil resources .
And so that &apos;s the distribution of oil in the world .
The _UNK_ have a definite idea to store the oil .
and can continue to be developed and _UNK_ .
But more than that , it was the opposite .
And by the way , if you think that you look away from some oil store ,
is one of the biggest oil in the world .
If you have interest to talk to me . I can offer some information for you .
It &apos;s just a part of the oil , and a lot of it .
But what is oil ? What does it work in the energy system ?
This is a 150 years of oil in the energy system ,
In this 150 years , most of our energy system
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you a little secret .
the amount of oil in the global energy system
In 1985 , the amount of oil is _UNK_ ,
The oil supply system at that time was 50 percent .
In 2007 , the U.S. gasoline consumption could reach peak .
Please see the picture of this very important energy system development .
What is the place of oil in the last decade ?
Well , I &apos;d like to go ahead of the future
I &apos;m not talking about the global energy use ,
That &apos;s another thing to talk to me about this .
Do you think it &apos;s going to end up here ?
We can use the renewable energy to replace oil --
But I think , in fact , it &apos;s more important than that .
And the next part of the world --
Let &apos;s expect that the _UNK_ is even more distant .
I _UNK_ it in the _UNK_ of Texas .
It &apos;s just a _UNK_ , and it &apos;s nothing special .
I got it from _UNK_ . It was a short history .
The chalk is different than the _UNK_ . You can see it .
We &apos;re not going to work with the chalk ,
We don &apos;t write a _UNK_ on the board in the lecture .
Well , they &apos;re not different . They &apos;re not quite different .
the difference is the problem of the molecules .
And by the way , you &apos;re going to be _UNK_ ,
Now , what is the relationship between energy ?
And the reason is that nature doesn &apos;t look like _UNK_ shells ,
So let &apos;s think about the future of energy ,
not because we have a lot of oil ,
And it &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build _UNK_ ,
that we &apos;re not going to end with oil .
And the other one is tiny and very small .
for example , the destruction of corruption and environment ,
to the exploitation of women and children ,
And in all of these areas , we really need
But in general , I think we need a system
_UNK_ wrote that you &apos;re not allowed to do that .
You are in connection to our country &apos;s internal affairs .
This is the _UNK_ of the World Bank .
Many of them love to stay in Nairobi --
But they love to stay here because other cities
one of the most vulnerable and most beautiful places in the world ,
He has no consumers . No one will buy electricity from there .
So everybody knows that this is not just a useless project ,
is a project that is absolutely destructive , horrible .
that the country will be in debt in the future ,
But the project was the first to start doing .
Okay , the projects that we have in _UNK_
will allow thousands of families to be _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s not 100,000 , or a million .
We &apos;re talking about _UNK_ , 20 million dollars ,
more than a billion people are below absolute poverty .
In the end of this , these problems are big .
I was able to figure out how to do it .
The reason is that the members of the World Bank
the Swiss , the Japanese and the Japanese ,
And so this is a _UNK_ dilemma ,
We will not allow our company to overseas overseas .
There is a competitive product in the world .
We are in the _UNK_ Association of Berlin .
We have three different _UNK_ of the meeting
What they did was not _UNK_ . It was a custom .
And there &apos;s a lot of people who have
I don &apos;t believe that other people have stopped _UNK_ .
They have admitted that they don &apos;t do that anymore ,
as Germany and Britain and so on .
In the final session , in the _UNK_ Association ,
This is why the _UNK_ is now in trouble .
This is why _UNK_ is now getting a _UNK_ .
was given to someone who was friendly in a country ,
In this case , they did not _UNK_ in Britain .
to try to get a solution to the problem .
And in Japan , the foreign _UNK_ had no control ,
You can &apos;t _UNK_ the _UNK_ of a _UNK_ ,
The Congress didn &apos;t want to change the point ,
one of the countries in the _UNK_ of moral and good management ,
They have a lot of management in _UNK_ .
We also need to be more qualified civil society leaders .
And that &apos;s why we have a management school in Berlin .
and the civil rights center of the world .
But it &apos;s a very , very practical experience ,
to create a better world with us .
We use _UNK_ to reduce the lives of these people .
So what I &apos;m going to talk about today is not really true .
I want to talk about a project that I started ,
I was the most _UNK_ of my life .
And that &apos;s a lot of people who don &apos;t live in life ,
We want their stories to tell us our offspring .
And so I thought that I had a series of _UNK_ .
It &apos;s basically what it means to be
They asked them to paint themselves through the interview .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you about
How do you deal with these people in this situation ,
and what the reason they &apos;re talking about or _UNK_ .
This is decided by the _UNK_ of the country --
And this is easy , and one decision after that ,
is that the _UNK_ should be at some age ,
And in the course of the project I started ,
It was obvious that they were not old to me .
But I think we need to give the elders a stage ,
Let &apos;s sit on the audience to listen to these elders .
The second point is that as I am older ,
that most of them know the direction of things ,
But the _UNK_ of our _UNK_ is that
And so , we went back to life ,
So we can talk about the _UNK_ of life .
So how do you get this effect ?
and interview people , we all know it .
_UNK_ &apos;s identity is often more important than the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ and other people belong to this , and everybody likes it .
I hope to achieve the _UNK_ , which is what I thought later .
In other words , can they feel what they want to say ?
Don &apos;t forget , it &apos;s all done before the public .
300 audience sitting in front of the _UNK_ ,
And I was _UNK_ to a _UNK_ portrait .
So , I found that I was really good at this .
I did an interview with William _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It was six months after he had a stroke .
He hasn &apos;t seen any _UNK_ after his stroke .
But it also influenced the speech and some other acts .
about an hour , talking about his life ,
After the end , a woman ran to me ,
She said to me , &quot; Where are you trained ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I never learned , I never said that I &apos;ve been learning . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
The word was like a bridge to help him end in the sentence .
But it &apos;s not the question that I &apos;m going to finish that process .
But then I started thinking about other things .
that ordinary people , they never thought of their wisdom ,
And this energy is not the energy of young people ,
But _UNK_ was full of _UNK_ --
And I think that way -- it &apos;s full of energy .
He was thought to be the hardest thing to do ,
But , in fact , he did a great deal of it .
Right , his energy is still in other ways .
So you know , he &apos;s actually a lot of life .
And she said , &quot; You &apos;re going to let George say , &quot;
And she said , &quot; I was his girlfriend , _UNK_ ,
And then she gave me the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Don &apos;t go to interview a guy who &apos;s modest ,
is to say something to someone else , but they sat there and said ,
to make them work for what they &apos;ve done .
The worst interview I did was William _UNK_ .
He is the author of the third German _UNK_ .
The man met Hitler and Gandhi in six months .
Every time I asked him , he would say , &quot; Oh , I just happened there .
I would never have promised to interview a modest person .
And then they would like to share this with you .
is that you need to overcome all those obstacles .
If you get it through interview , it &apos;s only a _UNK_ public image ,
We all know the _UNK_ , knowing that the glory of us ,
The key is that we can &apos;t make people feel embarrassed .
It &apos;s not hard -- maybe you remember somebody
interview is not difficult , and there is no aggressive . There &apos;s nothing about this .
But what I want to do is to tell them what they say ,
to get them out of the _UNK_ of the public image .
This kind of _UNK_ is becoming more _UNK_ .
Let me tell you that this interview series
This is all about the shell in our body ,
and one of the signs that we have .
In short , a very prominent woman in that age .
In fact , when we did the interview ,
And I thought that this should be _UNK_ ,
because I &apos;m always talking to _UNK_ a little bit earlier ,
And before that , we didn &apos;t communicate , because if we were _UNK_ ,
She will be 80 years old in the day of interview .
I asked any questions that she was _UNK_ away ,
I &apos;m basically there -- every one of you
I was in the cold . She wouldn &apos;t say anything .
and I started thinking about what was going on .
This is the question that she &apos;s competing with me .
And so when I asked her a question ,
I don &apos;t know what to answer to it .
I asked her to live on _UNK_ &apos;s life ,
She said , &quot; Well , I was a _UNK_ , so on . &quot;
But I said , &quot; Oh , _UNK_ . Everybody knows I was a _UNK_ .
Many people thought I was an actor , and I never had an actor . &quot;
But I didn &apos;t ask what the actor was , and she started to tears ,
and said , &quot; Well , I have time to be an actor .
And that was a charity in the _UNK_ ,
I went up and said , &quot; And she went on , &quot; I went on the stage . &quot;
And they said to me , &quot; And then she said , &quot; What do you know ? &quot;
And she looked at me as if she had won a fight .
And then she ended up talking about this ,
This story I have to go on . It &apos;s a little gift to _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t have a cold cold , but she &apos;s _UNK_ ,
And she died -- she was due to the advanced brain ,
She may be the most bad way you can think of .
A few people were invited to her dinner party ,
And she went to everybody , and she talked to everybody ,
Then the room , no one ever saw her again .
She wanted to manage her final moment , and she did it , and let it _UNK_ .
There are some other ways to get _UNK_ open ,
but it &apos;s going to be a little bit _UNK_ .
I interviewed Steve _UNK_ . It was a long time ago .
I asked him , &quot; Steve &quot; or &quot; Mr. _UNK_ ,
people say that all the comedy actors have an unhappy childhood ,
And he looked at me like he was saying ,
&quot; How do you come up and ask this question ? &quot;
These are all &quot; _UNK_ &quot; , but really sincere . I said ,
&quot; My father was loving me , and I was very supportive ,
And he looked at me and began to tell his sad story .
In fact , he was also an unfortunate childhood _UNK_ ,
What is the process that starts this ?
People waited for the question of being asked for life .
I &apos;ll just give you two examples of time .
The first is the interview of my great American _UNK_ .
He &apos;s called _UNK_ . Some of you probably know he &apos;s probably not sure .
Right , when I was interviewing , I asked him ,
But in fact , I was more aware of him ,
because I &apos;ve seen all of his letters . &quot;
In other words , he was satisfied with the relationship between them 50 years .
And it took life to study the _UNK_
and he said , &quot; Well , here I &apos;m going to _UNK_ the south accent ,
He said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s right . &quot;
Mr. _UNK_ sometimes _UNK_ the truth of the matter . &quot;
And he was saying , &quot; Well , he was saying ,
He said , &quot; But I understand , &quot; he said , &quot; I understand . &quot;
And he said , &quot; We like to look good at the surface ,
And so he didn &apos;t want to have a lot of positive conflicts . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You see , John Adams is too honest . &quot;
And he began to say something about John Adams , and then he invited me to his house ,
I met his wife , who came from _UNK_ ,
But the question is really the most important question I &apos;ve ever done .
Most of the time , when I mentioned this ,
people would take a _UNK_ because of my bold , cruel ,
But I believe that it &apos;s absolutely the question to ask .
Agnes de _UNK_ was one of the most prominent _UNK_ in history .
And I started to ask her --
By the way , I was really going to marry her , she was so different --
&quot; Come here , we &apos;re going to talk about 15 minutes ,
So I went to the dark New York _UNK_ ,
She was lying in bed when she heard me .
I knew that she had been in the wind ,
So she spent most of her life in bed .
But what I &apos;m going to say is that life --
She did not make up for interviews and makeup .
She thought she had the most interesting thing
It was her will , and she put her hand on her hand .
And she said , &quot; I put my will on the bed , it &apos;s a symbol of death ,
She likes to be a love of her life .
And I thought , I must put her in my interview series .
She came out , and of course she was sitting in the _UNK_ .
She was affected by stroke , and she was _UNK_ ,
And of course , she was ready for the interview ,
But she was suffering from a very large body .
I said , &quot; Have you been _UNK_ by yourself ? &quot;
They think that this problem has some aggression ,
And then she started telling her childhood , and she was beautiful ,
And she turned around -- although her body was weak --
a head _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and so on ,
And then she began to tell the story
She could never expect her to look like her ,
Her family had just seen her as a _UNK_ ,
And she can only go with them .
And in that time , she made some decisions .
and dance is going to be her life .
But if you can be a _UNK_ better ,
Her childhood dream finally came true , she was _UNK_ .
to do this series of interview is my lucky .
There are some moments like this , and some of them make a silent moment .
that are waiting for some of the problems ,
so that they can stick to the real self ,
I suggest that even if you don &apos;t do interviews ,
I have a story to share with you .
a story about hope that life and fascination
And today we have _UNK_ : the third largest Nigeria in the world
In 2006 , Nigeria produced almost 2,000 movies
Think about 40 or 50 movies per week
in the streets of Nigeria and West Africa
It was estimated that the value of this industry was $ _UNK_ million .
It creates at least thousands of jobs
But notice that this is the movement of the ground
no government aid , in fact , was completely expected
And it happened at the hardest time in Nigeria ,
I think I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about
My grandfather lived in the _UNK_ and was buried there .
My father &apos;s adult day is mostly in East Africa .
And although I was three years old , I left there ,
But I really think Africa is a big part of my life .
is the place that I learned to walk
I remember one of the most profound things
is that my family is hard to share with African stories .
Africa is either a continent of _UNK_ .
So we are always _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
I remember I had a strong wish to talk about Africa .
a place where we lived , and people had the same time
So when I saw a business version of a newspaper ,
I know that this is a rare opportunity
Here I can tell a story about how African and I make movies .
For me , this is actually a _UNK_ .
I was at the _UNK_ Center in Boston .
and the producer in the center of the city
We see how digital technology is constantly changing .
that can make the cost of the film
And I had a great deal of support for the film ,
And I found two great partners , and I started with this adventure ,
He said , &quot; _UNK_ , I worked in Africa
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;ve met such a _UNK_
and want to be the most interesting story ,
and I met a meeting with the _UNK_
a brilliant director , who &apos;s here tonight --
We &apos;re going to show you a little bit about this .
We &apos;re following the process of making a action movie ,
I don &apos;t want to make a lot of wishes
The six minutes later , for the TED audience ,
We &apos;ve _UNK_ the editor to show you
In Nigeria , you can make a nice film for 10,000 dollars .
They can watch any film they &apos;re interested in ,
I think in Nigeria , to make film for the industry ,
is a film that keeps survival -- they live .
the more _UNK_ _UNK_ are going to be
If you &apos;re selling well , you &apos;ll start the next new play .
because if you don &apos;t take the next film , you &apos;re going to have a _UNK_ .
that we should be able to _UNK_
I mean , 90 percent of people watch _UNK_ movies
And I think this is the current use of special cable
So if you take a film , whatever it is ,
The problem is that the quality of quality -- the quality is going to increase .
I mean , some films are made for the pursuit of quality .
But first of all , you don &apos;t forget about Africa .
a lot of people &apos;s standard of living is a dollar a day .
And these people are really the audience of these movies .
It &apos;s just coming in the corner of the world .
because nobody believed that _UNK_ could come out of Africa
and the story is that people can _UNK_
These stories are about them , and they make them .
We &apos;ve always been obsessed with a new film
We can create something , when the world sees our creation ,
Come , don &apos;t run away , come back and back .
Now you walk in the streets and you can see a model
You see how he talks , how do you live ?
not just what you see in the film ,
is not what you hear from the Western media ,
I used to be obsessed with the _UNK_ movies
But when I realized that my country was in place ,
a young man is going to get into the room ,
you have to look for the _UNK_ ,
And then I found that I could make an actor
not guilty , cheating people , or lie ,
when the big country was making movies ,
But here , we &apos;re going to be able to play , for example , shooting
They say , now , shooting right , you see the gun ,
but you can &apos;t shoot it , we can make _UNK_ .
I was afraid to fly to my face
I &apos;m just telling her that she &apos;s going to be right .
It &apos;s not going to be _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
And she &apos;s very professional , and she knows what she &apos;s doing .
You know , here &apos;s _UNK_ , it &apos;s a magic place .
Now you &apos;re going to see how we make movies ,
It &apos;s too much to say that the time
I can &apos;t say that I just want to say one thing .
I was with these _UNK_ , and I spent a few weeks
And the problem that they met was that
a Western director , like American or European director , can &apos;t imagine
But they always smile and enthusiasm to face
I need to make movies , like you need oxygen .
And Nigeria &apos;s film makers really do what they like .
So the film is a very important thing to them .
a woman told me , &quot; When I look at a film ,
I can relax , I really breathe more smooth .
And I believe that digital non - linear editing technology has greatly reduced the cost of film production .
The cost of film is a very small part of the past .
We don &apos;t have to tell the story of Nigeria
I hope that the phenomenon can be _UNK_
I hope that other African countries can be inspired
in Nigeria , to take movies , create jobs ,
for their own people to make their own stories .
But I think the _UNK_ phenomena can give us _UNK_
My film producer friends , and they see _UNK_ ,
Wow , what they do is we really want to do
to make some money , to make a movie living .
One thing , I &apos;ll give you a little challenge
It allows us to _UNK_ the importance of stories .
I think this is the theme of this talk .
trying to imagine a food and shelter is the only goal , no story .
I think the keys to a healthy society
And I think Nigeria &apos;s film producer _UNK_ that this is
It &apos;s not the sequel , just some sounds from the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is the best thing to do with them .
If there &apos;s a industry that can make people smile ,
And I thought , well , we don &apos;t only have better films .
But we &apos;re talking about these stories , Nigeria , Africa ,
We have _UNK_ culture , which is so diverse ,
I don &apos;t think we can probe these stories
My job is _UNK_ . The film producer needs to work .
I really hope there will be a lot of work in the future .
_UNK_ , you say _UNK_ is the third largest film industry in the world .
So what is the idea of the movie number ?
_UNK_ : Yeah , I just mentioned in front of it , about _UNK_ movies .
And so it &apos;s going to be certain that
the quality needs to be increased , they have to go higher .
_UNK_ : These are not the movies that are _UNK_ in the movie ?
_UNK_ : Yeah , of course , this is important .
If you think about it , think about it ,
These are the movies that are distributed in the market .
No , the form , right , thank you for your question , is _UNK_ .
is a CD , but it &apos;s more compressed .
They don &apos;t actually wait for the latest technology .
_UNK_ : So is the movie selling on the street ?
_UNK_ : You may be in a row in the _UNK_ .
You may buy a movie , or a banana , a _UNK_ . Yes .
And I have to say that this is true .
And what I &apos;m going to show you is that
are related to reality , for customers to solve problems .
or I convinced the clients that I finally helped them solve the problem .
I don &apos;t want you to see what I &apos;m doing here .
In fact , it appeared in a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit
And I tried to build a building for the background ,
And when people take these buildings out of this scene ,
And my theory is that they are more suitable
I &apos;m going to start creating a comfortable , personal and quiet space ,
as the slide on the right is showing .
And then I designed the law at the _UNK_ Center .
What I &apos;m concerned about is how to design appropriate space for legal studies .
The building in _UNK_ is now building
on the right garage -- the gray structure -- will eventually be _UNK_ .
These are all related to customers and students .
They first met that they felt the space _UNK_
So all of our ideas is to create a _UNK_
And in the middle of the city , there &apos;s an _UNK_ environment
And my theory , or the point of view
I tried to _UNK_ and put the buildings around us
In the &apos; 60s , I began to design paper furniture
Some of the things I made in the &apos; _UNK_ &apos; &apos; 80s
We even made the floor , _UNK_ and other things .
The success of the furniture made me a surprise .
And I was unable to accept that success
So I did it , and I started making no furniture .
And that &apos;s the way that the furniture is ,
_UNK_ and I did a piece of furniture
and finally became the one on the right .
There was a _UNK_ to help us do things .
He _UNK_ a piece of clay together
I wrapped the tape around and put it together .
And as you can see , I realized that it was possible
And it &apos;s got to be _UNK_ and flexible .
And I thought , I was really annoyed with _UNK_ .
I said that fish had been bigger than human beings .
If you think about it , then it &apos;s going to go back to the beginning ,
And the more they evolved , the bigger they are ,
And then I took it all the way around .
about the knowledge of form and motion ,
and a lot of the ideas that are produced
And that &apos;s what I call an intuition , and I follow it .
I submitted a project about a building , just a solution .
And after the contract , someone took me out to dinner .
I love Japan &apos;s sake and the _UNK_ beef .
And after I got drunk -- I had to drink drunk --
Some of you have me _UNK_ the paper
I often draw objects and _UNK_ style ,
So I did a fish and I left Japan
After three weeks , I received a complete set of drawings
Now the challenge is . The shape of the fish is hard to translate
In _UNK_ , one of my colleagues who worked with me
and told me that was _UNK_ , and that was more exciting .
But he &apos;s right -- I don &apos;t know how to deal with the tail .
I started doing a good thing , but I didn &apos;t know how to do it .
The one on the right is a _UNK_ object , a pyramid
I put them together , and people can walk in the middle
They don &apos;t show the background , so you think
But one of my friends turned around four hours
and the technology and technology and so on .
And what you &apos;re talking about is that it &apos;s amazing to me
We use _UNK_ to make a fantastic computer
We made some bubble models , and we scan it .
We did the _UNK_ of fish and fish .
When we got there , everything was going to work well .
So I decided to turn my head and tail
I did this on the left , put me on the _UNK_ Center ,
I think this is one of the most beautiful works I &apos;ve done .
and invited me to design a building in Los Angeles
because of the reasons I don &apos;t want to say , that &apos;s okay .
toxic waste , I guess it &apos;s the main reason
So we built a temporary building -- I &apos;m getting more and more _UNK_ .
in the middle of the room in _UNK_
And Jay took me to my own hometown , Canada ,
There &apos;s a story -- a real story -- about my grandmother .
and put it in the _UNK_ , and I was a kid ,
and go to bed , and the next day the fish had gone .
This is the interior of my office for _UNK_ .
He didn &apos;t buy a sculpture , so I did one .
I found a _UNK_ in Toronto with my grandmother .
A few years ago , we did an act in Italy
_UNK_ , but the two children are my son .
He &apos;s a _UNK_ businessman , but he wants to _UNK_
to be dressed in a building that was designed
And the point of the show is that
I can tell you -- this is all done .
And the only thing I did was I did ,
I can turn the blade to make it possible
You know , I used the wire and so on .
I chose this because of the curious _UNK_ of culture
And I was in this case , like paper furniture --
So I did a lot of bad things with chains
But _UNK_ allowed it to be used in _UNK_ _UNK_
And we designed a school to give cancer children
You can see , we &apos;re starting to design
like a _UNK_ -- like a _UNK_ painting ,
It looks like we can work together
And Jay _UNK_ wanted me to design this building
In this place of _UNK_ , I began to design these three things .
Jay asked me how I was going to deal with architecture
And one day I had a idea -- well , the other idea
I put the _UNK_ telescope there in there ,
And then I didn &apos;t take them anymore .
And when he gave me the first model
to make the whole thing more interesting .
I still think the picture of the magazine will be this telescope .
I use a lot of metal in my work
I &apos;m going to get the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
And I said , &quot; I can &apos;t get what I want to do
to make beautiful art and sculpture with _UNK_ material .
I made a metal because it was used
and the metal can do the roofs and make a wall .
I have a chance to design a show
is to work for _UNK_ metal workers in Washington ,
And I &apos;m doing this , and they become my future partner .
and help me do all the metal buildings and so on .
is that it &apos;s interesting to build a metal building
is a communication , at least one person
Part of the communication of the people who are very important
The metal continues to be used in architecture -- _UNK_ Miller ,
_UNK_ Miller has a philosophy of _UNK_ Miller .
And this is what it looks like to be old .
But they wanted to have a central area
There &apos;s a _UNK_ room that &apos;s good for you .
So this project wasn &apos;t in the village , and you &apos;re close to it .
The specifications are small , so it &apos;s easy to bend .
I spent a lot of time _UNK_ Richard &apos;s _UNK_ ,
And I tried to make them dirty and fuzzy ,
The little dome is designed by the _UNK_ .
And at the beginning of my work ,
I asked the client to do this field with me .
because this is what we &apos;re talking about .
Maybe this is a metaphor for the city .
And we &apos;re using the phone and fax ,
He gave the fax of his design
He made a _UNK_ building and a small tower
So I decided to give him a little bit
I designed a hole to give him a building
So he designed two bridge -- it &apos;s all in fax .
and it &apos;s going to change it in a few weeks .
So he designed two _UNK_ _UNK_ bridges ,
And then I put this big sign on the back ,
The left hand is the old building of Boston .
This is a famous building on the road .
We went to a floor and cleaned it up .
and using a certain kind of -- I thought -- a _UNK_ architecture language
My design is a little bit _UNK_ , but I use _UNK_
This beautiful material will change in 100 years .
_UNK_ the window size to fit the space
And it was amazing to get Boston and us
because the design of Boston is very strict .
And they often think that my design is not satisfied .
We are very carefully _UNK_ on the details of lead .
on the _UNK_ side of the _UNK_ .
and then designed to be a building , and they built this building
I was sitting on the plane for the night .
But they _UNK_ the size of my model a third .
And then the metal and chain , this is in the United States ,
This is a laser lab at the University of _UNK_
There &apos;s a abstract image of fish in this project , behind the building ,
This is an accident that we don &apos;t need to go to the lab .
The part of the curve is that all mechanical devices
And the front wall is a _UNK_ _UNK_ --
So I grabbed the opportunity of getting this opportunity
because this form doesn &apos;t need any _UNK_ or opening .
And this gives me a chance to make a sculpture .
They &apos;ve been so long that I &apos;ve forgotten where it is .
along the stream -- built a dam --
And that reminds me why I am so _UNK_
This metal is a channel that is going to go .
You walk into the living room and go to the bedroom .
I was asked to design a spiritual _UNK_ hospital
I think it &apos;s going to be the right thing to do .
This is a house at the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
There &apos;s a contradiction in the room -- they &apos;re going to make PR .
We have to do it at the end , because the contradiction is that
How do you build a building that looks like buildings ?
Or is this beautiful park that looks like being _UNK_ ?
And finally , what we &apos;re going to do
in the direction of the _UNK_ , all the _UNK_ are _UNK_ .
When you walk around the building , it looks very _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ wall is made of metal , brown and _UNK_ .
We don &apos;t have to go to the church again .
In this project we understand how to deal with this material ,
You know the lake , you can see these new buildings that we built
And we had the opportunity to build a building on the _UNK_ .
Here &apos;s the town , and this is the court .
The railway station in _UNK_ was not built .
We &apos;ve extended this axis , this building is kind of a _UNK_ .
the headquarters of a insurance company --
We work with _UNK_ , put the folded newspaper on top of the building
The space at the bottom is the museum .
and the _UNK_ of a _UNK_ car .
The owners have a great deal about the bad _UNK_ .
So we retain the axis of the original idea
And the scale of these new buildings can make it work .
The building is built with _UNK_ , _UNK_ Green , and so on .
This is a very old project . It &apos;s about _UNK_ .
A village made by a _UNK_ and a few _UNK_ around it .
The owners of the land have worked for me
And I was a little bit more _UNK_
And she asked me to design a residential building
I _UNK_ the whole building through the cutting _UNK_ .
And what you see in this photograph
in the _UNK_ , and then put the bathroom and the bathroom
_UNK_ the _UNK_ , creating a _UNK_ in the _UNK_ bedroom .
It &apos;s got to be like the _UNK_ ship
If you sleep in this bedroom , I hope
And I was going to sleep at that point
But she said that I didn &apos;t use that .
How many of you feel like in a boat
around the landscape to create a private garden .
And there &apos;s a garden here in the living room .
I don &apos;t know how to solve it .
Well , you go into a garden with a beautiful _UNK_ .
a room , with a marble _UNK_ roof ,
And then you go into the living room , and you get into the room ,
And you get from the _UNK_ down the stairs .
And then you go into the bedroom , and then you go to the lake ,
and create better _UNK_ in this _UNK_ area .
The material is similar to lead copper , and before Boston ,
So our goal is to make this land
100 feet wide , into a big park .
And the way is to take the _UNK_ zone
I don &apos;t know how to do it ,
and looked out like I had a free _UNK_ painting
My notion is that the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
and finally form the _UNK_ -- the _UNK_ --
You think it &apos;s kind of like in your own village .
In California , this is a building on the highway .
You start with the bridge at 65 miles an hour
And you &apos;re going to walk through these rooms
on the back of the building is much human .
And this thing -- hopefully you drive through
The sound of the _UNK_ on these sections
a furniture company , a office office building ,
These are early attempts , the problem is they sell furniture
So if my architecture was so glamorous ,
people would say that their furniture looks still in their house .
But in my ordinary house it seems to be sure that it doesn &apos;t work .
And so in the second stage , it was a simple _UNK_ .
And then we designed the meeting as a _UNK_ .
And so the public space can be _UNK_ .
from the office to look at the past ,
the Minister -- from the _UNK_ -- moved into this room
the Minister -- from the _UNK_ -- moved into this room
We designed a high density in the U.S.
There &apos;s a theater , an apartment , dance school and a art museum .
And there &apos;s a restaurant -- in a short range of density ,
The French are very good at _UNK_ things .
like to cut this beautiful site and cut it off .
like to cut this beautiful site and cut it off .
And this is the way I _UNK_ myself .
I tried to avoid this _UNK_ -- how do I do it ?
And these are the models that I did
And the one on the left is pretty bad .
You can see why this scheme was built , I thought ,
But at the end of this scheme , there was a solution
And this valley , set up the balcony and the _UNK_ ,
like a ballet _UNK_ her skirt to get me into the hall .
in this room -- the apartment and the theater ,
These are going to be made of stone , French _UNK_ ,
And my idea is to show the _UNK_ of architecture
It &apos;s going to be more normal on the side of the street .
except for me to move some of the roofs
These residential units make a certain gesture in the corner .
And this is going to be a kind of _UNK_ .
If any of you have a design idea of it ,
Jay Jay is a guy who likes _UNK_ , so he hired me
for him to design this house in _UNK_
I always tell myself that this is the last fish .
I &apos;m not going to do this again -- I don &apos;t want to do it again .
And I added that because we had enough budget
This is Europe Disney , all of the things I showed before .
I think it &apos;s _UNK_ for them , and it &apos;s for me .
Tony _UNK_ did the hotel that was done
This is a shopping center in the center .
What I did -- because the sky in Paris is rather dry .
I designed a vertical light grid on the railway station .
and then _UNK_ them into the form of _UNK_ .
This is going to be bright at night .
In Switzerland -- actually Germany -- in the _UNK_ River ,
We designed a _UNK_ and a furniture museum
I tried to -- this is the building of _UNK_ design .
I don &apos;t have a good slide to show -- this project &apos;s just done --
But the building , and the pieces of these
When you go through it -- you see these clips
And if this design looks like this crazy picture ,
I &apos;m a _UNK_ and wise -- the interior is so quiet .
It &apos;s a little bit _UNK_ from outside it .
From the back of the building , it looks like
Look , the light on the right side is the picture on the left .
And this is the Disney _UNK_ Hall .
It responds to love and tears and attention
It &apos;s not a nice building , but I &apos;m going to close it
to create a relationship between us and how we are .
And on the plane -- this is a concert hall .
This is the hall , like a garden .
These are all associated with the building of _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s connected to the Museum of California .
And we found that this was not going to work .
But everybody likes this form and its space
And this is the problem of the competition .
You have to figure out how to get your plan
And this is the _UNK_ three _UNK_ buildings
But it set up as much as a number of other things .
And when we met with new experts , he told me
And the shape is right , that shape is very appropriate .
We tried to make a lot of shapes , and we wanted to make the initial _UNK_ .
through a _UNK_ form that can be accepted ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ , acoustic experts say this is important .
And then it turns out that there was no point
Our concept is to make the _UNK_ structure full of _UNK_ .
using wooden materials , like a _UNK_ in the _UNK_ room ,
The advantage of the _UNK_ is , whether you sit there ,
They all give you a sense of a living stage .
This is not the final design -- it &apos;s still changing .
So , in addition to this space , the other details are not so important .
They reflect the laser to see how the design is _UNK_ .
But you can understand the extent of the music hall .
And so it &apos;s formed a very different shape .
So the line is _UNK_ , and the field is very good .
When you put it into a _UNK_ , it &apos;s harder to see --
This is the _UNK_ I designed for _UNK_ .
But this is the way I work , I choose a clip
And of course it doesn &apos;t look like this .
But this is the way I work crazy .
Finally , this is Los Angeles , I was invited to design a sculpture
It was the top building in Los Angeles ,
They let me design a fish so I designed a snake .
This is a public space . I made a similar garden building .
This is a half underground hall , Larry designed some _UNK_ here .
In _UNK_ , I was designing a fish that we were designing
And this is the design of the _UNK_
The design of the _UNK_ _UNK_ adopts _UNK_ steel structure .
So we use this kind of _UNK_ architecture
and then _UNK_ it into a fish .
to create this kind of mechanical thing in the 19th century --
This is the shore , and it &apos;s open to port .
This is actually a shopping center for the department .
At first , this is a _UNK_ entity .
And then we cut it into a bridge
We showed the people who showed the hotel
They &apos;re all frightened to say that because the fish
At the end , I lost this design to _UNK_
But this is the architecture that I was designing
A little studio , sorry , was the building sold .
This is what I did with my son .
He designed this robot that could move as a _UNK_ .
and the food is better than that , so the restaurant is _UNK_ .
This should be something that is better than the food .
I haven &apos;t been used to live in such a way
I want to talk to you about one of my favorites .
I think it &apos;s the most exciting project I &apos;m doing now .
This project is likely to affect the world .
It can solve one of the most serious health problems in the world .
The question is the first number of children dying next five years .
It &apos;s not right , it &apos;s the kitchen _UNK_ .
that leads to acute respiratory infections , do you believe ?
Why can this problem kill _UNK_ people every year ?
This is a picture of a _UNK_ country , where there &apos;s no forest covered .
The entire island is all over the _UNK_ .
There was no _UNK_ in the mountains to _UNK_ the soil .
So once it rained , the water _UNK_ directly through the river , causing flood
And there &apos;s no trees in this room because
And so people made it into charcoal ,
It &apos;s not a matter of protecting the environment .
They understand that the environment is important , but they don &apos;t want to go anywhere .
It &apos;s not a very good thing to do .
You can see a family going to the forest
chopped up the tree and made it _UNK_ .
to find the use of this fuel
Four years ago , I went to _UNK_ with a group of students
And in his village he invented this _UNK_ ,
is to take the waste paper out of it .
and compress it into a lump of wood
We &apos;ve got a _UNK_ student to make it better .
It &apos;s going to increase the efficiency of three times .
And they were very excited at the time .
And then they took them back to MIT ,
And it turns out that these things don &apos;t burn .
And the students were so disappointed that they had
If you look at it , here &apos;s the place ,
because there was no waste paper in that village
It might be a good thing to deal with government _UNK_ .
to get the _UNK_ to the village
So we &apos;re going to figure out the better way
And we want this new kind of fuel
that are going to be able to get out of it .
And there &apos;s a little scale around the _UNK_ .
which is the rest of the sugar _UNK_ ,
This is a _UNK_ , and it &apos;s not a _UNK_ value .
they took the sugar _UNK_ in the _UNK_ , and they finally got _UNK_ .
And we &apos;re going to think about it .
and the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
to make the fuel that everyone can use .
In the next few years , I and my students are developing the right process
First of all , we put the _UNK_ into a _UNK_
The stove was so cold that it could be _UNK_
And then we burn it , and we burn it a little while later ,
don &apos;t let the air go into the air ,
and finally made this kind of material
and it &apos;s going to be done for a second .
So we &apos;re going to try to compress it up .
In fact , one of my students was _UNK_ ,
And remember his mother gave him the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s a very _UNK_ piece of burning
And so we went around and looked for
and found that _UNK_ had been planted , but it was just different .
In fact , there are many places in the world
And although the name is all different , East is the same .
And you can paste it with a _UNK_ .
And then I &apos;m going to use this charcoal .
And we did that . And then we went to _UNK_
And these graduate students are the first ones
Yeah , so I was a professor at MIT and a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Now we go to Asia and look at India .
This is the most common cooking fuel in India --
And the _UNK_ is still worse than the _UNK_ .
You see , the health problem is that
is because of burning _UNK_ or other organisms .
because they often _UNK_ around the kitchen
We want to see if we can introduce
It &apos;s not a _UNK_ , but it &apos;s hard to get us .
We &apos;re still going to be able to get them out there .
And the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ are made of fuel .
We did some comparisons , and you can see
It was obvious that there was a lot of _UNK_
and it &apos;s going to be a lot faster .
and it &apos;s much more expensive than it does .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So the heat is _UNK_ , and it &apos;s very hard to get rid of it .
we tried to make the burning brick more _UNK_ .
so that the charcoal competition on the _UNK_ market
And we went back to MIT , and we found that the _UNK_
and how much of it can be used
and you can compress the _UNK_ out of it .
is going to have a kind of _UNK_
On one hand , my students were studying in the lab
On one hand , _UNK_ community partners also work with us .
trying to improve the _UNK_ and make everyone use
We &apos;ve invented _UNK_ _UNK_ , which is new products .
than the average charcoal burning more and more _UNK_ .
And so we &apos;re going to have a moment
much better than the charcoal on the _UNK_ market .
only a _UNK_ tree is cut down every year .
In addition , this new charcoal can produce $ _UNK_ per year .
And this is a big one of the things
The income is not about 400 dollars per capita .
So we wanted to continue this charcoal project in _UNK_
And one of the things that &apos;s interesting is that
I have a friend in Berkeley as a risk study .
And he studied the health of the health
you can have a million people in the world .
It was all needed to do the charcoal .
to make agriculture waste for cooking fuel .
I learned a message in Ghana last month
And the more simple ones that are on the front side of the technology
If you can imagine it . That &apos;s the one .
What is this ? This is made of charcoal .
And the good thing is that you don &apos;t need a compressed _UNK_ .
because _UNK_ was a _UNK_ . This is my 100 laptop project .
And this is a little bit of a technology
We &apos;re going to train people how to compress charcoal .
And there &apos;s a lot of _UNK_ to do that .
And this is the most exciting thing in my life .
and I was a little sorry little _UNK_ .
But once you go back , like the first row ,
And I think this is the _UNK_ of _UNK_
_UNK_ the _UNK_ and the things that Robert White said .
And it &apos;s a little bit better than that .
and people use the waste crops that can be used
They could save the money they had bought .
that we &apos;re going to be able to create
So the most exciting thing about this project
I want to see the future of it .
to talk about the future of the future ,
And I think it &apos;s necessary to have
and clearly understood the world that we were in .
I &apos;m not talking about the _UNK_ of our own life .
It &apos;s another world . There are women who spend six hours a day
And it was actually made by the _UNK_ ,
where , even if you do 10 hours a day ,
and it &apos;s only about 60 dollars a month .
where women and children do water all day , for a year ,
The _UNK_ is a collection of all the labor in California .
And it was a full time of water
And if this is India , if you look at it ,
So there &apos;s only a third of the people sitting there
There &apos;s only one who knows how to go online
If you &apos;re a _UNK_ , you have 300 farmers
50 percent of the income is not a dollar .
All of these problems were put in front of us .
that we need to be trained to engineer
a designer , a merchant , an entrepreneur to solve
These are the problems that need to be solved as soon as possible .
Some of the problems that I think are particularly important
One is to look for technology to promote small financial and small businesses
the people who live under the poverty line
through the traditional _UNK_ and _UNK_ to make a living .
In addition , we need to invent new technologies for poor farmers .
We need to think about how to improve efficiency
We need to work with the community
to give them the resources and tools they need .
to solve their problems . This is the best way to do it .
We &apos;re going to create the future , we &apos;re going to start
CA : We &apos;re going to see if there &apos;s no audience asking .
You can &apos;t talk about other things you &apos;ve done at the same time .
Amy Smith : Now we &apos;re going to study
and the low cost of water and water
to help the community maintain the water system
to make them know when their systems work , when they need cleaning and so on .
It &apos;s a great thing to use solar _UNK_ ,
But we also need to increase the efficiency
CA : What is the _UNK_ problem that _UNK_ this technology ?
whether you need entrepreneurs , the risk of capital help
or other things that are going to be done ?
Amy Smith : Well , this needs a lot of people
It &apos;s hard , because the market is very _UNK_ .
So the business model of the United States
And we went to _UNK_ , and I was a _UNK_ .
So I and my students will do what we can do .
We have 30 students in this field of research
how to apply and _UNK_ these technologies
In addition , these things are the long-term engineering
It &apos;s impossible to get into the next day .
And this is going to take a couple of years
But I believe that if we are confident we can succeed
In my opinion , school lunch is a big thing about social fair .
And I had 90 employees in my staff
The purpose of doing this is to change our children in our country ,
This is what I want to tell you today .
Now you see the photographs of the kids in the salad bar .
I set up a salad bar in all school .
And the big kids are going to spit in it , but in fact they are both _UNK_ .
When I took this position , I tried to figure out something ,
What should we do to change the relationship between children and food ?
I don &apos;t want to say why we need to change ,
The _UNK_ relations between the three men are _UNK_ .
If we don &apos;t do that , the opposite will be ,
And the reason for this phenomenon is that in general ,
and the U.S. Agriculture Food into the channel of children .
And we all know that we have children ,
This is part of the children &apos;s learning in school . It &apos;s the key question .
We &apos;re going to take this step to the _UNK_ of agricultural enterprises .
In short , we live in a country where most of us have no power to decide what we eat ,
the big financial groups that produce _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
They control 90 percent of the _UNK_ seeds in America .
It &apos;s not going to be a problem . It &apos;s not a question .
and how to change the food that kids eat ,
I began to focus on the problem that we should _UNK_ the children .
to the local food that is going to happen ,
And the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ ,
And as the fossil fuel is constantly spending ,
And it was time to start thinking about
and began to get kids to eat local food .
At present , most of the university cannot afford organic food ,
The result is that children &apos;s body will become worse and worse .
Now I want to focus on a talk about antibiotic .
and it turns out to lead to disease .
We are faced with problems like _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
When the children are ill , we can &apos;t make a difference .
American agriculture is going to consume _UNK_ pounds a year .
That means that every one of us and our children
It &apos;s as common as our regular bags , so I suppose I have a bag of these days ,
and put the things on the ground ,
This is how we eat our children every year .
the hormone and the _UNK_ open the green light ,
OK , so we &apos;re going to talk about _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
We know that _UNK_ is harmful to each of us .
But this is what the U.S. Agriculture has allowed in food supply .
We don &apos;t believe that their hearts are our biggest benefit .
And the opposite is that it &apos;s sustainable food .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get people to know .
I want to _UNK_ it to the children -- I think this is the most important thing .
and the kids are going to grow healthy ,
but we have to go through the _UNK_ .
In less than 200 years , just a few generations ,
Now we live in a prisoner &apos;s number of other countries ,
to the point that we &apos;re going to get a billion dollars
We and our children will be _UNK_ by disease .
If we don &apos;t teach them what &apos;s good for health ,
What &apos;s going to happen ? Do you know what &apos;s going to happen ?
What &apos;s the effect of our whole medical system ?
is going to be more short than our generation .
in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ in 2000 ,
If this is too close to alert , the disease _UNK_ further ,
Life is short in the generation of their parents .
If they have the right to decide , they will send you to a psychological doctor .
But maybe this is the big thing to do ,
_UNK_ dollars , it makes most children see 10,000 garbage ads a year .
to make advertising for the value of one dollar .
And the result of this will be _UNK_ to children ,
Everybody thought that children should be as much as possible .
What you see is the measure of the American Agriculture Department , a small one .
And here &apos;s the scale of McDonald &apos;s and _UNK_ .
The reason is that the government has taken in the _UNK_ process ,
So why I started to call this a big thing about social justice .
Now , when I tell you what I &apos;m doing in Berkeley , you think ,
&quot; Oh , Berkeley , that &apos;s a good place , in Berkeley , you can do that . &quot;
Well , this is what I saw in two years ago .
This is what we call our children -- _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Only one of the kitchen _UNK_ is a carton of _UNK_ .
The only thing in the kitchen is a device
_UNK_ , because they &apos;re going to come in with canned forms ,
chicken , _UNK_ potato , added _UNK_ chocolate milk ,
And that &apos;s why the government allows them to enter the children .
It &apos;s not a business . Do you know ? It &apos;s not a line .
Now , I don &apos;t know if anybody in this room invented chicken ,
and who decided what a chicken should be long ,
The _UNK_ company did it because there was no chicken in the chicken .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of parents doing that .
And what we &apos;re trying to do is just the opposite .
There is no _UNK_ tree or carrots in the world .
There &apos;s a lot of things that we can do .
This is my hands . I got up every morning ,
to prepare for breakfast for the children ,
and expect our children to become healthy citizens .
or _UNK_ , like we &apos;ve been thinking about it ,
Do you know ? So they &apos;re just going to have disease .
I found out that after I went to Berkeley ,
And people are surprised to what we do ,
It &apos;s very different from their previous practice , and I feel obliged to _UNK_ our practices .
I made these calendar and _UNK_ them to their parents in every house .
From this calendar you can understand our whole activity plan .
Now I &apos;m responsible for all cooking lessons in our university .
to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ curriculum .
There is a lot of food in the above school .
In the classroom I will teach the children about the food .
In _UNK_ , children can taste all kinds of fresh fruits .
The children can grow vegetables . Our _UNK_ are offering fresh food for the children .
If we &apos;re going to change the world ,
So what you see in cooking and classroom
I heard so many , you might know how I got to the U.S. _UNK_ ,
They built the pyramid that allowed me to _UNK_ .
I don &apos;t understand why there is a rainbow on the pyramid .
to the end of the rainbow at the bottom ,
I don &apos;t know how you look at it . I designed a pyramid .
You can find on my website , use English and Spanish language .
It _UNK_ the children to tell the food .
We open cooking lessons , we also set up special cooking classroom in school .
Or two generations , they have a meal in the _UNK_ ,
The other one was eating in the car ,
And there was a nice _UNK_ or a computer ago .
What do children learn ? Where are our families ?
My job is always out of the children . These are some children I met at the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , a group of enlightened teenagers who encourage science to eat .
We &apos;re going to let the kids know
it would be like a _UNK_ for a long time .
There is a _UNK_ in our campus in our campus .
Do you know that these are going to be done at home ,
These are just part of what kids need to know ,
are at the end of our career ,
We have the responsibility for these kids ,
I &apos;ve always been involved in the relationship of private partners .
They are willing to work with us in science ,
They are also willing to extend their business to campus .
is going to be less than five dollars a hour .
Most people spend 10 dollars a hour , 15 dollars ,
And our education system spent five dollars a child &apos;s worth five dollars a hour .
And in the middle of our university , I think ,
And I think that if every student in college
And of course , it &apos;s not just about food ,
And a simple way of doing that is
But you think , if you &apos;re going to get kids to lunch ,
The children were able to rest after lunch ,
You &apos;ll see them run directly on the _UNK_ and run out .
And at noon , they &apos;ve been exhausted and tired .
because the children don &apos;t have any _UNK_ ,
When you meet the children after school , you &apos;ll see them all _UNK_ .
So the only thing to do after lunch is to get kids to school ,
I believe the children must sit down for lunch .
There are two things that are supposed to be cook , but there is no work .
Everybody knows that our money is not ample .
We have to make those academic institutions _UNK_
and _UNK_ the way people teach people about cooking ,
One of the important studies shows that most schools
choose to go to lunch in the morning .
It &apos;s ridiculous to know what we do .
not to let the country go to lunch in the U.S. Agriculture Department ,
And I want to end with some financial figures ,
because I think it &apos;s necessary to let you know it .
The national school plans to take two million dollars a year .
And people would ask , &quot; Oh , my God , are we going to make _UNK_ ? &quot;
In our country , we spend as much as fast food every year
That &apos;s why we need so much weight to lose weight .
and the kids in _UNK_ have two diabetes .
It &apos;s not a big number when you need a dollar .
_UNK_ dollars in the end of two dollars .
Most of the _UNK_ are used to pay wages and management costs .
And that means that we really take lunch every day .
Most schools are 80 cents . In Los Angeles , this number is 56 cents .
It seems that we spend less than a dollar on lunch .
But I went to San Francisco to _UNK_ , Mr. _UNK_ &apos;s restaurant like this ,
The price of the big glass is five dollars .
And in our school , you know , you know ,
They don &apos;t even pay the garbage lunch for school .
Or these children , they need to take care of us .
whether we don &apos;t like children , whether we have _UNK_ or _UNK_ ,
If you sit down and eat with your children ,
Go to the farmer &apos;s market and take a taste of the delicious food .
I &apos;d like to ask you a lot of attention to children &apos;s health . Thank you .
to protect the most important organs in our body : the brain .
We have the sensory muscles , some of our special senses --
is full of light that you see through the skull ,
But imagine that if this is a solid bone ,
We can &apos;t see the world around us .
and our faces have the ability to do it .
This is because we &apos;re attracted by the face .
Now you look at the picture on your left --
And he didn &apos;t look like a picture of his eyebrows .
Imagine if he had hair in the middle of his nose ,
These pictures can only catch a brief moment in our lives .
He didn &apos;t have any _UNK_ , but I took his picture
to show that he looks like a _UNK_ patient .
This is a classic case : _UNK_ is a benign _UNK_ .
from her skull , and _UNK_ her nose ,
that the parents and the people who are close
They &apos;ve been accustomed to these children ; they think these children are special .
is not to remove the recurrence of these children .
there will be such a big change that can &apos;t recognize them .
They would say , &quot; How dare you take the child out of the house
Are you going to do something ? Why don &apos;t you get rid of this ? &quot;
Other kids will be curious about coming up ,
And these kids are going to play more with other kids .
when we work hard to show ourselves in the world .
You spend a lot of time looking at the mirror every day ,
trying to look more like _UNK_ , like I was a kid .
I chose to show you the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
because she could see her _UNK_ forward
I want you to push your _UNK_ forward here ,
to push your _UNK_ forward and turn to your next person
And as all of you tell the _UNK_ .
But you would ask her , &quot; Why are you sad ? &quot;
She was _UNK_ by teachers and students in school .
And the _UNK_ can do that in this way .
The attitude of patients with facial facial muscles was _UNK_ .
So they can &apos;t figure out what the _UNK_ are after surgery --
And we found that these people were _UNK_
It &apos;s not surprising , but we &apos;re going to let them go on
They don &apos;t have to choose the kind of surgery .
is the result of the bad _UNK_ .
that might be cancer or injury or _UNK_ .
And he was going to take a tumor
from his left face -- his _UNK_ bone ,
But next 15 years , he took 14 _UNK_ ,
He was a lawyer . He was still playing the cricket cricket .
It might be because he had a successful job
I &apos;m not saying he _UNK_ the tumor ; he &apos;s not .
But the important thing is that he neglected it .
He neglected the beauty of the face of his face .
He was the first time abroad because of his _UNK_ .
He needs to go to Britain to do a surgery .
for 23 hours . I was a doctor with my _UNK_ .
We took all the bones out of his right face --
He was _UNK_ , and his son was called _UNK_ .
to tell me that I was a successful person . &quot;
So we see that we can change the faces of these people .
We can say that a patient chooses facial muscles --
And this may be the surgical operation of plastic
because you might say , &quot; Well , this surgery
If you do plastic surgery , the disease is usually not satisfied .
And she didn &apos;t want to change life ,
I _UNK_ off the picture so that we still see the blank slide .
This is a young girl in the middle of London .
She &apos;s got a big _UNK_ on her right face ,
And in a hurry , she will kill her in the near future .
Her parents gave her a beautiful green velvet dress ,
They want to see this picture all over the world ,
Only from the photographs came out of the faces of criminals .
We &apos;d like to spend time with him . He looks very friendly .
We think we can judge it from people .
so they can see if there &apos;s any signs of truth --
_UNK_ tells us that only a tenth of a second ,
Do we feel _UNK_ about the scene ? It &apos;s true .
If we had our doctors , the lawyers ,
It &apos;s not about 10 seconds in the _UNK_ , but it &apos;s a five minutes .
maybe you &apos;re bored , you &apos;re not interested in them ,
And then some of you who don &apos;t notice immediately ,
some of the operations that we did --
Her _UNK_ and skull were removed from the bottom .
and they wanted to go outside and _UNK_ ,
They &apos;ve been done , and that &apos;s what we need to do now .
a bank manager of Nigeria , his face ,
He lost his _UNK_ , his lips , the chin ,
And this is what he expects to us .
&quot; I want to look like this . This is what I did . &quot;
We did a _UNK_ model of the _UNK_ .
And then we put the bones and the tissue back .
The _UNK_ is being put into the body --
So the more thick , the color is deeper and rough , and there is no _UNK_ .
But we are still _UNK_ with skin replacement .
But the _UNK_ would need to take it for life .
to _UNK_ their immune systems in the world .
They will be more likely to be infected , and more risk _UNK_ .
like the heart , the liver , the lung transplant --
is that people don &apos;t mean , if they &apos;re 10 years or 15 years later ,
&quot; I &apos;m not going to use this traditional plastic _UNK_ ,
because I &apos;m dying of the _UNK_ now ? &quot; We don &apos;t know .
First of all , trying to do this sort of surgery
and people who have surgery don &apos;t have a lot ,
How many people would like to care about their faces .
I can put it in a place where it should be .
And then you see , four months later , the face is long .
It &apos;s kind of like a little baby cookbook for Julia .
We don &apos;t have enough patients -- this is the worst cancer .
So we can &apos;t _UNK_ what we &apos;re doing .
I &apos;ve been walking around for 20 years --
And the soldiers in Afghanistan saw me _UNK_ .
to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ ,
I found the light and found the _UNK_ in Afghanistan .
to the remote village of the world ,
How many people who live in the Taliban died ?
The area is dangerous , and it &apos;s all over the Taliban .
We can communicate with the rise of the patient
some of the patients who are able to take care of themselves
And they would say , &quot; You know , although I knew it was not enough ,
but I was going to find more information .
And then I was known as the _UNK_ movement --
I used a patient to write a blog .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m not talking about a guy who &apos;s not here ,
Some of the talks today are still in this way .
I see a lot of people _UNK_ , and they say , &quot; I understand you .
So , when you hear what I &apos;m going to talk to you about today ,
I &apos;ve met all the patients that I &apos;ve met
We &apos;re going to let people play a more positive role .
the most _UNK_ resources in the medical industry
is the first time we got to the moon this year .
You and I are now , what we &apos;re living
and no one could expect it to change .
But one of the important components that I &apos;ve been involved in _UNK_ ,
It mentioned how to build their own house ,
how to grow their food , all of these things .
is the journal _UNK_ of the Global _UNK_ .
And the vast majority of the things that are done
In fact , he said that _UNK_ was 80 .
about how we keep our body on our own .
The main part of our _UNK_ is the _UNK_ of information .
When the Internet appears , all of the changes are changed .
He looked more _UNK_ than he was at the time .
In 2006 , I went to find my doctor to do a medical check .
I told him that my shoulder was acid .
You might notice that some of you have experienced health crisis
They can read their dates on their own disease .
I was in the office , and I was in a _UNK_ .
The blue curtains hung on the wall ,
He said , &quot; _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to find the _UNK_ out at home .
I asked him , do you need me to go back and check it ?
He said , &quot; Yes , we &apos;re going to make CT scan in your chest . &quot;
And finally I asked him , what can I do ?
Go home and your wife have a glass of tea .
And I found five _UNK_ in the lung .
And so we decided that I had cancer .
like a lot of women who do _UNK_ ,
But what we see is that this is an MRI image .
is much more clear than the _UNK_ .
and a little bit of a human being .
There is a _UNK_ , a _UNK_ and a _UNK_ .
This is a muscle that I never heard about in the back .
but all of a sudden I started caring about it .
Now I &apos;ve been using Google search , and it &apos;s using _UNK_ Internet .
I went back home and I knew you could not know these details .
I want to say , I went to a _UNK_ medical website ,
cancer , a tumor that comes out of your body .
If I don &apos;t like the first result I get ,
I would feel tired in the evening ,
But for me , this is what the doctor told me to do .
This is a picture of the fourth stage of kidney cancer .
_UNK_ , I have the same thing in my lungs .
In the left side , left _UNK_ , there is another one .
I _UNK_ and fell in my leg , my leg was broken .
In order to describe that I have these other tumors
My _UNK_ moved to my tongue in my tongue .
I know that the average _UNK_ is going to be
I think my mother &apos;s face looks like my funeral .
I said , I don &apos;t want you to get married in the early days .
Just because you want to be married when your father is still alive .
Because if you want to know why people are stimulated ,
a network of cancer patients , there are all kinds of wonderful things .
There &apos;s no treatment , but it &apos;s going to be effective at some time ,
Don &apos;t let them tell you something else about it .
to give this therapy , their telephone number is .
You can &apos;t find a website to tell you this information .
My tumor doctors and I often communicate with this period ,
because I tried to make my talk very precise .
But when it &apos;s a long time in your organization ,
because I founded a site on my own site
My friend , one of my relatives , actually ,
There &apos;s a story about how these are going to happen .
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to take these numbers on my _UNK_ website
is where I took two _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
and see how the size of the tumor is rapidly reduced .
Who can think of what we can do , when we learn how to use one time .
The key is that after a year and a half ,
And in this beautiful woman , my daughter ,
It was like I had only one time with her .
I &apos;m really glad she doesn &apos;t have to say to her mother ,
Now I want to talk about a few other patients ,
They use all the power to improve the medical profession .
Her husband died in _UNK_ , and after a year I had to do it .
And she thought , if I could find it in the packing of my cereal ,
And she realized that there was a lot of people
But you &apos;re hearing these books at the medical conference .
I don &apos;t know how to encourage the patient to have the original data ,
I actually talked about a conference a few years ago ,
because you can &apos;t be trusted to make these data clear .
It began to _UNK_ and began to break through .
In fact , I want to give you some _UNK_ ,
? I want to be a e - patient like a _UNK_ ?
? Give me the dead data , because it needs to be my life ?
than those of you who can make you
I want to say , what do I want to know ?
You can click it in different parts and move it .
I found that _UNK_ , this is a kidney , this is _UNK_ .
But if you can get the data out of the dam ,
Who knows what I can come up with .
because they don &apos;t have to look at the symptoms .
It makes it difficult to understand the condition of disease development .
Some doctors think , ah , you really have a lot of pain .
This is not what he normally does .
So she read it again . She wanted to read it again .
And he said , if you don &apos;t want to abide by my guidance ,
And she looked at the CD of the image ,
You see , this is a patient holding a fate in your hand and no medical training .
is because she can get the original data .
Tim _UNK_ himself , the Internet invention , did a report ,
At the end of the report , he called all the audience .
In New York , I was a nonprofit organization
I was the _UNK_ of an active fire .
in a place where people are successful ,
You have to be a very _UNK_ scene .
and it &apos;s probably going to be able to go into the scene .
But you have to win the rest of the volunteers
She was obviously the worst day in life .
And the other one that I &apos;m going to take the first step
and it &apos;s going to tell people about life .
And he said , &quot; _UNK_ , I need you to _UNK_
I need you to go upstairs and cross the flames .
I need you to take a pair of shoes for this woman . &quot;
_UNK_ up and down to the corridor , through the real _UNK_ ,
and they &apos;ve been able to make a fire
I walked into the main bedroom , and I took the _UNK_ ,
And she talked about a very nice little detail
and even someone gave her a _UNK_ for her ,
I &apos;ve seen a lot of very generous people
And I also witnessed the courage and compassion
whether it &apos;s going to be able to supply food
It &apos;s not the opportunity we all have every day .
But every day we have the opportunity to influence life
Now , one billion people are _UNK_ in the dilemma ,
the economy of the world is still _UNK_ ,
So , what &apos;s really going on is this : can we do it ?
_UNK_ : How should we give a good prospects for people ?
For me , this is the main road to _UNK_ the current development .
I &apos;m going to teach you a recipe for you now ,
This is the combination of two kinds of positive forces ,
They are the alliance of compassion and _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , because of a billion people in the world today
So what does it mean to the one billion people ?
What do we do last time ? The richest world
And this is a very good clue ,
Of course , you have to go back to a long time ago .
The rich world was _UNK_ to change another area .
And the areas that need to develop are us , Europe .
It &apos;s not just compassion for Europe , but it &apos;s true .
At the end of the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ countries are _UNK_
The Soviet camp , so you can only do that .
So what do you do last time ?
Right , you &apos;ve done a big aid plan . Thank you very much .
That &apos;s the _UNK_ aid plan ; we need to do it again . aid is one of the ways .
You have completely abandoned the original trade policy , and the new is completely _UNK_ .
And after World War , you open the market to Europe ,
You know , the global economy of Europe , is your dominant ,
It was achieved by the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
Before the Second World War , your safety policy is _UNK_ .
After the Second World War , you &apos;re back to Europe , and you &apos;ve done 100,000 _UNK_ ,
In World War II , you think the sovereignty is so sacred ,
So you don &apos;t want to join the international coalition .
the OECD , the International Fund of _UNK_ ,
You _UNK_ the European community to establish a community .
And of course , the details will change ,
so that a billion people can meet the catch .
We need at least one of those _UNK_ and attitudes .
And today , I &apos;m going to take four choices .
I &apos;m going to choose the effect of the _UNK_ ,
And that was the mother and the mother
This idea will tell you how to _UNK_ government management ,
This is an important part of the world today .
to get the one billion people to benefit ,
The prosperity of the goods is going to be _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
A lot , but not all , a billion people in the country .
They put money into these countries because the price of the goods is high ,
But it &apos;s not full . In those countries they &apos;ve found a series of resources .
Uganda was just found in _UNK_ , and that was the most _UNK_ place on Earth ;
New Guinea is found to find rich iron ore resources .
_UNK_ can benefit $ 2 million per year from petroleum .
In the last year , one billion people in 60 countries offered only $ _UNK_ million .
And so the prosperity of the goods will be
But the question is how do we help them develop ?
So , I did a little bit of research on this question ,
I went to see the price of the expensive commodity exports .
I &apos;m looking at the global perspective , and I &apos;m going to have all the countries around the world ,
From the short term -- maybe the first five to seven years -- they &apos;re good .
Because the rise of trade , you make profits that you make ,
but it &apos;s also going to be all _UNK_ .
And so the GDP became well -- well ! But that &apos;s just a short term .
although you can accelerate the short term , most of the society ,
From the history of history , all the _UNK_ results are almost _UNK_ .
This is not the prediction of the price of commodities ;
but the prediction of the long-term outcome ,
So what &apos;s wrong ? Why would there be _UNK_ ?
So I did this again and I showed that
The key problem is that when the resource develops ,
And this is the _UNK_ of the long term .
That was Norway , the richest country in Europe . It was Australia , Canada .
And what they did was they had a very fast crash .
But the problem is that they can keep this _UNK_ .
From history , their government was as _UNK_ as 40 years ago .
In Nigeria , if they don &apos;t mining oil , their situation should be better .
So , for those countries that can go into a long way ,
_UNK_ was in the middle of the _UNK_ in the &apos; 80s .
So the question became , is these countries going to be _UNK_ or _UNK_ ?
since the advent of the commodity in the 1970s ,
And so I think that this is the government
Perhaps because of democracy , we can hold this optimistic attitude .
the idea of democracy is actually going to be obvious --
The trouble with democracy is more difficult than _UNK_ .
In this stage , I &apos;m going to give up research , but --
-- the _UNK_ of democracy is not only limited to that .
the election competition , decided how do you go to the top ,
_UNK_ , you decide how you use the power .
that have come up with a negative effect .
The strong _UNK_ can lead to the prosperity of the goods .
And so what the countries need is that
How should we help them strengthen the authority and _UNK_ the system ?
We should build some of the international standards ,
should be controlled , but also should be explained at the same time .
It &apos;s easy to do that , that &apos;s what the government needs .
Nigeria &apos;s _UNK_ accepted the scheme and published tax on the newspaper immediately after the departure .
The people are eager to know their government
So we know it &apos;s effective . But what should the international rule be ?
I don &apos;t have time to do it , just give you an example .
The first one is how to take the resources out --
This is a economic process that will be picked up .
So the first step is to sell the resources .
You all know that resources are sold at the moment ,
But in the past 40 years , how are they sold ?
a company in _UNK_ and dealing with the Minister ,
So , it was a profitable choice --
in all the public institutions on the planet , the greatest professional
Of course , the finance ministry -- the British ministry are the _UNK_ .
The British Finance Department decided to _UNK_ certain powers
They calculated that these powers were worth two hundred pounds .
At the same time , a group of economists proposed
and said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you have a auction ? This will show the value of these things . &quot;
If the British ministry of finance can reach 10 _UNK_ ,
So think about what &apos;s going on in Sierra _UNK_ .
And when I submitted this proposal to Sierra _UNK_ ,
And the President was like the World Bank ,
If we can do that , we &apos;re going to change the world .
And we can help those who are _UNK_ ,
This is our duty . We can &apos;t change the society ,
But we can help the _UNK_ change the society ,
If you think about it , if you _UNK_ the international rules ,
_UNK_ always act as a gesture , not doing practical things ,
_UNK_ is just a _UNK_ for Africa :
And I realized that we had to have
And this is the rule that I took away all the economists
A work of economics that can read on the beach has been written .
But I had to say , I had to talk to you about
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m standing on this stage , but it &apos;s _UNK_ .
My wife showed me a comment on my talk ,
And this blog says , &quot; _UNK_ is not glamorous --
And you agree that we need a society and a group of people ,
I was not going to be able to do that .
And I decided to go on the artist ,
but it &apos;s going to be a heavy piece of bronze .
It &apos;s not only going to be able to see
There are _UNK_ and half of the hand _UNK_
to make it stand at the center of the traffic station
My life was changed from the time .
This is the square , and I thought we needed sculpture
And the people who took it would not be _UNK_ .
to look at the subway in the surface .
And this is like the X ray of the system .
in the Western world and their _UNK_ ,
and ask them if they could give the tsunami ,
I can &apos;t rely on _UNK_ , build this sculpture in my original way .
not as part of the city fabric ( translator ) : there are two meanings : _UNK_ ;
And I got a call from New York City
Now , I &apos;m going to combine it with high tech materials and engineering
I got a phone call from Phoenix ,
and let you lie in the bottom of the sculpture ,
And then I was working in _UNK_ . I realized
I &apos;d like to take the color camera
And the key thing is that through photography
and I took pictures of the big industrial landscape ,
because the change is the speed of our resources .
So I took a whole series of oil landscape .
I &apos;m going to make a series of topics .
The first theme is that oil mining and _UNK_ .
The second major _UNK_ is how we use it :
The third theme is the end of the oil .
and all of the cars , the tires ,
all of this _UNK_ landscape of _UNK_ ?
For me , photography is my way to find these places .
He calculated how much carbon he needed to spend on a petrol .
I thought it would cost a lot of carbon .
I know that oil comes from the sea _UNK_ .
He also calculated how long the earth needed to generate these energy .
_UNK_ depends on the effect of _UNK_ to grow energy per year .
It also _UNK_ the crisis of our society .
and the Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Arabia .
They are added to the ground for 15 years .
The problem is not whether oil peak is coming , but when it comes .
I think it should be the biggest challenge to deal with our talents .
I think it should be the biggest challenge to deal with our talents .
I think it should be the biggest challenge to deal with our talents .
And on the other hand , on the other hand ,
30 years later I could say to my children , &quot;
30 years later I could say to my children , &quot;
Now is the most important moment in our time .
Hey , everyone is like me to raise your hands back and forth .
Like me , a bit like the royal _UNK_ waved to the people .
You can arrange a hundred muscles in your arm .
and you can see how you work in your brain ,
_UNK_ , controls all kinds of _UNK_ in the brain .
We &apos;ve been thinking about the interior of the mind for thousands of years .
We have the opportunity to achieve it in the years of this technology .
because you have to _UNK_ the space shuttle into the human blood vessels .
You may be attacked by the white cell in the artery .
But now we really have this technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to go into the mind of my colleague Peter .
Don &apos;t put anything into the body . You don &apos;t need to risk radiation .
in the _UNK_ structure of Peter &apos;s brain , _UNK_ his body .
But more importantly , we can see his mind running .
When Peter wave his arm , you can see the yellow dot .
is where Peter is going to work in the brain .
You &apos;ve seen it before , you can control the _UNK_ arm ,
The brain imaging and _UNK_ can show that your brain is inside .
The latest progress is that the program usually takes a few days or even a few months .
and when _UNK_ can see their brain operating at the same time .
He can see the _UNK_ of these _UNK_ in a second .
If he can see how he works in his head , he can learn how to control it .
There are three ways to influence the brain :
You will soon have a fourth different way .
We all know that our ideas form from inner and brain .
_UNK_ pain is an example . If you reach yourself at once .
But if you &apos;ve been back for six months or six years ,
This is because the circuitry of these neural circuitry has no help for you .
If we can look at the activity of the brain ,
we can make 3D models and look at the way the brain works ,
we can figure out the area of pain .
Put your arm behind and make the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Now , imagine you &apos;re going to see the interior of your brain
and choose the block of the brain to do the same thing .
What you see is the brain that we &apos;ve found a chronic pain patient .
Perhaps you feel incredible , but we are now _UNK_ and read the human brain .
and they control the way they get suffering .
They are learning to regulate the path so that they don &apos;t have to take _UNK_ .
And the upper left is what they &apos;re doing .
The way to _UNK_ the pain of their brain .
When they control their brains , they can control their pain .
But in clinical trials we see chronic pain reduced to 64 .
It &apos;s not a _UNK_ mission . It &apos;s only your own control .
I &apos;ve seen my brain inside , and you can quickly get it .
When you can control your brain , what do you want to control ?
You will be able to understand all aspects of your personality and your experience .
Some _UNK_ are still working on , and I have no time to talk about it today .
But I &apos;d like to ask you a big question .
We &apos;re the first generation to go into the interior of the brain ,
and the concept of evil and evil ,
is that science is not going to solve and engage .
but never tells us what is important to us .
So most people , even today , sit here ,
that science would never be able to answer
to _UNK_ the science and the values of human values .
is not the basis of moral and values .
And the truth and value seem to be two different levels .
and you can &apos;t take us to _UNK_ .
is how humans can get the _UNK_ of life .
Why do we have no moral requirements for rock ?
because we don &apos;t think that rock is going to be _UNK_ .
We are much more concerned about our species .
That &apos;s because we think we &apos;re more than insects
And the middle is that it &apos;s wrong to be wrong .
And that means that we can live in the heart of insects
Even if you think it &apos;s good for evil ,
And these are still different kinds of feelings .
that these experiences are going to continue to die ,
And although no one knows how the world is going to die ,
We know that some of the facts have been there
We know that you might live in a _UNK_ country
and all of these things can be wrong .
people don &apos;t find a consensus that peace is safe .
We know that we can solve these problems for a long time ,
And as we now , _UNK_ and peace are talking about
Is it right to join cholera virus in the water ?
Everybody believes that the _UNK_ of evil eye
When we talk about value , we &apos;re talking about the fact
The world &apos;s current can be seen in many different ways .
But if we go back to the issue of happiness ,
We have to talk about the human brain
because we know what we think about the world , our experience and perception
Even with the _UNK_ bomb , you can get 72 _UNK_
in a way that science is known as a _UNK_ .
to change the experience of these people .
And this is like a moral landscape .
And maybe this experience is what we call
Maybe some of the things that we can &apos;t experience
I have to be clear , I &apos;m not saying ,
or science can answer all of the things
For example , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be
One day we &apos;re going to talk about computer , we &apos;re not going to have a second baby .
or to be at TED , not to report money
They &apos;re the answer , whatever we can &apos;t get ,
when we tried to solve the problems of happiness
For example , there are 21 states in the United States
The teacher can use the legal boards
to _UNK_ kids , _UNK_ , and even _UNK_ ,
And I think you &apos;ll be surprised , what is the provinces .
And religion is often the reason for these things
This is the 13 chapters of the Old Testament , and 23 .
If this is true , because the concept of health
As Michael _UNK_ said , these concepts will change .
Maybe one day , because we have a study of genes
It &apos;s not going to be able to run a _UNK_
is that there &apos;s a kind of disabled
If you have this situation , people will give you
We know that health is going to change .
is the same thing in science or theory .
The other thing to notice is that it &apos;s a lot of peak
to find a way to manage the social world
I &apos;m never going to argue with you ,
We should have the freedom to eat .
to study the _UNK_ , to find more facts
So for example , a liar is a _UNK_ .
And this is not really a moral thing .
In some times , Queen was a very beautiful play .
In certain times , that &apos;s the only thing you can do
But chess is a absolutely objective game .
is that the exception of the chess game
And in this moral spirit , you know ,
Some of the things that we should do
And there &apos;s a way to do that
And in general , our academic circles are like this .
How can we say that they are _UNK_
If they refuse to be treated like this ?
Or should we remain neutral to this kind of behavior ?
I &apos;m not talking about the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
I think women should want to wear anything .
What kind of society is , what does _UNK_ mean ?
to get these things that are moving into your brain :
And what you do is you kill her .
I &apos;m not saying that we &apos;re not talking about our society .
Now you go to any of the _UNK_ of civilization
It may take a Ph.D. degree to think that it &apos;s wrong .
is the age and the body ? &quot;
We should have a lot of different peak points .
But the point is that it &apos;s going to be
There are many places in the world that are not peak .
And it &apos;s going to happen to me
Those who think ethics is right and wrong answers .
And of course , they would think that ethics had the right answer .
because they &apos;ve heard these answers in the mysterious _UNK_ .
not because they think and analyze these issues .
And religion became the focus of moral _UNK_ .
But these religions say the right thing to do .
When we talk about moral , we begin to respect different opinions .
But we don &apos;t do that in other ways .
For example , the Dalai Lama got up every morning
And he thought to help other people are
And on the other side we have a break break .
He was interested in _UNK_ and rape .
And obviously , we see that every person has taken the time
would say , &quot; Well , the Dalai Lama is not
It &apos;s all right , and it &apos;s absolutely right .
It &apos;s not a mistake for a break break .
whatever it is to say to them ,
And my experience is that half of it is _UNK_ .
And half will tell you , &quot; They don &apos;t like that . &quot;
Now , if I &apos;m in a physical conference ,
I don &apos;t feel it , it &apos;s not my choice .
what &apos;s going to happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ,
I don &apos;t want to join any of my communities
And that &apos;s why we have professional skills
That &apos;s why we should rely on knowledge
There is no moral experts in the moral world
And what the world needs now is that
and their beliefs and ideas are absolutely possible .
to admit that these facts will change the way we talk about moral
We live in a world with dangerous technology .
or the standard of building and aircraft safety .
to find the answer , and it might be possible .
to answer the most important questions in human life .
There are some people here , or now in the rest of the world ,
And there might be some people who heard this ,
I was living in _UNK_ , talking to many _UNK_ women
They may have a different idea . They &apos;re going to be _UNK_ .
It helps us this , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s ... &quot;
And of course , this is not a very reliable psychology .
not to talk about these problems with the Chinese imperialism .
Sam _UNK_ : Let me look at the second hand ,
If the _UNK_ had to bear some kind of consequences ,
a very ridiculous hat , or in a face ,
I think everyone should do what we want to do , in a _UNK_ situation ,
I think we should not be so fast
a lot of people want to believe
I want to know what you &apos;re talking about .
and you don &apos;t have to think about it .
And over 100 years , you want our world
We walked along the way to _UNK_ rational
to understand the way the brain works ,
we &apos;re going to be able to figure out
We &apos;re going to start to find out
We can &apos;t get the freedom of freedom .
is a completely different story of two things .
I think we don &apos;t need the National Science Foundation .
We can scan every human brain in the brain
I think that these problems are right answers .
_UNK_ : If the conclusion is that they are really happy
Are you ready to change your intuitive judgment now ?
and you can still be able to love
you would say , &quot; Because I love my son ,
I don &apos;t want him to hell because of his boyfriend .
So I chopped his head down , and that &apos;s my love for him .
is that you can still feel a love .
_UNK_ : I hope this talk will continue .
And although it &apos;s not , maybe in the future . Thank you for TED .
I took the optional course of the _UNK_ ,
And I thought , &quot; Well , how do I use it
And then I started exploring the direction of protecting plants
or the kind of benefit that we talked about ,
They &apos;ve been there for thousands of years in the world ,
how to develop and use them and use them ,
Just take a glass . What do you see here ?
You &apos;ll see a new world , just as long as you move leaves ,
The length of one inch , a half mm ,
You can tell the benefit and the insects .
We need to know how to find it .
What kind of damage would it be to the plant ?
Or are we going to talk about the benefit of the _UNK_ ?
This is an _UNK_ , which will destroy _UNK_ , a _UNK_ ,
because it &apos;s going to produce a lot of _UNK_ .
And there are two sides that are probably two daughters ,
And then you can see what &apos;s caused by it .
You can see the leaf of the _UNK_ on the right hand ,
The left is the leaves of the _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ -- and the spider _UNK_ ,
and one inch to two _UNK_ length ,
And you can see this woman on the left ,
and they suck it with the _UNK_ of it .
About five minutes later , you can see it ,
Right , for those of you who are ,
You can see those harmful _UNK_ that are everywhere in plants ,
Right , those are the _UNK_ , the only _UNK_ ,
the mother of the mother , and then she _UNK_ .
And here you can see a _UNK_ process ,
and the hand is just in front of the enemy ,
in the middle of the _UNK_ fluid .
This is the appearance of the death of _UNK_ .
A few minutes later you will see it running out .
You can see this in a complete film .
If this is a _UNK_ , it will immediately mate with _UNK_ ,
and then they will be left immediately because they live .
_UNK_ can only survive three to four days ,
And this is a little bit better than that .
And there &apos;s a lot of other predators ,
We &apos;re going to be the official language here ,
It &apos;s not a foreign species , it &apos;s not a _UNK_ ,
This is a _UNK_ that has never been able to eat ,
You can see the black _UNK_ and two _UNK_ .
If we spread this tiny _UNK_ , that kind of benefit ,
So this is a pretty positive situation .
There is no harm to the fruit of the growth , no harm to mature fruit .
You can see that this is a phenomenon of _UNK_ --
Right , there &apos;s a wonderful landscape there .
And there was a mountain range in Jordan ,
There is a _UNK_ in the upper left-hand corner .
We are in the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
And it &apos;s going to be done by this ,
that will come in the _UNK_ of the period ,
And by this watch , you can see exactly ,
But no matter what you ask a few people ,
So , for example , this is a place where
especially under the greenhouse conditions , in a transparent room --
If you drive to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
This is why we ask _UNK_ to use _UNK_ .
In the same way , this might soon happen .
And finally , I want to talk about my opinion ,
I think it will be about 100 times .
how we &apos;re going to fill it , or to make this gap .
First of all , we need more health ,
And the third thing is that the _UNK_
And what we &apos;re talking about is that we can do it ,
And I &apos;m going to show you the natural _UNK_
The mystery of social collapse , I believe that all of you have been interested in this ,
that had been there , but then the _UNK_ society ,
like _UNK_ civilization , the classical _UNK_ civilization , Easter Island ,
_UNK_ civilization , the moon civilization , _UNK_ civilization , the great _UNK_ civilization , etc .
And in the last 10 to 20 years ,
The _UNK_ showed us the _UNK_ of these social _UNK_
But there &apos;s a lot of places in the world ,
and there are thousands of years of history ,
like , Japan , Java , _UNK_ and _UNK_ . Obviously ,
In comparison with other societies , some societies are more vulnerable .
How are we going to understand this ?
because it &apos;s the same thing in the world .
There are some societies , such as _UNK_ ,
Rwanda and the _UNK_ . And in addition ,
There are some _UNK_ societies like Nepal , Indonesia , Indonesia , Columbia .
In history , there are so many social or decline , or falling ,
How should we avoid _UNK_ in the past ?
The answer to this question is obviously in many ways ,
If somebody told you , &quot; These _UNK_ are _UNK_ , only one reason . &quot;
It &apos;s a fool . After all , it &apos;s a very complicated problem .
So how do we get to a _UNK_ ?
&quot; _UNK_ architecture , &quot; This is a list , and I _UNK_ the mysteries of social collapse .
and think about every factor . I &apos;m going to analyze the death of the Greenland .
to _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
So we can fully understand the people and their motivation .
In AD , a group of pirate _UNK_ arrived and settled down .
to the _UNK_ , the whole social collapse ,
How do they all extinction ? Well , in my _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
The first point is that people affect the environment .
In this particular case , in this particular case ,
They need to make charcoal , and then use charcoal .
So although they were the European society in hardware , when they were _UNK_ ,
They can &apos;t _UNK_ the hardware . The second point on the list is :
_UNK_ : or _UNK_ , or _UNK_ , or _UNK_ , or _UNK_ .
In this case , in the _UNK_ century , especially in the 15 th century ,
The weather is _UNK_ . But the cold weather is not decisive ,
And the reason that _UNK_ lived on the island
It &apos;s a nice thing to face the _UNK_ climate .
So , why is the _UNK_ going to do that ?
And the third point on my list is :
With friendly relationships , these friendly _UNK_ can provide necessary aid .
And once this comes from a friendly aid , often _UNK_
This is a social collapse . In this case ,
They &apos;ve been in trade with _UNK_ , Norway , Norway ,
But on the one hand , the Norway is _UNK_ ,
On one hand , the water of the two _UNK_ is gradually frozen .
The fourth point on my list is : relationships with enemy territory .
In this case , their enemy was _UNK_ ,
and _UNK_ , they were the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
but they &apos;re not _UNK_ . And we know ,
They blocked the path of _UNK_ to _UNK_ ,
And every year the _UNK_ needs to be supported by this _UNK_ .
And finally , the fifth point in my list :
a political , economic , social and cultural factor ,
These factors can lead a social awareness and resolve the environment that it meets .
And in this case , in this case ,
The _UNK_ is the religion of religion ,
As a very popular society , they look down ,
So they rejected _UNK_ . This is the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
How to explain the _UNK_ of social collapse and the _UNK_ island of _UNK_ .
In the last five years , I visited the _UNK_ of my family ,
I was like a young man . I worked like a guy .
_UNK_ appear to be the most natural state in the United States .
But it &apos;s going to discover that it &apos;s a lot of serious problems .
Yes , this effect is very serious in the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ dollars . In addition , the _UNK_ area is still declining ,
and the forest fire problem . And then think about my second point :
The climate change : Yeah , the climate of _UNK_ becomes more _UNK_ ,
The main agriculture of _UNK_ is to rely on _UNK_ ,
Because the climate is getting _UNK_ , we can see
The glaciers in the National _UNK_ are going to disappear ,
More than half of the people &apos;s income today .
is not going to be born in _UNK_ ,
but it &apos;s _UNK_ , and it &apos;s mainly about :
This makes _UNK_ one of the most vulnerable states in America .
Number four : the relationship with enemy territory . This is the problem of _UNK_ .
Like other states , they &apos;re all threatened by _UNK_ ,
terrorist attacks , and eventually , the last thing I put on my list :
And the problem is that the _UNK_ is _UNK_
It seems to be _UNK_ to the problems they have .
&quot; The long - term values are dedicated to _UNK_ , mining and planting ,
and NGOs . And this values of values
In the past , the benefits of their economic development , but now it seems hard to succeed .
whether it &apos;s in the past or in the society ,
In some sense , as _UNK_ : unfortunate families have all the unfortunate _UNK_ .
In the same sense , every _UNK_ or _UNK_ society is different .
They have a lot of reasons . In spite of that ,
the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ society in history ,
to find an interesting point : the social development to its _UNK_ ,
and suddenly _UNK_ . In history , a lot of social developments
It &apos;s not a _UNK_ , but it &apos;s going to become powerful ,
and the power goes up , eventually , in a very short time ,
the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
In the early days of the 9 th century , the _UNK_ ,
In the same way , the _UNK_ of the Soviet Union
for decades before the Soviet collapse , it could be just 10 years ago ,
They are still in the _UNK_ of the past .
A phenomenon is similar to the number of bacteria in _UNK_ dishes .
or they don &apos;t get any money in the economy .
In the _UNK_ dishes , bacteria reproduce . Each generation , double ,
Just _UNK_ , to end . At first , the dish will have a blank space ,
And the next generation , the only _UNK_ space , the next generation ,
It &apos;s half . When the dish has a _UNK_ , it takes a generation ,
The dish was full of it . Because there was no more source of food , the bacteria _UNK_ .
A society is common to _UNK_ and falling down by _UNK_ .
And the phenomenon can understand that if you think about a society today ,
What you most care about is not the value of this math function ,
In particular , the GDP of a society ; what you should say ,
It should be the first order of this function and the second order .
more than one of the _UNK_ of social _UNK_ . And secondly ,
there &apos;s always a lot of subtle environmental factors
some of the other vulnerable and the environmental factors
Now we can &apos;t understand it . For example , why in the Pacific ,
In the hundreds of islands , only the eggs .
And it &apos;s about nine different environmental factors ,
Every _UNK_ , these factors bring their Easter Island
_UNK_ , these factors are involved in volcanic _UNK_ ,
is the dust from Asia on the island ,
And the dust , with a lot of nutrient ,
In the process of _UNK_ soil , all Pacific _UNK_ can be profitable from Asia &apos;s continent dust ,
But the eggs , for the distance , make the minimum profit .
This phenomenon , we went to 1999 until we realized it .
In the classroom , the most _UNK_ of my students
How did these societies find them in the _UNK_ ?
How do the Easter Island _UNK_ their own homes ?
What do they feel when they _UNK_ their last palm ?
Why don &apos;t they know what they &apos;re doing ?
How could the social world not notice their influence on the environment ?
And I think the answer should be that our civilization will continue ,
So maybe the next century , people would be curious ,
That &apos;s how people live in 2003 may not notice ( Note : 2003 )
How did they get lost when they were committed ?
and look at history , we find the _UNK_ . But in the later days ,
We don &apos;t seem to be _UNK_ . In this case ,
to explain why these societies can &apos;t deal with their problems .
Why don &apos;t they realize the existence of problems ? Or consciousness ,
but can &apos;t solve it ? Or , if they don &apos;t solve it , it might be the speaker said , &quot; Well , if the speaker &apos;s going to be able to deal with that , &quot;
Why don &apos;t they keep it in the process ?
The conflicts of short - term interest and long - term interest .
especially when the _UNK_ policy , the social benefits are damaged ,
A decision could eventually create a global tragedy , but the short term policy could profit from it ,
They are likely to be _UNK_ , to implement this very risk decision .
The lack of _UNK_ will _UNK_ the social _UNK_ .
It was a very popular society , the most _UNK_ society ,
is more _UNK_ , more _UNK_ and more resources ,
until these numbers are over the adjacent tribes . This is the _UNK_ ,
and they act on what they call &quot; _UNK_ , &quot;
But the _UNK_ of the whole social collapse .
The conflict between the two interests of the United States today
The policy of the United States today is usually
And they could _UNK_ their lives in the courtyard ,
_UNK_ , _UNK_ . In the last _UNK_ years ,
And the obvious truth is that those business world _UNK_ ,
But the _UNK_ gave the whole society a disaster .
for example , billions of dollars in Iran &apos;s problems ,
It was a great help for their short term interest ,
And the second thing I want to mention is ,
In a society , sometimes it &apos;s very _UNK_ , or _UNK_ .
Some reasonable decisions , especially when it comes to
when the values are values . Sometimes , the solid values are must ,
and a huge _UNK_ . But it &apos;s just because these two reasons :
that leads them to a very difficult way to change ,
and learn to _UNK_ . Another example : Australia .
that Australia is able to survive and develop ,
but it makes it difficult to adapt to them
in Asia . So this is a hard transition process :
to realize the things that are going to come to you ,
is the source of your power before .
Well , we all know today , dozens of _UNK_ in society
are walking in a _UNK_ . These are the _UNK_ bombs .
In recent decades , the most _UNK_ , would not be more than 50 years .
But every one of us can be _UNK_ . For example , water resources ,
There are _UNK_ problems , population problems , toxic matter , etc .
there are nearly 12 . These are the _UNK_ bombs .
almost 50 years ago , and most of them
is there in the last few decades . There are places
even more recent years . In the current trends ,
and they could run out of the forest ,
It takes five years to go to the _UNK_ Islands ,
And the wood is their main exports . It &apos;s certainly right .
The economy of the _UNK_ Islands is _UNK_ . People often ask me ,
In order to save the Earth , the _UNK_ of the ecological environment ,
My answer is that one of the things we should do
to give up the idea that we just need to do the best thing ,
After all , we face a problem , and every one is fatal .
We must solve all these problems , or even if we &apos;ve done 11 ,
And there are 12 , and we have the same example ,
If we solve _UNK_ problem , soil problems and population problems ,
But there is no poison problem , we must be in trouble .
In fact , we are at the _UNK_ stage ,
In _UNK_ , this state is not going to be a long time .
In the next decade , these problems are solved .
Now , the people who are watching my talk ,
the people under the age of _UNK_ will be lucky to see these _UNK_ ,
And those over 60 people , for example , I might have seen it ,
But our children , or the _UNK_ must have seen this moment .
And these problems are likely to have two kinds of solutions :
So , for example , we take some _UNK_ measures ,
Or , these conflicts are going to be done
not the way we &apos;re going to change , the war ,
or famine . It &apos;s going to be certain
This is not going to end in the next decade , by the way or so .
In other words , since the theme of this series
_UNK_ , we have to choose . The analysis is not _UNK_ .
All right , can we be _UNK_ ? I think it &apos;s just opposite .
Now the big problems in the world are not at all .
beyond our control . After all , the biggest threat that we face
The asteroids _UNK_ the earth , if it were , we would have to do it alone .
Instead , all of the big threats we face today ,
It &apos;s all done . Since we can make these problems ,
And we can actually solve these problems . _UNK_ ,
to deal with these problems in our power .
In particular , what can we do ?
for those who believe that we can change the future ,
There &apos;s a lot . There &apos;s a lot of things that we don &apos;t know now ,
But these things are important , we must figure out ; there are lots of things ,
although we &apos;ve figured out , but we haven &apos;t had time to do it ,
I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m going to come here .
I was born in Canada , a Scottish _UNK_ ,
in high school . I don &apos;t have a cell phone .
In addition , I did this on paper , and it didn &apos;t change the year .
But three years ago , I was in New York City .
So I think I &apos;m really the first person here -- I &apos;m the _UNK_ .
I call it a _UNK_ , because it &apos;s going to be serious ,
I use a _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ to describe it .
I was still at school , and I never quit it .
This is the only form I know . It &apos;s a very conservative _UNK_ .
And at the same time , you see , I use _UNK_ ,
This is a Scottish castle , and people play golf in it .
The rules are to play golf out of a medieval body .
This is a picture of my series of photos , and later _UNK_
This is called _UNK_ . This is a _UNK_ named Henry _UNK_ .
In the _UNK_ community -- I &apos;m interested in _UNK_
This is a museum I submitted in Los Angeles .
You can see , I and Frank _UNK_ are coming from a place .
So I had to invent a new word for it .
I made a lot of work , and I call &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
is to look at how yesterday was going to see tomorrow .
And the time for the _UNK_ is that
Any thing that can bring you from the future
This is the _UNK_ , a popular scientific magazine ,
I collected a lot of these _UNK_ magazine
And those poor people , like they called _UNK_ ,
to play ice hockey at 300 miles an hour .
it &apos;s going to be done , it &apos;s going to become _UNK_ .
because I had a car painter and a car ad manager .
So I was a little bit more _UNK_
Detroit has always had a foot in the future -- the foot in advertising --
This is a _UNK_ car : a lot new , they &apos;re going to look like yesterday .
This is a ticket to love the car in the mouth .
It was coming from a whole book , about 18 pages .
And I went back to my daily _UNK_
Technology -- _UNK_ meant to be _UNK_ , to find a miracle that never happened .
_UNK_ Berlin -- this is from a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is the biggest thing that humanity creates .
It can take 56 people , speed and a _UNK_ , flying height to hear you
And you want to fly it , it &apos;s more expensive than the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
So it &apos;s not , you know , it &apos;s inevitable and must happen .
This is the rotation of Mali in the competition .
This is not until the invention of the helicopter ,
But it should wait -- it &apos;s not a great success .
This is the only invention of Spain , _UNK_ , in the 20th century ,
_UNK_ never left the ground -- it was a dream of the World War .
My dad told me that we would have a _UNK_ future
Look at the future , every American family could have them .
I don &apos;t mean to be famous in the _UNK_ , but I &apos;m a lot of these works .
It was a love for the past hundred years .
One once said , _UNK_ is a very _UNK_ human emotion .
So I thought that the theme of this serious game
This is one of these _UNK_ -- this is called _UNK_ .
to think about French in the _UNK_ , the warm summer .
on the wing of the airplane . You can &apos;t see it .
But _UNK_ is reading his new novel ,
to _UNK_ and Ford until he was _UNK_
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And _UNK_ is one of the important parts of my serious _UNK_ .
those of you , like , are the four types of _UNK_
They can only walk five miles a hour , and there &apos;s a dark one in it .
And they have a little _UNK_ in this room .
to prevent the use of the German _UNK_ .
This is a Manhattan _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
You can drive the front door of your room .
In order to pure _UNK_ , I tried to get _UNK_ and a big boat
I like to cigar , and there &apos;s a cigar on the bottom ,
_UNK_ can also be used in many serious themes , for example , war .
This is the good days in the British _UNK_ .
When _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ into the House of England ,
_UNK_ , just to sit down under the bottom ,
The Big Mac is a way to express the absolute limit .
for it . This is my drawing , and it &apos;s a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , the largest thing in the world .
This is a version , you see , because it &apos;s going to be better .
The passengers in _UNK_ haven &apos;t reached their _UNK_ , the whole journey has been over .
but it &apos;s not about the minds of the _UNK_ .
And the poor thing is , I think , absolutely can you call
It doesn &apos;t mean anything , it &apos;s in the Mississippi .
I was the back of the crash , and I had only four hours to draw a book
And I did it for a _UNK_ in the country .
And I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry , but nobody wants to notice it . &quot;
The city &apos;s _UNK_ -- this is the New _UNK_ .
When I painted these cover , I tried to make New York look more _UNK_
I painted about 40 of them , about 30 of them
I drove seven _UNK_ in the middle of the night .
and saw a steam coming out of the ground , and I thought , &quot; What &apos;s going on after that ? &quot;
The temple in New York City -- it &apos;s a _UNK_ place .
I &apos;d like to make it _UNK_ , something interesting .
The cover is very _UNK_ , at least in New York City .
I was really unable to draw , and I received a _UNK_ from what environmental organization
&quot; This question is sacred , you should be ashamed of it .
I &apos;ve been doing this for a while -- but maybe maybe it &apos;s not .
This is the New York _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
If you live in New York , you know how these _UNK_ are going to jump .
except they would have a _UNK_ on the back -- they all do it .
A lot of the readers thought he was a terrorist .
is about to launch the rocket in the _UNK_ cycle ?
This is the only fashion cover that I did .
These _UNK_ live in the shoe , and come out of this kind of thing .
And the question is , &quot; Look at the community . &quot;
I don &apos;t know much about fashion , I don &apos;t know .
I was painted by a painting called Mary _UNK_ .
And then I was _UNK_ by the art and the chief _UNK_ ,
because it &apos;s going to stop the headlines , and it looks bad ,
But I ended up _UNK_ , to make sure that the shoes
This is a little joke -- &quot; _UNK_ , _UNK_ is a good idea .
people ask me where you find inspiration , how do you think about these ideas
_UNK_ , this is the day I drink the wine wine ,
In the middle of the night , the only thing I want to do is write it down .
_UNK_ , I don &apos;t want to think about it .
After the publication , a lovely woman named _UNK_ _UNK_
If you know who she is -- call me , she likes this particular painting , too _UNK_ .
She was called _UNK_ , the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , so ?
I was _UNK_ , and I didn &apos;t say , &quot; Let &apos;s take the picture . &quot;
Finally , this is the cover of three pages , and never did it .
And I &apos;m not going to have it again .
This is &quot; The Human _UNK_ _UNK_ , &quot; which is a automatically _UNK_ , three parts .
You can &apos;t wait a moment , but if you look at enough
you can see that it &apos;s actually going to move .
_UNK_ , there was nothing to end a joke . It was my art .
I &apos;d like to take a look at an ad
I &apos;m going to have a child &apos;s books this autumn , called &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
is a _UNK_ of all the serious game .
in the elegant , not a very elegant bookstore .
I want to know how many people in the audience eat insects .
because the people on the planet eat insects .
Why don &apos;t you eat insects ? First of all , what is insects ?
The animals that are walking with six legs are insects .
And on this planet , there are _UNK_ insects ,
In fact , if we think about all the individuals ,
The weight of an insect is 200 to 2,000 kg ,
to contribute , and it &apos;s not worth free .
And I looked at the same American economy
A third of the food that we eat .
to the _UNK_ of their _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
At the end of the food chain , we eat these animals .
It &apos;s a lot of people who eat insects .
in a small city in China , in the northwest --
If you go out and go out , like in _UNK_ ,
You can choose the same quality of fish ,
to choose the food you want to eat .
That &apos;s just the Chinese little town that we can &apos;t afford it .
But we &apos;ve seen a lot of people here
But I &apos;m going to tell you that we all eat insects ,
If they are good enough , they will be _UNK_ by the grocery store .
but it &apos;s also made up of tomato sauce .
There are all kinds of things in processing food ,
In fact , why do we put _UNK_ in the soup ?
&quot; Well , we just eat 500 _UNK_ insects . &quot;
in order to eat insects in order to eat them .
We &apos;ve made a lot of red in the food production .
is that the crab , or sold a crab ,
Now , the world is changing the world ,
For me , everyone on the planet is on you .
It means that we have more population to feed .
It &apos;s a problem that makes more and more people worried about .
and look at the data of the _UNK_ tissue ,
It says we have more than a third of the population now to feed ,
Once the wealthy people start to eat more food ,
We eat a lot of animals that make up ,
And of course , we &apos;re going to be able to
I know because I &apos;ve been a long time ago .
from any kind of food that can get protein .
And these problems are going to be more common .
The first question we &apos;re going to face is human health .
We can even transplant the pig &apos;s organs into the _UNK_ .
It indicates that pigs and humans have a lot of common diseases .
that the Dutch had happened in the last three years .
This new disease is going to be fatal .
People eat insects because insects and us are very different ,
but you can get nine kg of meat .
you get a _UNK_ or nine kg of _UNK_ .
One _UNK_ , or five kg of _UNK_ output .
That nine kg of output was brought in .
And the insect waste is not like a _UNK_ .
the proteins , the fat , and the vitamin D ,
with any _UNK_ we eat at the moment .
Even if you measure the heat , the insect is quite good .
a lot of the benefits of eating insects ,
I &apos;ve given you at least four reasons for eating insects .
_UNK_ are stored in production and transportation of the feed .
If you remember , we need to increase
On the left , you see the _UNK_ market
all kinds of insects , used to cook dinner .
very few people don &apos;t like to eat shrimp ,
In fact , _UNK_ is the _UNK_ on the land ,
The _UNK_ will make our diet become very rich .
We look at insects , these creatures are _UNK_ with us .
I and my colleagues , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , we can ,
If the human extinction , the insect will be happy to breeding .
So we have to adapt to the idea of eating insects .
Some people think that insect has not been _UNK_ to eat everyday .
In Holland , the Dutch _UNK_ make insects ,
And there &apos;s one of them in the audience ,
I expected to buy food at the end of this year ,
When you buy insects , you know that this is a _UNK_ insect .
and they will be the most delicious food .
There &apos;s a lot of design to make insects .
In Holland , we have a wealthy agricultural minister ,
when she invited all the European Minister recently
This is not my personal hobby . It &apos;s not .
A few years ago , we had _UNK_ people together ,
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a big news when we eat insects .
And I &apos;m going to try and figure out
_UNK_ _UNK_ : So let &apos;s see these delicious .
BG : They actually see the great insects in the video .
I &apos;m not going to start with three minutes ?
Chris Anderson : No , no . The _UNK_ started _UNK_ .
But I &apos;m not so nervous about five weeks ago .
five weeks ago I did all the hip replacement ,
unless you &apos;re a _UNK_ , because he thinks it &apos;s only perfect .
And of course , David , if you &apos;re not your hip , it &apos;s really wonderful .
In short , it gave me a great _UNK_ .
And Chris asked me to share with you
But first of all , I have two things to say
First , I am _UNK_ . Second , I am the youngest child in seven children .
In Canada , we have a very good health care system
That means that the hip is free ,
everything was the last turn to me .
My hip bones have been _UNK_ for years .
I finally went to the doctor and that was free .
She transferred me to the bone surgeon and it was free .
After ten months , I finally met him -- almost a year !
I met a surgeon who took me a few free X _UNK_ ,
I looked at these _UNK_ , and you know ,
So he said , &quot; _UNK_ , we have to arrange for your hand . &quot;
I &apos;m going to give you a hip -- maybe 18 months .
I &apos;ve been waiting for 10 months , and now I &apos;m going to wait for 18 months .
What you know is that the _UNK_ wait for me
and start using TED to calculate the time .
In this TED , I &apos;m not going to have a new _UNK_ .
I &apos;m not going to have a new _UNK_ in Africa .
At TED , I &apos;m not going to have a new _UNK_ .
My bad _UNK_ still accompany me . It was too disappointing .
So I left his office and I walked in hospital ,
The seven children had to figure out how to go ahead .
We &apos;re not going to talk about this -- _UNK_ -- it &apos;s not about it .
In fact , when we travel abroad , we are _UNK_ ourselves .
Hey , you &apos;re a _UNK_ ? &quot; I &apos;m a _UNK_ . &quot;
So , no , I don &apos;t mind the list behind the old man .
Now I was walking in the hospital , of course , my pain .
because my hip bones . I need a guidance .
The small _UNK_ in the hospital has a notice .
There is no general examination background , not to recommend people
because the average age of volunteers in the hospital is 75 years old .
So I soon dressed up a bright blue volunteer .
_UNK_ , the 89 - year - old wife , had a comprehensive training for me .
I work every Friday morning in the morning .
And I &apos;ll tell them , &quot; 18 months later I can accept hip replacement .
It &apos;s a great thing to do it again . &quot;
All the staff of the hospital knew the brave young volunteers
So , I took the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ to see the doctor
I took them to the back of the doctor &apos;s office .
After a few weeks , my surgery had been changed .
Now the rumor of the _UNK_ of the city
I can go ahead of schedule because I did volunteers
But you know , I &apos;m not so ashamed about it .
First of all , I &apos;m going to deal with my new hip bones .
In addition , I will continue to be a volunteer service
The big sign I &apos;m actually getting from here
They are also good for the society .
and the more connected to the world .
In order to prove my point , I &apos;m going to tell you
how science is going to solve the problem
a simple , _UNK_ problem of the mass .
If you _UNK_ your iPhone , it can tell you what time is .
But I want to ask you , if you don &apos;t have the iPhone ,
Or how are you going to know the time ?
There &apos;s a item that will help to get time information ,
In the current time , the existence of _UNK_ has been unknown .
_UNK_ is an astronomical instrument , which _UNK_ the star .
So , the _UNK_ of _UNK_ is the same thing
A part of the stars in the sky is _UNK_ .
The main part of the _UNK_ _UNK_ has some scale for use and _UNK_ other parts .
You should know how to use a _UNK_ ,
and also should know how to make _UNK_ .
because the first piece of writing about _UNK_ ,
In this book , _UNK_ could learn the main way to build _UNK_ .
to build the core of the _UNK_ technology
Imagine the Earth as the center of the universe ,
And the sky around the earth is _UNK_ to a sphere .
_UNK_ to a plane , and these data are recorded .
So the North Star is in the middle of _UNK_ .
And the _UNK_ will be _UNK_ to a circle from the center ,
And those bright stars will be _UNK_ with the _UNK_ ring .
The real attraction is not the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s going to have two different kinds of _UNK_ systems
This is the place of the sun , the moon and the planet on this network .
and they &apos;re in the middle of the sky
is by looking at the latitude of the plate .
Please wait for a moment to come back .
The Oxford University Museum of Science in Oxford
It was a _UNK_ to take this _UNK_ .
This is the main part of the _UNK_ , the back is the scale .
This is _UNK_ . Do you see it ?
And the spider pattern is _UNK_ with the local _UNK_ .
This is a _UNK_ . It &apos;s on the back of the dish .
and some scale , they can help to calculate .
My graduation work is a paper _UNK_ .
but it &apos;s even more expensive than my house ,
and I &apos;m going to add to my house next to me ,
and maybe add to a school , and some -- churches .
Let me show you how this _UNK_ is used .
The first thing is that you have to start with the night sky
To choose a star , of course , it &apos;s only when you use it at night .
tonight , you can clearly see the _UNK_ of the summer .
Where a very _UNK_ star , it &apos;s called _UNK_ . Let &apos;s choose _UNK_ .
It &apos;s about 26 . You can &apos;t see it .
The third step in the positive direction of the star .
It &apos;s nice to move the entire sky so that the stars are _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to put the model of the universe in my hands .
&quot; Is it a hard problem ? Are we going to have to do a lot of time ? &quot;
Compared with _UNK_ &apos;s iPod , the use of _UNK_ takes more time .
But those two are _UNK_ , when you use iPod or iPhone ,
And you can only learn about the time ,
And he will also know what the sky is .
And Lewis will not only know what time is ,
And he can also know where the day is ,
He will also know how to _UNK_ and sunset .
and eventually he will know all the things in the air
It will know the quality of the item .
And the _UNK_ would allow us to
to connect the night sky to the sky ,
It can make us look at the night sky ,
These _UNK_ learn from text , and the general use
You can start a survey . The ancient _UNK_ have done similar surveys .
_UNK_ can also be used to operate all kinds of mathematical equations .
The university is worthy of a course for _UNK_ research .
This is _UNK_ , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
I think the _UNK_ of the _UNK_
The earliest _UNK_ were very primitive and simple .
I think it &apos;s just _UNK_ , because it &apos;s _UNK_ shape .
But what it described is a _UNK_ sky .
He had a _UNK_ . He could have wood or paper .
_UNK_ . At the time , most of the people
They can usually be stored in your pocket .
Now , the technology is going to allow us to get
to understand the sky , understanding the sky between us .
I think _UNK_ is a remarkable device .
So what can we learn from this ?
The first one is to introduce the robot called _UNK_ .
You should know _UNK_ &apos;s novel &quot; World War , &quot; and it &apos;s adapted to the film .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a pop .
In the novel , the _UNK_ of the Earth
is described as a three foot foot robot .
But my robot , _UNK_ , is not that moving .
I &apos;m going to show you how robots move .
One leg , in the middle of the two legs .
This is the way he walks . But it &apos;s going to work .
is that humans are not using muscles ,
to take a leg out , like a robot . Right ?
We actually took a leg out , and we went down ,
_UNK_ , and then _UNK_ . _UNK_ down . _UNK_ .
using your body &apos;s internal power , the body &apos;s power .
We call the concept of a passive force movement .
So , although there are no three _UNK_ in nature ,
And so it &apos;s a robot that &apos;s _UNK_ .
What you see here is the target of our next step .
We &apos;re going to let the robot run the leg like spring , then launch it out and make a long distance .
and then _UNK_ legs , like the planet War .
The ground has three legs to absorb into the _UNK_ and start walking .
This is the yellow region , it &apos;s not _UNK_ .
And here &apos;s a camera that has a camera
because the robot is high , it &apos;s got _UNK_ meters high ,
It can be seen from the bush such as _UNK_ .
The first model , in the back , is _UNK_ .
The first one , a little bit , is a _UNK_ .
And the question that _UNK_ had come to
The robot is too heavy . We have so many motors ,
and things like that to adjust the joint type .
we can use a motor to replace all the motor ,
This is a mechanical solution , instead of mechanical integration .
So now the robot is _UNK_ above the body , can walk in the room .
It &apos;s not perfect . The robot fell down ,
So there &apos;s a lot of us behind the back .
The second _UNK_ of the robot is _UNK_ .
Each speaker can be able to _UNK_ the wheel .
is just using the touch sensors that are _UNK_ ,
The ground is soft and changing with its _UNK_ .
As a video display , one of the three _UNK_
and the _UNK_ system to figure out the size of obstacles and measurements ,
to make a _UNK_ , carefully planned movement ,
and _UNK_ all the different parts of it , and that shows
You may never have seen such robots as this .
to turn the wheel , and the way it works ,
which is the right round and the right direction .
For _UNK_ , we can use different ways to move .
As a video show , it &apos;s connected to a _UNK_ ,
to the same speed as the speed of speed .
The difference is that we rely on the length of _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
The change of the _UNK_ length changed the diameter of the speech round to achieve _UNK_ .
These are just some _UNK_ that can do
I was talking to a lot of scientists in NASA ,
In the _UNK_ laboratory , the most famous one is _UNK_ .
By this inspiration , we &apos;re going to build a
It has three legs . It may be hard to see ,
But it has a _UNK_ at the top , a cable .
It &apos;s going to work on the best _UNK_ .
and it takes a lot of force to do ,
and then use the _UNK_ to climb up a little bit .
five years ago , I was driving in NASA
They have six _UNK_ robots called the _UNK_ .
based on this robot , which is called _UNK_ .
We put a very interesting load on it .
And the students like interesting robots . You can see
depends on the content of water or the _UNK_ .
The robot &apos;s self - _UNK_ gait so that it can _UNK_ such terrain .
In addition , it can also make some funny things .
When visitors come , the _UNK_ robot will go close to computers ,
We don &apos;t have time to talk about the technical details ,
And this is some of the earlier _UNK_ .
The flexible skin is a potential to make it move .
and we use a rope that has a tension ,
This robot is the latest project . It &apos;s called _UNK_ .
There are a lot of good machines in the market .
but it &apos;s just going to be very expensive .
It &apos;s probably not true for the use of an arm ,
We thought of a very different way to solve this problem .
It &apos;s compatible . You can actually adjust the pressure
The strength of it can _UNK_ a blank _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ objects , such as _UNK_ eggs ,
The best thing is that this _UNK_ cost 200 dollars .
This robot is actually a series of _UNK_ robots ,
This student may be the first time to use it ,
For example , in Iraq , in the war zone ,
It takes a lot of time and time
to train control the operator of this complex vehicle .
This student may be the first time , to complete complex tasks ,
We &apos;ve got a _UNK_ that &apos;s interested in groups ,
We decided to build a little _UNK_ robot .
Is it possible ? What are we going to do ?
As you know , if you don &apos;t have a controller ,
There is a slight disturbance to the problem .
It &apos;s cable , and a cable cable . We still use external power ,
In 2006 , it was time to find fun .
give him intelligence . We give it the computational capability ,
_UNK_ four torque _UNK_ sensors , lithium battery .
There &apos;s no _UNK_ . It looks around , looking for the ball ,
and look around , looking for the ball , try to get _UNK_ ,
Look at it . This is our first test ,
There is a competition called the _UNK_ world .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re _UNK_ around the world .
The aim of the World Cup is that
We have the _UNK_ _UNK_ of the human size .
It &apos;s a real goal . It &apos;s a very ambitious goal ,
We think that we can do that .
We are the United States &apos;s _UNK_ game to win the game .
And the three things that are going to be
This is a picture of a beautiful thing .
We want to bring it back to America next year ,
In the holiday concert last year , it actually _UNK_
It &apos;s going to go away . This is the _UNK_ ,
You can see it in the lobby .
We believe that this will be the first running .
_UNK_ robots in the United States . So let &apos;s look at it .
Well , I &apos;m showing you some interesting robots that we &apos;re interested in .
can run through the city . We win _UNK_ million dollars .
We call the challenges of a blind driver ,
and there are lots of other robots that are going to happen .
These are the prize we won in 2007 ,
I was going to bed in the morning ,
I sat down , close my eyes , some _UNK_ ,
and put it together , they make some machines .
And there was a book in my _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ , with a special pen with a LED ,
because I don &apos;t want to wake up my wife .
I see these graphics , _UNK_ my thoughts on me ,
The first thing that you have before you drink your teeth ,
I &apos;m going to open my laptop . I &apos;m going to open it .
And sometimes , some of the _UNK_ are going to go up ,
And sometimes , I don &apos;t even know my writing .
what you say in the morning , where can you go ?
And sometimes I &apos;m going to see the ingenious ideas ,
I went directly to the study and sat next to the computer ,
and put my ideas , and what I did ,
If you match me , I write a research proposal ,
to do that , and that &apos;s how we start our research plans .
It &apos;s just a piece of inspiration and it &apos;s not enough .
in the robot and the mechanical Lab ,
Before discussing , we set up a set of rules .
And it &apos;s important , because a lot of times , the students
And they have the idea of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and it &apos;s full of creative energy in the room .
It &apos;s not enough for me to say a little more .
It &apos;s not enough to have ideas and _UNK_ .
I think he &apos;s a _UNK_ , right ?
In fact , this is a positive and negative .
that people can only do so much ,
is that beyond the _UNK_ of the robot
We need more stuff . These are all school teaching .
There was a famous _UNK_ belt , a _UNK_ ,
These tools are the course of the classroom .
The more we have to do is to solve problems .
You have to work hard to do it .
This is a photograph taken at three o &apos;clock in the morning .
If you &apos;re three or four to our lab in the morning ,
not what I ask , but they have interested in doing .
This is the secret of our success , and we work with pleasure .
I think there are so many _UNK_ that there are plenty of _UNK_ .
and how to improve these two stories .
This is North Carolina , if we zoom in ,
_UNK_ is in the east of the state ,
It &apos;s only _UNK_ people , and it &apos;s very _UNK_ .
All those who have received higher education and _UNK_ have left , and never returned .
Now , the whole American charity is only _UNK_ .
But the population in rural areas represents 20 percent of the population .
So _UNK_ isn &apos;t just rural , and it &apos;s very poor .
A third of the kids live in poverty ,
It was become a rural village in the countryside .
and the peanuts that we don &apos;t know about .
And the biggest employer is _UNK_ chicken .
What you see here is the _UNK_ Square in the Thames .
And here &apos;s an empty building or a broken building .
And the number of restaurants in the _UNK_
But there was no coffee shops in the town .
This is a recent picture of students in local newspapers .
You can see the difference between the two .
only eight percent of the people in the town
A third of the people who receive eight grade education
It sounds like I &apos;m describing a very dark picture about this region ,
is that this guy is going to be
He was first built in some of the early &apos; 80s
He &apos;s absolutely _UNK_ and is very _UNK_ .
He was also why I settled in _UNK_ and work .
a design company that I built in _UNK_
to go to _UNK_ and work with him .
to try and repair the school with a design perspective .
At first we were invited to the place
When I say , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m a _UNK_ .
But more exact , I mean , my partner , _UNK_ ,
a designer and a _UNK_ type of architect
_UNK_ to now , we are living in _UNK_
I had to cut off the head of the photograph
because if he knew I was using it , he killed me
This is our _UNK_ , and we live there .
through the _UNK_ of the year of _UNK_
We know that we are in love with this place .
We have fallen in love with the land and the people here
But it &apos;s there , except for our personal reason ,
The innovation of _UNK_ is basically empty .
There is no real license designer in the county .
_UNK_ design as a new tool to add to _UNK_ .
and the opportunity to do it is to
to design the public education system --
So the final goal is , yes , to design the education
and then figure out how to make education
In order to do this , we have three different ways
I have to say that these are three things that we &apos;ve done in _UNK_
I can now be very confident that we have the ability
The first way to design education is to design
This is a vehicle and a bad moving vehicle .
And we have a response to the poor material that we use in school .
In order to do this , we did a lot of different things .
First of all , a series of reform in the computer laboratory
These schools will have a _UNK_ of _UNK_
You go in and face this wall , finish the test , and you leave it .
We want to change the way the students contact technology
This is a lab that we have in high school
The president of the school likes the lab .
Every time he had visitors , the lab was his first trip to visit
And that means that some teachers can be able to
in playing games , running around and _UNK_ to the core curriculum
Now the kids are playing the game
In the &apos; _UNK_ , a class of children are divided into two teams .
The teacher would take a piece of chalk
and write a number of numbers on every tire .
And then she would have a mathematical problem
And every team has to figure out how to do
and four to four times the same size
and then found that the 16 _UNK_ sat down
The final goal is to let all your team sit down on the tires .
There &apos;s a lot of tests in many classes .
So I think the most important thing in education
is to share with all of the teachers .
And so they have the power and the wish
This is Mr. _UNK_ , who is the director .
He took part in one of our teachers
He was very proud to win five _UNK_ .
In many cases , we don &apos;t change what &apos;s going on directly .
In rural areas , in closed rural education systems
So , for us , this is what &apos;s called
There are thousands of these green dot in the county .
And this is the _UNK_ of the funds
And the goal is to _UNK_ the _UNK_
is the school building , or the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
I used to go there and go there
or don &apos;t know what these green dots are doing .
It allows education to come out of campus
to think about education in the world .
the way the Internet is going to be
The third thing that I &apos;m most excited about
we can actually teach in the public schools
not by _UNK_ them to study physical courses
And that means that designers are no longer _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , the oral professor of the _UNK_ ,
It allows the kids to really be true .
and the process , especially the wood technology and _UNK_ ,
and the kids in the university are open
Let &apos;s make a _UNK_ to your mom for Christmas presents .
In _UNK_ years , a lot of the funding fund
So we thought , if we _UNK_ the process course back ,
by working with Dr. _UNK_ for the last year ,
a year of course , a year of course ,
to get a high school teacher license to teach this lesson .
It &apos;s just been a hard and complex process
The students are going to be in a day
from going out and doing some of the necessary studies
and you get the processing room to test them .
and see if they can be able to improve them .
In the summer , they will get a summer festival
The first project will start building next summer
And then the next year of the bus system
And then the third year is to improve the lives of old people .
We want students to point to them and say ,
I want you to see a three of our classmates
She loves agriculture , hoping to be a high school teacher .
She went to college , but she wanted to go back to _UNK_
because there was her family , where she became a place
to give her a fortune to do something .
so she could _UNK_ her hometown in the most meaningful way .
Eric , who was in a football team ,
a place to be a designer &apos;s _UNK_ technology ,
He was 16 years old , like hunting , fishing and fishing
So if he finally couldn &apos;t go to college ,
and the design of the public education , really ,
is likely to be the place of our future market .
to get students to the community to interview your neighbors .
And the opening of the _UNK_ this summer
And then they &apos;ve built the market , and they &apos;ve been open
For community , design and construction of the community
We realized that H studio , especially in its _UNK_ ,
But we think that this is the other place .
And my deep belief in the power of this little story
you lose the ability to think of people as individuals
and what we call the designers &apos; _UNK_
Let &apos;s face it , _UNK_ , we need to _UNK_ ourselves .
We need to _UNK_ ourselves in the world .
We need more work outside our comfort studio .
We need to do a better citizen .
We still want it to be the right direction .
And if you &apos;re more than _UNK_ years old ,
The brain learns to look at the opportunity
Let &apos;s start with a personal story about it .
So , I think I need to do two things
and they &apos;re linked to each other , and they &apos;re _UNK_ .
It &apos;s the icon , although it looks particularly like the Irish script .
Now I &apos;m going to play a video clip
to show you a couple of different ways
PH : Because this is the _UNK_ school
We took the same child to look at the hospital ,
to help us find kids who can participate in _UNK_ ,
and look at the eyes of this child
You see this piece of rock in the middle of the _UNK_ .
But the child , his _UNK_ became _UNK_ .
So the child accepted the treatment and looked at his photographs
In this little movie , you &apos;ve already known about
that happened to be blind for years .
is the story of the woman on the right .
I had to add a tragedy to this .
She &apos;s a real and exciting form of _UNK_ .
to imagine that in science and popular publishing industry
And we &apos;re very convinced that we &apos;re going to have
to find a child that &apos;s sensitive to light
We treated a lot of children , through their work ,
The more we tried to do it , the better we could
Look , now you see a image on the left ,
whether it &apos;s true or artificial or artificial ,
This is the challenge that we have on the _UNK_ subject .
And this guy was just a few weeks ago ,
This is _UNK_ , and the students at MIT
He was busy looking for some of the places
or look at this image in the early &apos; 80s .
They can &apos;t identify most of the objects
You don &apos;t need to name , just point to things ,
That &apos;s the next video I want to show you .
And this is going to happen over and over again .
_UNK_ is so important for human vision .
to make it work , it doesn &apos;t have a program to operate .
And MIT is studying the subject of research ,
the same information as a child can accept .
The way to test the _UNK_ is through
It &apos;s like a baby to see or other kids on the subject ,
but we couldn &apos;t find it in a long time .
to try to get this video input ,
So this is the _UNK_ input video .
For this , I have to talk to my wife
What is this ? We want to do that .
to the _UNK_ of the video for a minute .
In clinical terms , it &apos;s applied to _UNK_ research .
So , when children are playing , we track their _UNK_ direction .
This is a normal kid , and you see
And the child is going to be able to
and then predict where the _UNK_ is going to go .
He could only play the ball in a _UNK_ .
And the red dots are the kids we &apos;ve treated
So , there &apos;s a lot of kids that need to be treated
to expand the scope of the subject ,
and it &apos;s a great force for the _UNK_ .
All in all , in the middle of the decade ,
to help the children who work with us .
_UNK_ : Amy and I just talked to me for a while ,
I want her to tell all the people what she made her a different player .
Amy : Well , if you &apos;ve seen a picture of my resume ?
I have legs legs , because I &apos;m born with two legs ,
Since then I &apos;ve been running all the time , I &apos;ve been running around .
_UNK_ : So you can tell you , for example , how do you go to _UNK_ ?
Amy : I &apos;m a _UNK_ student at _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
At high school , the success of a full scholarship .
They choose three students every year in the country ,
I won the opportunity to go to the _UNK_ .
I was there for four years , and I loved it .
She felt that she was kind of curious about the field ,
And so she decided to call the phone _UNK_ .
Amy : Okay . I guess I &apos;ve always been interested in sports ?
because I had a couple of years of movement .
And I never went to the _UNK_ of the disabled .
In fact , I &apos;ve been 17 years old to see the rest of the _UNK_ .
And I heard , you know , there &apos;s a special track for disabled people .
And I thought , oh , I don &apos;t know this game ,
But before I judge it , let me see how it works .
So , I ordered myself a flight called Boston . I was 19 years old ,
and became the absolute dark horse . I never had that before .
A few weeks before the game I found a _UNK_ .
50 meters are enough for me to be _UNK_ .
And then my leg was a kind of _UNK_
and wood and plastic cocktail , with nylon _UNK_ --
You know , that &apos;s not too comfortable , but I only had these .
with all kinds of _UNK_ that have been made .
You know , there are all kinds of things that are _UNK_ ,
Well , we know who &apos;s not going to win the game .
I mean , I went there and looked forward --
But you know , when I see a man who lost a leg ,
in the high jump , with a leg jump ,
And it took six feet to two inches --
I mean , this can give you a comparison -- _UNK_ .
So I decided to go to _UNK_ , you know , my heart was _UNK_ .
The first race in my life beat the national record ,
Let me try to _UNK_ as a new national record record .
&quot; Amy , you know , you know , you &apos;re fast -- you &apos;ve got a _UNK_ speed --
But you don &apos;t know how to run a running skill and strategy .
So I decided to call the _UNK_ and field coach .
Thank God that I didn &apos;t know that he was in this field .
The office of this man went from the floor
I called him , &quot; Listen , I went to a running game and I won --
I want to see if you can &apos;t , you know --
I want to see if I can &apos;t go to your training ,
Can I see what you &apos;re going to do here ?
And he said , &quot; Well , before making any decision , we still have a _UNK_ . &quot;
He was sure , &quot; What &apos;s wrong to give me ? &quot;
So , I went to meet the coach and walked into his office ,
and saw the _UNK_ who had trained _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
And we &apos;ve reached a great cooperative plan ,
So it &apos;s like , OK , we &apos;re going to go on a new journey .
And every Thursday , he gave me a rest of lunch ,
It was entirely in his spare time , I went to the _UNK_ and his training ,
But in the autumn , when the winter _UNK_ ,
You can join the women in our room . &quot;
And so in 1996 , I set up my plans to join the _UNK_ .
I joined the women in the top five months ?
Never did such a disabled man - to attend the university level .
So , this is all starting to become a wonderful combination .
Amy : Oh , yes , you know , all the awards I &apos;ve got before are disabled ,
But in the training of the _UNK_ ,
When I knew that I had to adapt
when you run around the back of people --
You know , I was running next to _UNK_ --
where they were with them , and they thought ,
must be _UNK_ -- and I &apos;m the best player in the country --
But you know , you must be trained with those who are superior to you .
And I went all the way into the Eastern _UNK_ ,
is that it &apos;s kind of like a _UNK_ .
From that _UNK_ I saw that I had just installed this special _UNK_ leg --
And the sweat of the socks of the _UNK_
I was like I did my _UNK_ in the _UNK_ ,
100 meters , when I was 85 meters , my God ,
It _UNK_ down , and in front of it , about 5,000 people .
And I &apos;ve got 200 meters of game , and it &apos;s going to start !
I came to the coach . I said , &quot; Please , let me run again . &quot;
I can &apos;t be _UNK_ in front of all audience . My legs will fall off .
If it fell at 85 meters , I could not finish 200 meters .
He &apos;s a heavy man -- he said , &quot; Amy , even if your legs fall down ?
You pick the guy up and you go back ,
I did what I did . So he was like , he left me ,
_UNK_ : So , Amy entered the _UNK_ Olympic Games in 1996 ?
She was very excited . She went to home -- but that was a big event .
_UNK_ : One year . You &apos;re going to tell you
And the _UNK_ Games , and the _UNK_ ,
And that was the Olympic Games in _UNK_ --
A person suffering from brain paralysis , and a _UNK_ player --
So , after a week of the Olympic Games , we arrived in Atlanta ,
I was shocked by myself , you know ,
I ran 50 meters on the sand track a year ago ,
I _UNK_ the American record -- on the Olympics -- that May ,
And you know , I &apos;m going to take the gold medal home ,
And I was also a _UNK_ , called the legs of the legs .
I was the only _UNK_ in the long jump project .
And a guy who hadn &apos;t had two legs came to me and said ,
&quot; How do you do that ? We should all be flat ,
I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to jump out . No one said . &quot;
It &apos;s funny -- I &apos;m about three inches from the world --
I &apos;ve been _UNK_ for a long jump -- _UNK_ --
No , I &apos;ve jumped long and 100 meters ,
I was on the front page of the newspaper in my hometown ,
It was like , at last I had to wait for the moment .
It &apos;s about a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium .
I was wearing this leg -- I could take them out .
I was the first person in the world --
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s kind of like trying to do the spot .
All the cameras look at me , &quot; What is the girl running ? &quot;
I had to look forward and think of where my opponents are ?
I want to do what I can do ,
&quot; Oh , Amy , we &apos;ll tell you later . &quot;
Now I began 20 minutes ago in the Olympic stadium .
They came to the final exhibition . I went to see ,
My best grades , and the world record is _UNK_ seconds .
I looked at the next line , and the next line was _UNK_ seconds .
And the third line is _UNK_ . I said , &quot; How is that ? &quot;
Then they pushed us all up to the bus .
All the _UNK_ on the top had a hand .
They all looked at me , like looking at _UNK_ , you know ?
I sat there and thought , &quot; Oh my God , my God . &quot;
whether it &apos;s a scholarship or you know ,
_UNK_ , I took five years of gold , and I was always the first .
Though I was never the first , the best training was the Olympic level training .
Now there is no _UNK_ , I &apos;ll lose , and I &apos;ll lose a terrible loss .
&quot; Oh , my God , my family is going to be a _UNK_ .
And I was the only _UNK_ _UNK_ in this game .
So , they _UNK_ my name with them .
When I took my leg to the end , I felt awful ,
because I heard people talking about it .
It &apos;s like they &apos;ve been watching me on the line .
I feel like , &quot; I know ! _UNK_ ! I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I knew I had only one last card , that was ,
At least I had to make them headache , do you know ?
I mean , that &apos;s all four _UNK_ of Germany .
All other athletes -- _UNK_ , _UNK_ -- are all _UNK_ .
And the only thing that I could remember when I started ,
trying to _UNK_ the tears in the stomach , and it &apos;s incredible ,
I have to figure out why you do that , you know ,
What is the first thing that I &apos;m going to do ?
All of these training have changed my life .
I became a college player and then the Olympic athletes .
And the truth was that I had just _UNK_ a month ago
I want to feel a lot about this orbit ,
and see where the limits are in place .
I did help -- how many people could use a long jump ?
how many people have paid their time , _UNK_ ,
In the back of me , there are 50 individuals
was involved in this incredible journey of Atlanta .
How long you go to this goal today .
And the goal , I think , is really important ,
It &apos;s also a success , which is really successful .
_UNK_ : Give us a look at not only those _UNK_ .
It &apos;s even _UNK_ , and I can add my nails to it .
At last you can go into the shoe of any shoe they like .
In _UNK_ , the athletes in the &apos; 80s
And I was _UNK_ in the training room ,
And I said , &quot; Put it up , don &apos;t worry about it ,
You have eight feet high , and you take them ! &quot;
Unfortunately , he wasn &apos;t like me , and he didn &apos;t think it was funny .
Well , here &apos;s my _UNK_ legs , carbon nanotubes .
I said , every time I &apos;m going to make sure they &apos;re right .
And these are -- can you take a hand ?
This pair , I used to play tennis and play _UNK_ .
It &apos;s got a _UNK_ , and when you wear it ,
I just _UNK_ this little little little _UNK_ ,
Maybe it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ ? I can take these two _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : She can &apos;t stand on either legs , she must walk , so --
And they kept a little bit of a art .
If there &apos;s no _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to try to put my legs into them ,
So , I was wearing them running , and they _UNK_ half the world .
These are the actual state of running when _UNK_ are used .
the only place they found in the _UNK_ is the spherical part of the _UNK_ toes ,
as if I stand on the part of my own _UNK_ .
Amy : Is a company called _UNK_ in San Francisco ?
I &apos;m a little _UNK_ , and I want to continue
and every little _UNK_ of the limbs ,
All of these , I said , well , are all _UNK_ .
I need a new product because you &apos;ve got a meeting , you know ,
It was a real -- it went back to the beginning .
CA : Amy and their designer are going to be two at TED .
Amy : So , these are _UNK_ legs , and I can put my other _UNK_ .
_UNK_ : Can you talk about who designed other legs ?
Amy : Of course . These are my English _UNK_ .
I am the only person in the United States .
It was a crime that they were really _UNK_ .
I can &apos;t _UNK_ , because of these toes , all the details --
For me , I was a serious player on the sports field ,
But I also want myself to _UNK_ , I think that &apos;s important ?
whether it &apos;s your _UNK_ , or even a fashion .
I mean , I &apos;m very happy to act free ,
to choose the shoe , the _UNK_ , the _UNK_ ,
I really want them to be in the future .
and the service is going to be more people .
Here is a very base , the original arm ,
I really think -- I &apos;ll let you look at it .
I don &apos;t know what you think about it , but they &apos;re really good .
and even a vein , and my heels are pink , like you see ,
And my _UNK_ -- it &apos;s also a _UNK_ .
It was amazing . I got them two weeks ago .
They &apos;re like having a skin of silica ,
If I was a little bit of a _UNK_ ,
to look at the foot and even the eyes are identical ,
is exactly the same leg , or the arm or the hand ?
_UNK_ : Two weeks ago , Amy went to accept _UNK_ , _UNK_ ,
She went to the city and _UNK_ around ,
And I said , &quot; I have to do that ! &quot;
because that means I walk all the night .
_UNK_ : We &apos;re going to get a _UNK_ minute , the _UNK_ Hotel is wonderful ,
They sent the shoes to come up .
Amy : I said , I was so _UNK_ , then _UNK_ was next to me ?
I said , &quot; Listen , are you going to help me ?
At first , they don &apos;t care , and that feeling is ,
If you don &apos;t like your shoe , I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s too late now .
&quot; No , no , no , no , no , no . I &apos;m a little bit special , I know ,
I need a double - inch shoe , I have only three inches .
They didn &apos;t want to touch that shoe , they &apos;d done it .
I &apos;m going to go back for a few weeks .
I &apos;d like to have a flat leg ,
so I can wear sports shoes , and now they &apos;re not .
it &apos;s going to be helpful to the _UNK_ debate .
the _UNK_ of our economy for a year .
And since _UNK_ came up with Napster ,
So this piece is what we &apos;re going to do .
and television , satellite television and cable television revenues rise a lot .
there &apos;s an expectation that there &apos;s an expectation
If you put this data in 1998 , it &apos;s not enough .
Other data shows that music industry is about four , 5,000 people
And as a result of the unemployment of the network ,
to give us a negative job market for our content .
And this is one of the _UNK_ numbers
And the copyright mathematician is going to deal with these data every day .
And some people think that the _UNK_ theory
This is a key number of _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
and the time it &apos;s going to be built ,
Some people think that this is too big .
Why does this figure not increase with inflation ,
The _UNK_ MP3 player in the world can save 10 songs .
a _UNK_ value of something that is worth _UNK_ .
Now a iPod _UNK_ can save four , _UNK_ songs .
When I made a mistake to the American economy again ,
compared with science , and in fact , you &apos;re going to come to _UNK_
Now our math education is faced with actual problems .
The government realized that this was a big issue of our economy ,
On the other hand , our world is more than before .
is more _UNK_ and _UNK_ in the world .
Now , where is the problem , why is it that ?
Let me briefly compare the math of our real world .
you get a _UNK_ answer in the real world .
A few years ago , you can &apos;t expect that you will get such answers .
But now you can understand that . You can see it .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m actually more weight than this , but --
Especially , why are we going to math as an intellectual education ?
Why is math an important part of education ?
There is no doubt about the numbers such as government data .
are getting into logic and part of the human society .
And when we say we &apos;re going to do math ,
In general , I think there are four steps ,
What is the problem of our _UNK_ ? What do we want to know ?
And this is any other steps in the outside world
And then we went into the third steps of the operation .
And of course , math is very useful in this aspect .
Finally , the solution to the real world &apos;s problems .
We might have spent most of the time
And it makes the students more energy
to follow the steps , one , two and four ,
Let the teacher show how to do it .
Now we don &apos;t understand why this is going to work together .
The only way we did the calculation is to _UNK_ it .
the use of the computer to allow any ancient disciplines
So , I think , despite the fact that mathematics
But the liberation of math is still not introduced to teaching .
It &apos;s the kind of thing you want to avoid , you can get the machine done .
It is not only the purpose of _UNK_ itself .
And this is not a small issue from any angle .
By the way , most people have no pleasure in making artificial operation .
just to teach people how to do it .
I still use the arithmetic , usually to estimate the prediction .
I &apos;ll say , well , uncertainty . I think the answer is like this .
The head is still more fast and useful in this aspect .
Notice , I never _UNK_ that if somebody &apos;s interested in artificial computing
But I don &apos;t think we should force the people
So I know that we should tell people
with people who are consciously learning in a certain way .
And why did people ask this question ?
And one of them would say , you have to start _UNK_ .
And the question is , what do you mean ?
How do you build a car or design a girl ?
and whether it &apos;s going to work on the geese ?
I think you need to do what you want .
_UNK_ years ago , if you want to be sure
to know that some of the cars are mechanical .
and the work principle of _UNK_ _UNK_ , etc .
That means that the car is now working with automobile
not only in the example of this kind of automation ,
because I believe that automatically _UNK_ will be the same thing in the future ,
The math can be used to more practical people
There is another view of the basic skills .
and should be used in the teaching of these tools .
It doesn &apos;t mean to teach the math in a paper .
And one of my daughters was _UNK_ to this point .
And one day , I asked her , &quot; I was in your age ,
You learn how to use paper or first use computer learning ,
And the other idea is , &quot; Computer _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
I &apos;m going to say that this is really _UNK_ me .
Now , people are often in the school
Most of them are still trying to answer their problems .
More serious , they have no practical _UNK_ in the school .
Maybe 50 years ago , but now it &apos;s no longer available .
In addition to education , they all use computers to do it .
To be sober , the computer has solved this problem ,
And as an example of the equation ,
It shows the students how to use _UNK_ and _UNK_ now .
Why are we going to show you how to use the computer ?
How the computer works a more complex topic .
you can turn it into four equation , and it &apos;s more complicated .
They &apos;re not all the simple things we have in our school math .
What we really do in the math education
You can also understand the foundation of math systems .
And I think there &apos;s a point in this idea that I really agree ,
That &apos;s what I think steps and operation are important .
But in modern society we have a good way to do that ,
If you really want to check if you understand math ,
So I think programming is the direction we should do .
Well , what I &apos;d like to say is that
I think this new situation in mathematics has not seen in any other disciplines .
But I &apos;d like to use computers to work at the same time .
The greater _UNK_ of understanding and experience than before .
in the _UNK_ World of _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
We hope that students can feel math in instinct .
Another point is that the computer enables us to _UNK_ the teaching course .
is the sequence of the difficult course of programming ,
And the difficulty of the idea is that
The problem is that the computing of _UNK_ is very difficult .
This is a model that I built for my daughter .
When the _UNK_ increase , the graphics changes are changed .
By the way , she can transform the color .
And you can see that this is a
and you can see the changes that are going to happen ,
The situation and the number of _UNK_ _UNK_ are _UNK_ .
We usually teach the students after a long time .
but it &apos;s a very important and practical observation of the world .
And finally , if the way we test is artificial _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s hard to design the current course
And since the reason that as an important reason
It &apos;s also important to use computers in the examination .
For example , &quot; Which kind of insurance insurance insurance is better suited to us ? &quot;
People have a problem like this in real life .
You can see that this is not the stupid problem .
This is a practical model that we can use when we choose .
And here I don &apos;t want to be aware of
the social progress that we have in the world .
from the era of what we call the _UNK_ economy .
It may be called the Age of Computer Knowledge ,
the math of the _UNK_ is about everyone .
We can get more students into this reform ,
to give them the best time to get this education .
You can see if we were walking through this gap ,
We must fall down and down the bones ,
We should jump from one of the _UNK_ ,
And of course , the _UNK_ equation is accurate .
believe it will cover every place in the near future .
Now I &apos;m not sure whether we should use math as a name of this subject ,
All people , the vast number of students and TED people enjoy some fun !
to make more people work with computers .
to write a whole new operating system from zero .
Or this is after the advent of apples
The operating system is the interface itself ,
It &apos;s like the land and the king in _UNK_ , the two _UNK_ are not divided .
It wasn &apos;t a hard thing to write a new operating system at the time ,
It &apos;s not just _UNK_ and _UNK_ some shapes and patterns .
There was no graphics display process , no mouse drive program .
has been roughly 10,000 times the size of _UNK_ .
Now it has become the _UNK_ of our lives
To deal with the _UNK_ _UNK_ server for more than _UNK_ dollars .
But those things are fundamental in the human interface ,
And of course , we &apos;ve seen a lot of changes in the last few years ,
that people have already started to wake up .
So what &apos;s going to happen ? How is the direction of interface and vision ?
you can use a simple word to say , &quot; space , &quot;
and the programming language , and the language ,
The space is an interesting thing because all of us are often _UNK_ and for granted .
They don &apos;t understand time , but that &apos;s another subject that needs to be alone .
You might have _UNK_ a thing like a light bowl .
You see , when you use a mouse , your hand has a mouse ,
And here &apos;s not even the same plane you &apos;re talking about ,
So this room , all the walls , the floor , the ceiling ,
is not only available , but it can be _UNK_ .
It means that input and output are all in the same space ,
There is the same response to the same .
No matter what you put in it , you always get out of it .
and you can do something else that &apos;s interesting .
It will try to figure out what you might want to do .
If you remove the _UNK_ from the _UNK_ ,
to put the _UNK_ in the cartons ,
with the actual object to make a beam of light and lens ,
The system is _UNK_ along the direction of the laser .
So this interface can actually say that there &apos;s no interface ,
And you &apos;re doing this with what you &apos;re doing in the real world ,
In a way , this is not cattle , because we don &apos;t invent the mathematical method .
But if you show it on a flat panel ,
and just give a thing , an object in the real world ,
and it &apos;s made up of this _UNK_ system ,
This system provides architects and cities of the city
to make them work with a more friendly interface .
It &apos;s going to _UNK_ digital shadow , like this .
If you take some tools like this clock model ,
then you can simulate the direction of the Sun .
We also did a series of tools like this ,
Even if they don &apos;t know about the urban planning .
To move a building as long as you can move your hand .
like _UNK_ _UNK_ , who is a style of architecture .
It will not be _UNK_ by the driver on the highway ?
_UNK_ tools can be connected to the distance , buildings and roads ,
Look , there &apos;s no risk for _UNK_ committee _UNK_ , etc .
is that in the lab at MIT ,
But _UNK_ was ready to make a little _UNK_ film ,
is that _UNK_ is so absorbed in the pursuit of _UNK_ ,
is that it &apos;s got to be _UNK_ ,
And he asked us to take his design up ,
This is something that makes us a unique way
Here we have a bunch of things , some images .
Now the eyes of Mr. _UNK_ , there &apos;s a point of meaning .
And here we have a lot of _UNK_ images ,
You must be able to navigation in three - dimensional space .
Most of the things we need to do
And those are not the ones that make it _UNK_ ,
to make our head easier to understand them .
Look , we can use these things in many different ways ,
It &apos;s like this . It &apos;s going to be _UNK_ ,
And if you need to analyze it , we can _UNK_ them back a little bit ,
This is another way of looking at things .
So , in fact , you might think about it .
-- in real space , the movement of the hand ,
in the real three-dimensional space , not in _UNK_ or _UNK_ space --
can _UNK_ the yellow and the green grass that we like .
Now , we &apos;re going to show some useful systems .
is a small block that we &apos;re doing right now .
One of the most important factors is to _UNK_ traditional _UNK_ data .
We &apos;ll pull it back and look at it .
because in the real world , we work together ,
Now we &apos;re going to look at these different images ,
So I took this thing from here to here .
So , the calculation here is _UNK_ with space and network .
Paul is a _UNK_ designer , so maybe he &apos;s here .
It is the simplest way to tell me that I am .
So I &apos;m going to move these things away now .
Let me see if I can help to find circuit boards .
You know , this looks like a _UNK_ scene ,
that we often do in the lab .
is that we need to work in space .
And finally , I want to be with you
and then go back to the world .
and you put it on the table ,
The French character left , and the system knew they were _UNK_ together .
He was not talking about the price of a novel ,
The famous painting of the _UNK_ of _UNK_
but it &apos;s the process of creating them .
And I think that this is the place
that the machine can help us in this respect ,
So I &apos;m going to talk about this today . Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m going to ask you a _UNK_ question .
Chris Anderson : When are we going to use it ? Not just in the lab or on this stage ?
Is this interface that every person can use to a business and film company ?
John _UNK_ : Of course , everybody can use it .
Is it really a user interface ? Of course it &apos;s not .
Chris Anderson : But that means that in _UNK_ or home ,
John _UNK_ : No , this interface will _UNK_ every display ,
They don &apos;t have a gloves for a few months or a few years .
John _UNK_ : I think you buy computer five years later .
This world will often create some of the amazing ways we can use it .
You think , in your head , what &apos;s the first application of this interface ?
John _UNK_ : This is a good question , and we ask ourselves every day .
They use this system in the real world ,
and it does all kinds of data processing problems ,
These are all the current application , but not _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about what I want to write .
I like to be fully involved in my research topic .
I cut directly into the subject to myself white mice .
My life is like a series of experiments .
I worked for the magazine a few years ago .
I hired a team in India in _UNK_ ,
They _UNK_ with my wife and asked my son to read the bed story .
because I just put it easy to read or read the film .
and I wrote a article about the magazine recently --
unless you &apos;re playing cards or golf exceptions .
And even when anything happens in your brain ,
I decided to try to see this way to live a month .
My latest book -- I &apos;m going to call &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
It &apos;s about the year that I spent my time reading the Big _UNK_ .
from the _UNK_ that I &apos;ve been studying the world .
or more accurately speaking from the East Asia ,
to the final &quot; _UNK_ &quot; -- I don &apos;t want to finish the speech .
It &apos;s exciting to end up with a _UNK_ novel , so I don &apos;t want to _UNK_ it .
because it &apos;s a message about how many human beings can absorb
And although Kevin _UNK_ says , you can only use Google
I &apos;ve done it recently , and I spent a year
and try to _UNK_ the principles of life on the Bible --
I first grew up in a completely _UNK_ environment .
And as I said , I was a Jewish man .
I think it &apos;s a clear issue in our lives ,
And my son . I want to know what to do .
So I decided to go into it and try to live in the Bible .
They are completely _UNK_ by the Bible .
_UNK_ or 50 Americans , _UNK_ &apos;s Bible teaching life .
So I decided to look at what the Bible does ?
I decided to accept it and its logic ,
First of all , I found a bunch of Bible _UNK_ .
a friend of mine sent me a book called the _UNK_ Bible ,
And one of these _UNK_ is &quot; God . &quot;
In contrast , I know that God is my God . &quot;
And then I read a couple of versions ,
And I wrote down every law I could find .
This is a very long list -- more than 700 law .
And these are some famous laws that I &apos;ve ever heard --
&quot; _UNK_ , &quot; love your neighbor , &quot; many children and many _UNK_ . &quot;
The hundreds of _UNK_ and _UNK_ law in the Bible .
So I decided to stay with a beard ,
This is what I looked like at at the end .
You know , I spent a long time in the airport safety department .
In the final month , my wife refused to _UNK_ me .
The Bible says that you can &apos;t wear a combination of fiber clothing .
So I thought , &quot; That sounds strange , but I &apos;m going to try it . &quot;
The Bible says that if two men were fighting ,
And one of the men &apos;s wife grabbed another man ,
Don &apos;t fight with people , if his wife stood near ,
So -- oh , this is another picture of my beard .
because it &apos;s really changing life , and it &apos;s hard to think about it .
And there are two laws and special challenges .
The first is to avoid the _UNK_ that we make every day .
I could not live in a whole year ,
But the year didn &apos;t say _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ --
I live in New York , and I &apos;m a journalist ,
So my life has 75 to 80 percent , to do that .
But it &apos;s interesting because I can do some improvements
This is one of the major studies that I learned
I almost pretend to be a better person ,
And I really have a little bit of _UNK_ .
I always thought , &quot; You change your mind ,
and the behavior will change , but I find , is often _UNK_ .
When you change behavior , then you change your heart .
So , you know , if you want to be more compassionate ,
the cognitive _UNK_ -- this is what I &apos;ve experienced .
So , if you smile , you get happier ,
The second law that is hard to follow
And these laws are going to let us get a problem .
One obvious example is to take a stone _UNK_ .
It happened -- I was in park and I dressed in my dress --
You know , because it &apos;s just saying , it &apos;s going to influence the mind .
I &apos;d like to know how to _UNK_ my heart .
And this man came to me and said ,
And he said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a male , are you going to fight me ? &quot;
And then I took a bunch of stones out of my pocket
and look forward to this -- and you know , these are _UNK_ --
He was actually a _UNK_ , 70 _UNK_ --
But he was still a male and looked very angry .
and lost my face , and I felt that I could --
&quot; _UNK_ , I can revenge , I &apos;ll lose one in my back .
So this is my _UNK_ experience of stone .
It makes me talk about these important issues , like ,
Why is the Bible so _UNK_ in some parts ?
We should look at it , you know , as it was ,
It &apos;s like a _UNK_ version of the Bible ?
And I want to talk about that .
The Bible reminds us of Wikipedia , because it &apos;s written by many people ,
It &apos;s not a book that goes down from the sky , already _UNK_ .
So I want to end up telling you
just a few _UNK_ and meaningful lessons .
The first is -- you can &apos;t understand the Bible .
Because if you do that , you end up doing something like a _UNK_ ,
OK , this is another one -- I spent a lot of time _UNK_ .
But this is a Bible that we can &apos;t touch women .
in some of the time every month , more _UNK_ --
You can &apos;t sit in the _UNK_ chair for women .
So she did every chair in our house ,
And so I had to stay at most of this year
until I bought a chair and carry with it .
But it was interesting because they were not a fool .
I dare bet their IQ , completely the same person in the evolution .
So _UNK_ the facts , to match their theories .
and then they &apos;re going to be achieved through a fantastic psychological training .
But what I &apos;m going to say is that the museum is pretty glamorous .
is this -- you see a movie about the big floods ,
When you play the flood , you will be _UNK_ by water .
So , no matter how you think about _UNK_ ,
This is a great _UNK_ because I pray ,
Thank you for God , this is a strange thing for _UNK_ .
But I was always grateful to me , whatever time ,
and began to understand hundreds of small things
All those things that I had never noticed before .
the ones that are considered to be --
So , this is the secret of happiness , for me ,
Just remind yourself : when I come here ,
The car had no brakes , and I was not _UNK_ .
And this happened . Because I had just started
is a _UNK_ , but at the end of this year ,
I became a _UNK_ _UNK_ . My friends like me .
But I tried to turn the _UNK_ into a _UNK_ wave .
The basic idea is , whether there is no God ,
We all have some important and wonderful ideas ,
One of my great things in this year is _UNK_ ,
because I was a _UNK_ , so I had this day
I can &apos;t work -- it really changed my life .
So , this is a sacred idea , no God about it .
I spent a lot of time , and I went to a meeting
the different religions in the United States because
but to experience the experience of the American religion .
So I spent my time in _UNK_ , _UNK_ and West _UNK_ .
After three hours , he looked at his watch ,
because I had some of the first ideas , for example ,
It &apos;s hard to say that it &apos;s not going to be explained .
I met a group called _UNK_ Christians ,
They focused on the _UNK_ of the Bible ,
in the old Bible is _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
They said that Jesus had not spoken about gay things .
But when you open it , there &apos;s nothing in it .
So they claim that Jesus talked a lot about helping homeless ,
But I was so shocked that I found
because I learned -- I thought , I thought ,
to distinguish wool and _UNK_ . I asked those _UNK_ people
&quot; Why do the Bible tell us ? Why do God care about it ? &quot;
You will blow the candle on the birthday cake , and this is a rite .
If a guy from Mars saw it ,
He would say , &quot; This guy has a guy who _UNK_ up the cake . &quot;
compared to another person who didn &apos;t wear a _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ would say , &quot; Oh , this guy &apos;s very rational ,
No , so the rituals are not rational .
So the key is to choose the right rituals ,
the _UNK_ rituals -- the _UNK_ itself --
But finally , I learned that you should have some choice .
You have to choose , but anyone who &apos;s following the Bible
The key is : the right part of the choice .
And basically , the word is used for _UNK_ ,
There is also a _UNK_ who wants to _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
So this is about choosing the Bible to compassion ,
not to choose &quot; _UNK_ is a crime , &quot;
in the Bible , it &apos;s a lot of different .
So if we want to find meaning in this book ,
We have to really invest in it and fight with it .
But before the end I thought I was telling a few things .
So I have to pay back in the morning , but I &apos;ve been taken care of all day .
So , no matter how , thank you for giving me a talk .
a lawyer in the town of Nairobi -- _UNK_ ,
Some of you may recognize her through the TED conference --
in a short period of time after election and violence ,
to the _UNK_ of the media platform ,
and the _UNK_ will be collected . And then published .
Unless there &apos;s a automation way to tidy up . &quot;
and said , &quot; We can help you build a automation program . &quot;
It &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to work on the site ,
And that &apos;s what it needs to be .
because what it does is to get it
but nobody knows all of the information --
At the end of the world , the _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
there &apos;s enough people to focus on this site , and it &apos;s got enough value ,
and decided to continue to change it for _UNK_ ,
It was also used to track the snow in Washington .
And you find that _UNK_ uses all over the world ,
At first , it was obvious that the world &apos;s leisure time and time were available .
That &apos;s the time of free data in the 20th century ,
but we don &apos;t have a _UNK_ in the 20th century .
But now , the media that we use --
Internet , mobile phones -- let us do more things , not just consumption ,
And what we &apos;re seeing is that people don &apos;t sit on TV anymore ,
But we also like to create the creation ,
We &apos;ve got a lot of laughter in it .
We are now in a part of the media landscape .
and a lot of the things that are involved in the pattern .
I just want to say , as _UNK_ said ,
And they &apos;ve tried to show the public .
And once they did it , they could make it again ,
There is a space between the _UNK_ works and good works .
that any artist or _UNK_ knows that ,
Now we don &apos;t laugh , we want to get _UNK_ ,
from a single piece of work transition to serious creation .
Free experiments mean freedom to try to experiment anything .
This is a period of curiosity in our history ,
What we do is because we like to do that ,
but not our boss told us to do that ,
And they tested , over 10 years ago ,
_UNK_ theory is the simplest theory of human behavior .
If you don &apos;t want people to do something ,
Just add up to punishment , people don &apos;t do it .
The parents hoped that the parents will be _UNK_ to the children .
At the same time , parents -- probably work , _UNK_ , _UNK_ --
It may be late at the time of the child .
And now they see -- this is the diagram ,
This is the number of weeks , this is the number of children --
So they divided the 10 _UNK_ center into two groups .
But the _UNK_ of the center of the _UNK_ ,
If you take a child ten minutes back ,
We &apos;re going to have you a 10 tin _UNK_ .
until they &apos;re going to add it to three times earlier ,
The parents don &apos;t feel so good for the teacher .
So a few weeks after _UNK_ and _UNK_ --
They said , &quot; Okay , come here . It &apos;s all right . &quot;
what you rely on -- like parents pay salaries --
and when you rely on the social behavior of both parties ,
to create and share people and design .
These are all right . I like a _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and to make the operating of the social world
but it &apos;s really what it really does .
and I &apos;m going to be involved in these projects .
The default pattern of mass action in the 20th century .
We can use them to make everyone happy , we &apos;re going to do it .
In many ways , we &apos;re going to do that , we can do that ,
And I thought that since I was with my friends ,
and try to look back and understand it .
The technological progress seems that we can &apos;t catch up with its steps .
And then you can start to put the slide .
I want to show you not the details of it ,
And this is what we do . This is what we do .
like a lot of the slides that we know ,
This is basically what I &apos;m going to say next .
because I &apos;m going to use a piece of paper .
Well , the answer is , if I use ordinary _UNK_ ,
It looks silly , it looks like a very flat line .
I can take a taxi out of it .
The increase in the number of years is _UNK_ .
Now what I &apos;d like to ask is ,
or it &apos;s going to be a typical _UNK_ .
So I think it &apos;s likely to be that .
If this is , it means that we are now _UNK_
in the world , in the past , in the past ,
And all I asked , I &apos;ve been asking myself ,
is where is the future of the world ?
What is the new age of this trend ?
people are talking about what will happen in 2000 .
And you can see that the future is still in 2000 .
In other words , in my life , in other words ,
It &apos;s going to happen . We can all see it .
We know that three or three of the future
what we &apos;re going to see is how it &apos;s going to happen .
I have to talk about a bunch of things
because I decided to understand the only way
Take a long time off the axis to see it .
And what I &apos;m going to show you is the time
If you look at it from a billion years .
The Earth is so large that the _UNK_ rock
There are some chemicals on the top of it .
We began to figure out how they formed it .
I think some theories are going to be understood
But I want to talk about a simple story of life ,
There are all kinds of different chemicals in it .
And it leads them to _UNK_ chemicals from the outside world .
the most primitive ones that form cells in a way ,
But so far these _UNK_ are not really alive , in our view ,
So every single _UNK_ is a little different .
In fact , the different ways of doing this
_UNK_ , absorb more and more , _UNK_ more .
you can write a way of writing their genetic information ,
so that the record can be copied by the way .
And the amazing thing is that the record
because it came out of the last four years ago .
is exactly the same code , the same way to record .
with the same letter and the code record .
In fact , what I did is I did
is that we can use this code record events .
I &apos;ve got a 100 _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
I tried to check them at the airport safety test .
What I did was I took this code
And there &apos;s a letter that we use to mark it ,
And then I wrote my card to a _UNK_ RNA .
So if somebody had to have millions of cards ,
I &apos;m going to put it in a virus to the house .
And that &apos;s what these cells are starting to exchange and communications ,
so that the cells can form the cells .
Some bacteria know how to get away from the _UNK_ ,
And then it creates this _UNK_ of D acids ,
Now we have a lot of bacteria to _UNK_ ,
In a sense , they were on the same ship ;
That means that if a community is successful ,
and decided to make a _UNK_ acid on a _UNK_ .
And the next interesting stage in life
And it &apos;s interesting that the evolution of evolution
to deal with the structure of information in the community .
In fact , the community began to develop experts
And this is what these cells are doing .
to learn to _UNK_ some kind of fruit
because it was _UNK_ and _UNK_ in the last meal .
It can occur in a life of a single organism ,
And then in this particular information processing structure ,
The individual who ate this fruit fell on the dead .
the fact that organisms have formed this particular structure ,
The most sophisticated version we know is the human language .
Think about it , this is a wonderful invention .
I hope to build a similar chaos in your mind .
It looks like it &apos;s on the front of you
So now we &apos;re going to accelerate the span of time .
And the first step in the story that I &apos;m talking about
And then then , like language and so on ,
and become , I guess , should be more appropriate --
And I think that &apos;s the _UNK_ curve we see here .
It &apos;s not possible to design objects in traditional meaning .
I don &apos;t know how to interact with the machine .
And the machine uses it to be far beyond what we can do ,
and more profound than what we did before .
In fact , sometimes it &apos;s used by the way
Now you &apos;re going to run all these random instructions ,
and choose the most close to what I want . &quot;
In other words , I define what I want .
to find a program that _UNK_ the data .
to do the best thing to do .
in the process of having a kind of mating .
These children _UNK_ the features of two programs .
So I got a new generation of people
and the program that I &apos;m going to show you .
and try it again and in a new generation .
Every program in this generation takes a few seconds .
Or , when it &apos;s complicated , it &apos;s done within hours .
And at the end of the day , I got some
In fact , these programs are much more _UNK_
that any program is going to be efficient .
I tried to read and explain how they work .
In fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they can do tasks
_UNK_ can do what you think of as a program .
In fact , their life is going to work on it .
He took out a card and said , &quot; Look , see .
And it says , &quot; There &apos;s a lot of precision parts of this airplane
In fact , we know the process of engineering
to do a very different process with engineering .
And it allows us to make the production
However , we don &apos;t understand the selection of it .
In some sense , computers are faster than we are .
to be able to run this process faster .
And that &apos;s why I think computer seems to be very _UNK_ .
because all of these technologies are given to themselves .
We are a little bit of a time ,
what _UNK_ is being created in the world .
But I think there must be something that we do with .
that we are the ultimate product of evolution .
that we don &apos;t have to do it yet ,
the latest set of _UNK_ in India
I hope this _UNK_ will continue forever , for a lot of people , for example , I live with this .
The cricket has all the factors of a soap opera :
Like all good _UNK_ , 20 years of interest in the audience
There &apos;s no time limit to the end of the game .
and I went to the board of ships
and the boat was going to be able to sail
when a British _UNK_ said , &quot; How do you think ?
and we &apos;ll win more than half an hour . &quot;
There are two Sunday days . But Sunday is Sunday .
Of course , can &apos;t be used as a cricket . And then after a day of rain ,
So everyone was doing a kind of thing with his friends .
But the reason that a Indians love cricket is that
because we have the same rhythm of life .
_UNK_ is the same way , isn &apos;t it ?
The next day goes to battle and then go home in the evening .
The only _UNK_ of the cricket and the _UNK_
who live in the cricket , and then fight the next day .
but because the cricket is a kind of _UNK_ .
But the Indians love cricket and the other reason
is that you just need a piece of boards
a rubber ball , a couple of partner ,
You can play it in the middle of the _UNK_
You can &apos;t hit any shot in a basketball club because it &apos;s going to hit the wall .
and notice that you don &apos;t have the air conditioning and the wires ,
You can _UNK_ on the banks of the _UNK_ River
And the _UNK_ River has always been so clean .
or on a small floor can be played at the same time .
Even if you don &apos;t know what kind of competition you are .
You &apos;re not going to have five days . So we &apos;ve changed ,
But there is always an accident , in the right time , right place .
And suddenly we fell in love with 50 _UNK_ games
So they are optimistic about the _UNK_ of India .
So they need a carrier to contact with Indians
There are two carriers , one is real , one made up .
And the one that made up was the Indian film .
So one of my friends was sitting in front of me
from the _UNK_ _UNK_ , decided to choose the cricket cricket .
And so there &apos;s a big change in this . Because they begin to _UNK_ the cricket .
The next time the price of five million dollars
and it &apos;s going to be five dollars a second . &quot;
So our cricket movement took place again and again .
And then it says , &quot; The world has to do 20 games better than _UNK_ . &quot;
It was invented cricket in England , and not all over the world .
So , you see , India has to play 20 games better than _UNK_ .
We &apos;d like to go to the World Cup .
But the _UNK_ of _UNK_ forced us to join
And we went into the final , and this time
M _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
He _UNK_ the ball , but the ball gets _UNK_ , how great _UNK_ are .
And suddenly , India found 20 _UNK_ of cricket _UNK_ .
And of course , this victory was actually a _UNK_ of Pakistan .
If he really came to a fast _UNK_ , the ball would be _UNK_ .
Let &apos;s start to believe that India can be the world &apos;s best .
And then the foreign capital went into India .
India has just become more confident about it .
And then the champion gave us a bigger confidence .
They make the world good at their invention .
And it &apos;s not the same way we &apos;re working on a drug .
It &apos;s a _UNK_ for us . We just supported our country --
And there are only two things in India .
One of the Indian forces in the war , of course , we don &apos;t want it to happen .
is that it &apos;s going to come out of the room .
The United States is the country of the league . So , _UNK_ ,
&quot; Okay . Let &apos;s make us develop some _UNK_ in India . &quot;
because in a long time , the cricket was organized in India .
It has never been seen as a commodity market .
and look at them through this beautiful and simple family movement ,
This is a India that people open _UNK_ and _UNK_
And the number of phones per month in this country
But at the same time , it &apos;s a little conservative .
So when people first saw the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Everybody _UNK_ them . But nobody admitted to steal them .
The new owner of India is not the old style .
And there &apos;s a huge amount of money in the back .
_UNK_ is the revenue of television over 10 years .
The other _UNK_ is the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
And what they &apos;re going to do is to attract all the cities
They have to learn the Western set ? After all , we have our own league .
Let me give you an example of how they do it .
Of course , some people say they &apos;re jumping and cricket are not sure to play .
But they said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the way we look at cricket ? &quot;
You &apos;re going to go to your little _UNK_ in that little _UNK_ .
And now , suddenly , if you want a _UNK_ ,
So , for example , the _UNK_ team needs a _UNK_
Is it new to India ? This is a new world .
And as long as you can find somebody who &apos;s beautiful ,
and all of a sudden the _UNK_ of India
You can choose the most beautiful athletes in the world ,
So , _UNK_ _UNK_ can go to _UNK_ and _UNK_
If he had to go back to the Western team ,
They would ask him , &quot; When are you going to get to ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I &apos;ve got to get to a moment , so I must walk today . &quot;
And we would say , &quot; _UNK_ , don &apos;t you have to go ,
but you have to go to that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; I have to go to _UNK_ . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Okay , you &apos;re going to hit the _UNK_ . &quot;
So , he was playing the game , and he went directly from the gym
and the private helicopter , in _UNK_ , you know ,
and the private helicopter , in _UNK_ , you know ,
and the private helicopter , in _UNK_ , you know ,
I never thought anybody would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to give a player ,
than the _UNK_ I use a helicopter
to the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
&quot; Wow , we &apos;ve really arrived at some point .
&quot; Wow , we &apos;ve really arrived at some point .
the cricket , and the movies in India
But what they &apos;re starting to do is because some Indian movies
But what they &apos;re starting to do is because some Indian movies
People began to see the _UNK_ and look at the cricket at the same time .
You can see some of the songs in the cricket game .
And that makes the cricket begin to have a shadow of Indian movies .
And of course , if you &apos;re a _UNK_ team ,
and you &apos;ll see in the video clip , if you do it well ,
This is a reward that works . Look at it .
And of course , _UNK_ , a famous actor in India , was inspired by the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ songs , _UNK_ the audience ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ , India &apos;s national national team , but for _UNK_ .
And you know that the cricket player in Pakistan said _UNK_ ?
I hope I will be able to play a game
because I think we can prove that we can become friends
We can play cricket together , we can become friends .
So the friends of Pakistan , thank you for coming here today .
How do you give a player a _UNK_ ?
It was a cricket who paid 50 _UNK_ a day .
If the game was finished four days , it would only be able to earn 200 _UNK_ .
Now the best Indian _UNK_ , the _UNK_ tests are not absent ,
the most _UNK_ player in the audience
The average contract is _UNK_ million dollars a year .
In other words , they work six days , they can make _UNK_ .
He made a million dollars back and said ,
&quot; I &apos;m making more money in the room and _UNK_ ,
Where did he earn so much money ? He made a little club from India .
six and a half million dollars a week .
Now , you know what the two billion dollars before the game is going to go ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ , India &apos;s famous _UNK_ to the front page of a weekly magazine .
Because of election , _UNK_ is going to move to South Africa
We started three weeks ago in the game ,
Three weeks ago the game began to go to South Africa .
because before the competition began three weeks ago ,
But in the final three weeks , no one is more efficient than us .
Our population is based on a long period of time as _UNK_ our barriers .
We almost turned the cricket into the only movement of India .
It was a shame , but there was no movement in India .
It &apos;s a little bit of a sad thing in our time .
And this is something that &apos;s going to be negative .
For a long time , India was a poor one .
New Delhi _UNK_ -- people &apos;ve heard about new Delhi before India .
And then , in a second , it becomes a _UNK_ land .
&quot; We love India , we like to be there . &quot;
You can &apos;t imagine that once you &apos;re in this place ,
There is no evil here . All the _UNK_ are gone .
and it &apos;s all over time . This is the rule of capitalism .
The theme of today is a movement in India .
And although _UNK_ can be used as a _UNK_ to the world ,
Because if you want to move to other countries ,
You have to make this movement _UNK_
You can &apos;t teach Chinese a unlimited time , war 14 days after the last ,
And so it &apos;s never going to the world .
I hope it will make everyone richer , and hopefully it _UNK_ more .
I hope it will give us more _UNK_ about the cricket _UNK_ .
every day is making decisions ; who wants to know
how to do the right thing -- both financial ,
cooking , or a professional or a love aspect .
Now , if somebody has the ability to guide us
In fact , people who have seen it before _UNK_
And today we &apos;re going to talk about how this is a talent .
And I &apos;ll tell you why even if you know it ,
and it &apos;s not going to be a good thing .
This is the idea of _UNK_ , the original expression .
If this looks like Greek letters , it &apos;s because , it &apos;s really Greek letters .
translated into English -- not as precise as it was .
But basically the main thought of _UNK_ is that
that any prediction of our behavior is worth
or the benefits that are good for us .
And one is the probability of success .
If we could predict these two factors and multiply it .
We always know how to do it ,
And this simple equation , even in the middle of you ,
And the people who don &apos;t like the equation are very easy to understand .
For example , if I tell you that
We _UNK_ the coin , and I threw a coin
the head , and I lose you 10 dollars .
But you &apos;ve got to play with me four dollars .
A lot of people say , _UNK_ , I play with you . Because you know ,
You have 50 percent of the _UNK_ , and you win 10 dollars .
So , of course , it &apos;s going to be fun .
The statistics call the &quot; perfect _UNK_ &quot; --
In the game of the coin , it &apos;s very simple .
but not so simple in everyday life .
People estimate that these two things are bad .
And this is what I &apos;m going to talk about today .
when people are making decisions and making decisions
is going to make two kinds of mistakes .
is that the probability of success in _UNK_
and the value of the success of _UNK_
We first said the first thing to do
It &apos;s easier to calculate the probability of success .
One _UNK_ six sides , one coin two sides , a _UNK_ 52 _UNK_ .
who knows that the probability of _UNK_ A
But it turns out that the details don &apos;t seem so simple
And that &apos;s why Americans spend their time on _UNK_
And the reason is that the probability is not that people calculate
And we &apos;re going to talk about a pig &apos;s problem .
And the question is , you think , you know ,
You &apos;re going to say , of course , the dog is much more .
And you get this dog more conclusions than pigs .
It looks like if you &apos;ve seen a pig . So let &apos;s assume
Now , if you think about the _UNK_ ,
It &apos;s usually right , but you &apos;re wrong .
R &amp; D is the first place in the third or R .
And you &apos;re going to be able to think about
It &apos;s hard to recall , _UNK_ , Park , at least a lot of slow .
But in fact , more than in the English language
And the third letter is the _UNK_ word
to think that these words are going to slow .
but because our brain is based on the first letter ,
You send a _UNK_ , you can think of a bunch of words .
And the three letters are often _UNK_ ,
And so this is an example of this .
that suggests that the size of your probability
This is going to lead you wrong . It &apos;s not just _UNK_ games .
For example , we &apos;ve done a survey in the United States , asking them to predict
and all kinds of _UNK_ are going to happen .
It &apos;s going to be estimated that every year
These are all the same people as me .
_UNK_ the number of deaths : _UNK_ , fireworks , _UNK_ and _UNK_
a very interesting phenomenon , first of all ,
Two numbers are bigger than _UNK_ : _UNK_ and fireworks
When you read the front page of the newspaper ,
And it &apos;s easy to think about it .
and in the national day , the head was burned .
And in the mind it &apos;s not so deep , so
In fact , it seems like &quot; The _UNK_ _UNK_ . &quot;
&quot; Which option is different from other options ? &quot; You think
is different from the swimming pool because of the swimming pool .
is actually the most dangerous thing to do !
The chance of death in the pool is that
than the sum of the other three _UNK_
_UNK_ is a good case -- it &apos;s the chance that people can calculate
_UNK_ -- you know , you buy _UNK_ in the middle , please excuse me that --
At least _UNK_ , it was a _UNK_ ticket
to pay for a stupid tax because of buying a ticket
It &apos;s the same thing to wash the money .
At least you don &apos;t have to go to the store and buy it .
Why do you have somebody who buy the ticket ticket ?
_UNK_ , obviously , one of them must be
We see a lot of winners , right ? One of the first prize for the couple .
or Ed _UNK_ in your _UNK_ , with a huge cheque ,
How do you want to spend this big sum of money ?
We &apos;ve seen it in television ; we &apos;ve seen it in the newspaper .
But when you see the massive interview ,
Now , this is a hundred million people
and tell you what you &apos;re going to say ,
If you look at nine and a half years of television ,
don &apos;t have a _UNK_ -- you see a _UNK_
And then the last 30 seconds has a &quot; I won ! &quot;
The possibility of buying a ticket will be a lot smaller .
Now I &apos;m going to show you that there &apos;s a ticket here
nine of them have sold to different people .
A _UNK_ ticket , if you win it ,
You &apos;re going to get 20 dollars , how is this game ?
The _UNK_ of this ticket is two dollars .
It &apos;s going to be able to buy
You don &apos;t buy it ? Most people don &apos;t buy it .
the chance to win is not going to happen .
But it &apos;s easier to see who &apos;s going to win .
And obviously the _UNK_ will win , right ?
You can &apos;t say , &quot; I have the chance to win with other people . &quot;
It &apos;s obvious that your _UNK_ is not going to be the same .
And all the tickets are _UNK_ by a person
And even though it doesn &apos;t affect the probability ,
The probability may look more complex , but it &apos;s not
to figure out how much value we like it .
I want to talk about the error of _UNK_ .
How much money is a Big Mac ? Was it 25 dollars ?
And all of you have is &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
However , decided whether a Big Mac was worth 25 dollars .
is you &apos;re going to ask one , just ask a question :
If you were to fly to Australia in _UNK_
And you know that there &apos;s no food on the plane
And when you sit in the front of you ,
the McDonald &apos;s box , the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
It was 25 dollars in this 16 hours .
I couldn &apos;t even _UNK_ it -- the lighter had been _UNK_ :
Suddenly , 25 dollars to buy a Big Mac is a bargain .
In turn , if you go to a poor country ,
there &apos;s 25 bucks for a _UNK_ dinner , so the Big Mac looked so expensive .
Why are you telling me a certain set of conditions
is that the answer should be &quot; _UNK_ ? &quot;
because it &apos;s a little bit better than that .
to buy a Big Mac , not a problem .
&quot; I can do what I can do with these money . &quot;
compared with other possible consumption , you compare the past ,
What you think is , you &apos;ve spent three dollars on a Big Mac , 25 dollars now ?
It &apos;s wrong , and I can prove to you
and then this thing looks very _UNK_ .
We &apos;ve done a experiment , looking at people &apos;s ideas about two jobs .
a job promise you &apos;re going to be _UNK_ , and then 50,000 ,
And it &apos;s going to take a wages every year .
And the other job is to promise you to pay
people would want to get a second job , even though
Do you know that this job is getting less money ?
because they felt that they were worse than paid .
Even though the total income of the wages is higher .
There &apos;s a 2,000 dollar holiday products , and now it &apos;s only 1600 dollars .
If you want to Hawaii , you won &apos;t buy this product ?
Most people are going to be . Now it &apos;s going to change a little bit .
2000 dollars of holiday products are now sold at 700 dollars .
And you decided to think about a week
And then the best price of the travel agency has not been .
Now you need 1500 dollars . How many people say , &quot; No !
Why ? Because I &apos;ve only sold 700 , I won &apos;t spend 1500 .
to give people a lot of good deal , in other words ,
A transaction from a better price is still a good deal , or not .
A poor deal can be _UNK_ from a higher price .
And there &apos;s an example of how to compare the past
You &apos;ve got a ticket for 20 dollars ,
and found that the ticket had been lost .
Can you get the rest of the money to buy one ?
Now , I &apos;m only going to change a condition
You &apos;ve got two dollars for your money ,
when I arrived at the theater , I found that there was a chance
You won &apos;t have 20 dollars to buy a ticket ?
And of course , I went to the theater and looked at it .
I don &apos;t have 20 dollars on my way .
In both cases , this is a piece of paper .
In one case , the paper has a head of America &apos;s head and no other paper .
And the difference is , when you lose the ticket , you say ,
you &apos;re going to spend it now -- 40 dollars .
than 20 dollars , it &apos;s going to be _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to lead a lot of problems
But even if it wasn &apos;t the past , it was possible
I &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples
When things are compared to another thing , it will change value .
So , in 1992 , _UNK_ , for us ,
the people who stand in the political world
And of course , the retail _UNK_ knew it .
And they use this to make you feel
When you walk into a red wine store ,
to buy a bottle of wine and wine
You see the price of wine : 8 , 27 , 33 dollars , how do you do ?
So they choose the price of _UNK_
If you &apos;re a clever retail , you &apos;ll put a most expensive commodity in _UNK_
because there were 33 dollars in the red wine ,
And the question is , this is 33 dollars later ,
His value is not related to the wine that was next to the original .
what we did at the beginning was to make
that we &apos;re trying to decide how much we like .
When we consume it or use it , the initial comparisons have not existed .
I &apos;m going to show you a quick experiment
And these experiments are going to be done
How many minutes later do you enjoy the _UNK_ ?
The experiment was sitting in front of the _UNK_ ,
For some experiments , they are in another corner of the room , something else .
Some are a box of chocolate , some are a jar of _UNK_ .
In fact , the things that change in the corner
_UNK_ is expected to enjoy the _UNK_ of _UNK_
and it &apos;s going to be a great _UNK_
However , how would they eat the French _UNK_ ?
You don &apos;t need a psychologist to tell you
when you &apos;re in the mouth of the mouth , and the _UNK_ ,
is not going to affect your taste at all .
This is a very _UNK_ process in which we eat .
You have a personal experience , even if you haven &apos;t had before ,
to my lab to eat _UNK_ . And I have a question :
You &apos;re selling 200 dollars near your home ,
If you drive through town , if you buy a hundred dollars ,
Can you drive for the five _UNK_ to save 100 dollars ?
They can &apos;t imagine the amount of money
to buy a _UNK_ at the other end of the city .
Now I assume you &apos;re going to have a _UNK_ car .
You get a dealer next to your house for $ _UNK_ .
and drive through the city , just as long as you can
you &apos;re going to save _UNK_ , and it &apos;s 100 dollars .
A lot of people say , &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to drive over town
to save 100 dollars to buy a car .
And this idea is _UNK_ , and it &apos;s really supposed to be
because you save that 100 dollars , please !
When you go to the supermarket , it &apos;s not going to say
I was saved from the car , or the _UNK_ ,
I &apos;m a fool to save the car . It &apos;s money !
If you drive over 100 dollars in the city , it &apos;s worth 100 dollars .
No matter what you &apos;re going to save . But people don &apos;t think that .
This is why people don &apos;t care about the fund manager .
Take care of _UNK_ or _UNK_ from their investment .
But they will collect a discount for less than one dollar .
Now , you see , it &apos;s also a question of _UNK_ .
because you &apos;re going to be more than 100 dollars
And when you go to the money , you don &apos;t do that again .
For example , if you &apos;re a American , go to France ,
There might be a couple of couples in France
Oh ! These people are really passionate about me .
than those who hate me to try to explain
I hate the people who don &apos;t speak French ,
The couple was so good , so you went to France with them .
And then you go home and invite the couple to dinner at home ,
They &apos;re bored and closed , right ? In the new environment ,
This is not the same . In fact , you find
They &apos;re _UNK_ enough to apply for French citizenship .
And if you go to the audio , you &apos;ll meet the same problem .
You go to a _UNK_ store , you see two _UNK_ .
One is the smooth face of a stone , a _UNK_ appearance .
And then you try and think that it really _UNK_ them .
So you pay the money , and you pay the sound ,
and don &apos;t care about the _UNK_ style of the home .
The problem is that you &apos;re doing something called &quot; _UNK_ . &quot;
You don &apos;t go back to that _UNK_ store and say ,
The problem is that the _UNK_ is over time
People often seem particularly difficult when they make decisions .
So , in general , there are two simple principles
Now I &apos;m going to give you a very simple question , and it &apos;s a simple question .
Now you get $ 60 or $ 50 , what do you want ?
This is called the _UNK_ IQ test ,
you want to get more money in the world .
Can you get $ 60 or 60 a month later , what do you choose ?
because we know , &quot; Well , it &apos;s better than &quot; _UNK_ &quot;
When these two rules _UNK_ each other , it &apos;s difficult to get together .
For example , you get $ 50 or 50 a month later , where do you choose ?
There &apos;s a lot of things like this in life .
So what do people do in this context ?
That means that they &apos;re going to ask a lot of interest
to be able to delay their _UNK_ .
and wait for the next 10 dollars a month .
Maybe it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s strange .
It &apos;s easy to get people to do that , just change
to give the money a little bit of time
Imagine you get 50 dollars a year -- that &apos;s 12 months later .
People are ready to wait , since they &apos;ve been waiting for 12 months ,
This is a _UNK_ that I just mentioned .
If I give you enough time to respond , you &apos;ll see
and people find that 50 dollars now are better than
there &apos;s more value for the next 60 dollars .
but it &apos;s only about 30 days of difference .
But when we _UNK_ the decision for one year ,
Now , why do you see the results of this ?
One is bigger than another one : _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
They &apos;re going to go back until they &apos;re gone .
This _UNK_ is never going to be smaller than _UNK_ , never won .
But the gap between them is getting smaller .
You start to see a gap in an inch , and it &apos;s about three inches .
And then it was _UNK_ , and then they disappeared from the horizon .
And that &apos;s what I just showed you .
that you see the height of the different stages
Now I want you to see , two things are really true .
First of all , they look closer and closer ,
Second , the fire player is always higher than the player .
But what happens when we let something disappear ?
If we look very close , _UNK_ are bigger than fire players .
As Plato said , the time of value is as much as the size of space .
This is the answer to the difficult problem .
What you can see is that our two _UNK_ are set up .
and people think it &apos;s going to be better than the future .
And here &apos;s a little bit more _UNK_ than that .
Now there was some confusion , and the comparisons came back in a moment .
We see that people want to get 50 dollars
not to wait for a month , but in the _UNK_ time , it will decide to turn back .
And we see a funny phenomenon -- that &apos;s what happens .
people will change their minds in the future .
When you get to 12 months , you &apos;ll say ,
Why would you like to wait for that 60 bucks a month ?
So , at the end of the day , you know ,
If we &apos;re all so stupid , how do we go to the moon ?
because I can talk about two hours here , for example ,
It turns out that humans are _UNK_ and values .
And the answer to this question , I think you know ,
I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;ve heard before .
Now , our brain is going to be a completely different world evolution .
and all around us are the same people
People &apos;s lives are very short , very few choices .
The most important thing is , &quot; There is no _UNK_ at present . &quot;
the gift of _UNK_ , the little equation that tells us
In this world of nature , we should think about problems ,
of why we think about it , and we tell us
And it &apos;s important to try and make it work .
will be able to master the species in their hands .
that are often responsible for the extinction of the species .
There &apos;s only one thing , the only thing that can destroy us
And if we die in 10,000 years , the reason is that
And we couldn &apos;t get the talent of this .
because we _UNK_ the future of suffering .
We have some time to ask Dan . The first question here is the second question .
It &apos;s also a way to _UNK_ our terrorist
Is there any way to overcome it ?
and the _UNK_ of the land , which is probably about
American defence funds should be used to make the border safer projects
I tried to tell them that terrorism was just a word .
is the psychological response to a series of events .
If they were really worried about terrorism , they should ask a question .
what led to terrorism and how people don &apos;t fear ,
And so the way that I &apos;m going to talk about
In fact , the U.S. media reports on this kind of event
Excuse me , the number of terrorist attacks are very small .
We know , for example , in the United States ,
more people have died because there was no death .
because they were afraid of being scared
If I tell you that there &apos;s a plague
so that the United States is going to die next year .
If you don &apos;t know it &apos;s &quot; cold , you might be very _UNK_ .
These small events , we should be _UNK_ ,
is to allow those who are trying to _UNK_ our goal .
Dan , I want to ask _UNK_ . You mean ,
We respond to terrorism , is a defect in the spirit ?
So the big country , the good people . But on the other hand ,
When a bus exploded , 30 people were killed .
because you don &apos;t have a _UNK_ belt death .
What is the spirit of this kind of spirit ? It &apos;s an _UNK_ effect .
Is it a international attack that is _UNK_ by foreigners ?
Yes , a lot of factors , you tell some of these
First of all , a human organization tried to kill us .
instead of a _UNK_ tree that happened to us .
Secondly , our enemy may hit us again .
people were killed by _UNK_ , not from normal reasons .
It &apos;s a normal reason , but sometimes people think about it .
So this is a great number of factors together .
It becomes a remarkable event , but we don &apos;t forget about it .
When people read about the content , the sales of the newspaper will be better .
And so the media had a lot to do
I mean , how do you get that emotion ?
And everyone was angry , and after a half hours ,
At least when I was here , a shop that was 150 yards away
the explosion -- I went back to the hotel
a plan for a good wedding to be done
And she said , we never let them _UNK_ our wedding .
I mean , this is a society that has become accustomed to .
And of course , there are other societies -- how do you learn
to survive in a limited terrorist threat , not to worry too much about it ,
like the people in the middle of us who don &apos;t have a terrorist attack .
But the fear is not that rational ?
And the reason that we fear is because
And of course , if we knew that the attack was the worst ,
-- of course , maybe more than 30 people --
I &apos;m not saying -- I &apos;m going to quote someone else ,
&quot; terrorism is not terrible that we should not be so nervous . &quot;
should be the threat to the face of the world
I think it &apos;s not that people are doing this .
And today we hear so many of the talks
how many people stood up and said ,
poverty ! What is the cause of us !
People get up in the morning ; they don &apos;t care about poverty .
poverty is not going to be a headline ; it &apos;s a little bit _UNK_ .
I mean , if you have to solve one of these problems ,
poverty , from the importance of importance , is certainly the first priority .
_UNK_ has already had a nuclear weapon ,
A nuclear weapon is still more difficult for terrorism .
If that judgment is wrong , we are all stupid .
Even though that was true , there were more people who died of poverty
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be
In the ancient times , we don &apos;t know about disease .
so you don &apos;t have to spend too much energy
If you &apos;re attacked , what can be done
Do you know that all the problems of evolution
My guess is that from the _UNK_ of humanity
never had anything to do . But if you were looking for it ,
Most of them have a &quot; _UNK_ &quot; -- they &apos;re afraid
the animals that we &apos;ve seen are not possible .
than those animals that have never seen before .
So , when a school explosion , we &apos;ve never seen that before .
I don &apos;t think that this is a particular mechanism
It &apos;s like you &apos;ve seen it , but it &apos;s probably more base .
You know , the economist likes to talk about
those who buy the _UNK_ . But I suspect
when you accused of these people , you make the same mistakes .
And it turns out that the value of buying tickets is not _UNK_ .
a common player for about 150 dollars a year .
This player actually knows that he &apos;s going to lose .
but it &apos;s going to buy 150 dollars a year , why ?
This is not because he has a problem
to release a _UNK_ in the brain that makes people happy .
In a way , investment is one dollar ,
you can get a lot more fun than the toilet .
If you take the money , you don &apos;t have a good feeling .
So many people think that economists are more foolish
In short , humans can go to the moon
That &apos;s because there was no opinions of economists , thank you .
OK , your ideas are good . But there &apos;s a _UNK_ to look at :
and the degree of &quot; _UNK_ &quot; after the winners .
The next day the _UNK_ will not feel so bad .
And even in the instant of the success of the success ,
I don &apos;t agree to those who know they &apos;re going to lose .
Maybe they don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be big , but it might happen .
So they would prefer to buy _UNK_ instead of _UNK_ .
But I also see your point : it &apos;s true ,
It &apos;s going to be useful for people to buy _UNK_ .
There &apos;s a lot of good reasons why you don &apos;t listen to economists
It &apos;s not one of them , but it &apos;s a lot of other reasons .
what I &apos;ve done is I &apos;m more likely to die than everything else .
I study aging -- and I hope what can be done in this field
The reason why people don &apos;t care too much about aging
because it looks like cancer when aging is about to live .
or a heart attack . What advice do you have ?
It &apos;s a very difficult thing to get people to look at .
But there is a psychologist who is a good thing .
That &apos;s what &apos;s more vivid and more realistic about the future .
to do the future decision and the current decision
is that people are going to expect
You can actually find a lot of detail
_UNK_ and long-term environment , people start using the same
Do you want to get extra $ _UNK_ in 65 places ?
When you &apos;re 65 years old , you &apos;re still alive .
what kind of stuff is , how much hair is going to be .
Once we want to know all the details of the future ,
And we suddenly feel that _UNK_ is important .
So when you retire , you get rich
I felt that you were struggling with the fundamental human nature .
This book is the beginning . This is the cover .
Or we can roll down to the bottom page ,
If we want to zoom in a page ,
You just fold it up and put it back in the book .
It &apos;s the same way ; you pick it up and zoom it up .
_UNK_ will be with you and explain all the pictures .
In this picture , you can see the _UNK_ map .
_UNK_ the map , and see what it is .
_UNK_ : The most modern wind plan is composed of _UNK_ .
We can shrink it up , put it on the page ,
Or we can shrink it to the _UNK_ ,
But one of the most cool things in this book
any amount of energy is converted into the house --
The whole book is not just running on the iPad .
In the living room , you can start reading on the iPad .
and then reading it on the iPhone .
_UNK_ the publisher immediately set up an easy tool for content .
So the _UNK_ media team is on the East Coast --
We &apos;re creating this software on the west coast --
CA : So you want this software to publish publishers .
And this is for me , because I &apos;m not accustomed to doing this ,
I usually stand on the other side of the _UNK_ .
Now I felt that I had given pressure to other people , and that was not a _UNK_ .
This background is about the power of my work , my power , and I lost my mind .
and trying to find the answers to those _UNK_ problems .
But this _UNK_ , I mean , I &apos;m going to do this here , and it feels like
-- one of my favorites , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
In France , after a few years of learning ,
He came home and asked him , what did you make ?
What do you get when you leave so many years ?
And he took a couple of _UNK_ to them ,
And obviously , &quot; Do you spend a few years doing this ? &quot;
But let me feel so deep that I understand the little things
is a life exploration , thought and everything .
I think I &apos;m going to go home and talk about
I &apos;m going to start with a piece of work
And two _UNK_ and some of the clips
I don &apos;t want to leave you in a moment .
Why don &apos;t you even find a job for a job ?
I &apos;ve been committed to Queen and to the country , and now I &apos;m going to live for myself .
No , now you &apos;re going to be like a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , it &apos;s time to waste my time with you .
_UNK_ , depressed people like me were _UNK_ by life .
What &apos;s good for you ? I mean , it &apos;s not just a job .
_UNK_ , and _UNK_ . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s all _UNK_ away .
If I have , you &apos;re _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to use it .
How many _UNK_ are you going to fight with you ?
and he said that he had no ability to express himself
You see you , now I &apos;m going to take my _UNK_
the people who are _UNK_ , the white _UNK_ , the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , no one can hate the _UNK_ ,
And it &apos;s not saying that he &apos;s doing bad , it &apos;s kind of _UNK_ .
Now , what do you say directly to me ?
They &apos;re better than those who don &apos;t want to look at the film ,
You don &apos;t have a chance to leave Hollywood
Newton : Thank you . My first piece of paper
is really trying to grab the film in my sense .
in the film world , and I &apos;m going to be in the world ?
The first clip is a young woman talked about Nigeria .
She felt that she would be happy there .
This is the emotional of the people from home .
is that I experience , and I &apos;m still experiencing emotion ,
I had a good day in the house , for five years ,
And this film was filmed in 1997 .
This is the period of _UNK_ rule
the worst day in Nigeria , after the colonial period ,
is that we are longing for our home
It &apos;s kind of romantic , but I think it &apos;s beautiful .
because you just need a big investment .
It took us to the next clip , with young people ,
about the lack of opportunities in the black world
transparent glass ceiling , we all know , are talking about
Again , this is what I &apos;m talking about .
when the _UNK_ culture of the U.K.
And what I want to say is that this term
_UNK_ culture has a meaning to people &apos;s real life .
What kind of a child like Jim _UNK_ ,
I mean , the anger that he had in his heart
We &apos;re talking about the Jews and the conclusion
We &apos;re talking about South Africa , L.A. and so on .
and it &apos;s going to continue , in a _UNK_ way ,
Like two years ago , I happened in France
And in France , I felt like , four years ago ,
And look at the third clip . And the third part , for me , is this :
What does the film mean to you ? What do you want to convey ?
a young director , Hollywood director , with his friends
And I think that &apos;s the beginning of my work .
When I was born , I was born in _UNK_
It was a couple of months before the _UNK_ war ,
All child &apos;s time _UNK_ me to take this clip
In _UNK_ , you &apos;re going to go to the battle .
You have to be ready , and you have to sacrifice
and it &apos;s going to be done by a gun .
is a _UNK_ . This is your life .
This is your life . This is , this is your life .
They let us eat a special drug . We call the bubble .
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ , the soldiers were _UNK_
_UNK_ , the _UNK_ , the soldiers were _UNK_
We went from a village to another village , three villages ,
He knows that we don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t know !
? We don &apos;t have more trouble than that ?
And in front of the _UNK_ , you get a _UNK_ ,
The blind man looked at it , and the diamond was in his pocket .
You &apos;re going to go back to war , right ?
We hope that under the help of you and others , the committee
to understand the source of the insurgency after working on it .
And more of that , we started _UNK_ , and eventually ,
And the end of the country &apos;s history was _UNK_ .
My sister , she &apos;s a _UNK_ , she &apos;s _UNK_ .
Mr. _UNK_ , I want to remind you that you &apos;re not right now .
you have to _UNK_ all the soldiers in the world
The war was crime , but I never launched the war .
_UNK_ education is the way they control rights .
I &apos;d like to ask you to pay education in your country ?
Would you like to ask anybody here , who has seen a real diamond ?
Mr. _UNK_ , I want to remind you that you &apos;re not here today .
Newton : Thank you . I &apos;m going to talk about my key .
is that when we get to the point of success ,
What we do , for me , I think we should
a very strong theme of the relationship ,
is what we see in the clip , a young generation of psychology
They &apos;re children , and they &apos;re going to be a _UNK_ .
When we realized that they were damaged and didn &apos;t have any value
What do you want to say about this ?
Newton : In the course of my investigation , in fact ,
I spent some time studying this in Sierra _UNK_ .
I remember that I met a lot of _UNK_
But I remember coming back to the last day
I remember being _UNK_ , and I kept thinking about it .
If these kids , if any child in the Western countries
that kids have experienced , just a day of life ,
They &apos;re not going to be able to treat it .
So for me , for all the children &apos;s _UNK_
This is a generation of kids , we have a whole generation of kids
was forced to suffer such a serious psychological injury .
_UNK_ : We thank you again for the TED stage .
_UNK_ : I heard a scientist in the morning
All of a sudden thought of himself as a scientist .
When I was fourteen years old , my parents bought me a chemical instrument .
So I did a hydrogen _UNK_ , a set of oxygen .
I got two tubes , and I got a _UNK_ ,
And then the glass -- and I turned around ,
_UNK_ : The people in the street came up and knocked ,
Mr. _UNK_ on the left is a very famous , probably _UNK_ .
Frank , you &apos;ve climbed to the incredible height of life .
I mean , for a artist -- a architect --
to become the blade of the time you belong to .
I mean you &apos;re successful , even if you &apos;re _UNK_ about the fact ,
because it &apos;s funny -- you know , it &apos;s a strange idea .
You give the building a _UNK_ , it can be used in advertising .
And you have -- the status of non - rock star , it &apos;s famous ,
that can do most of the time in life .
And what you do is you make
to work for the rest of the world ,
But it &apos;s interesting to a creative person ,
This is one of the _UNK_ states -- we &apos;re creating a time --
how to do the maximum and keep on ego ,
This gives you a profit -- even more win .
It &apos;s not a question , but you can talk about it .
I &apos;m the one who has the _UNK_ type
You must _UNK_ the employers and your team .
And I realized that I walked into the room ,
And that &apos;s what I respond to people and that era .
In fact , that was my response to my employer .
They &apos;re not too rich , so they can &apos;t afford too good materials .
I knew I had to make my house , and my wife became a employer .
We bought a small house in the _UNK_ ,
to build a house with about 50,000 dollars .
It was a little late that night , we drank a lot of wine .
_UNK_ , standing in the middle of the big desert , he said --
&quot; Have you ever thought about building more _UNK_ ,
there will be people in the next 2000 . &quot;
So I thought -- yeah , maybe it &apos;s a good idea .
I was lucky , and then I found some _UNK_ employers ,
And then I found that the world will never be for you .
I &apos;m not going to look at the world .
_UNK_ work , do not know what the results will be .
If I knew everything in front of me , I would stop .
If I could predict or plan , I would not continue .
But of course , my confidence has _UNK_ through time ,
I was actually running a business in a business ,
in the process of doing the project ,
as the _UNK_ said -- I could quote him --
When the _UNK_ project ended , I looked at it ,
I think _UNK_ -- how did I get that ?
How do I make this whole shape or how to _UNK_ the place ?
I &apos;ve been able to look at it for years , and I &apos;m not fighting it ,
When you walk through the corner of the building , you find a place to agree with the streets ,
And it seems to have a passion with buildings ,
_UNK_ : So what about the New York project ?
_UNK_ came to me with a _UNK_ and _UNK_ it ,
And I think he doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing .
So I thought he was _UNK_ and Phoenix .
He &apos;s already done _UNK_ -- and then he &apos;s up again .
I don &apos;t feel good about the _UNK_ site , but not to say it &apos;s built on it .
_UNK_ : How long is it going to be ,
_UNK_ : To go to September or October of 2003 .
I hope _UNK_ , _UNK_ and all the musicians
Fortunately , today &apos;s work with me , most of the people I love ,
_UNK_ may be the number of factors ,
He has always been a captain of the _UNK_ .
That project and not a lot of people involved in architecture ,
So , you know , I found people like this ,
It &apos;s hard to get something on the building like that .
Richard wanted to add a library and some of the facilities for students .
I persuaded him to take me to another architect ,
It was also _UNK_ by the _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
His early work was similar to my early work .
I started trying to do something that was done
You can think of the _UNK_ roof in Spain .
And I understood that language was the beginning ,
There are so many _UNK_ that have been there ,
The architecture elements are too _UNK_ to be able to --
I mean , Charlie made a lot of these things ,
and forms a modern language that _UNK_ with history .
I &apos;ve been feeling that he can come to _UNK_
I tried to give him some projects , but there was no success .
And I love working with people like this , it &apos;s a good idea .
I used to _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ _UNK_ , who worked with other musicians ,
like jazz -- you can _UNK_ , you play together .
For me , this is a way to understand a city ,
_UNK_ : Is it going to build near the existing site ?
and it &apos;s going to be in the middle --
You can come to the opening ceremony , and I &apos;ll invite _UNK_
No , but the construction of democracy is interesting ,
And every one of these things will create a very _UNK_ situation ,
And if you can _UNK_ the other way --
to be more _UNK_ in terms of respect ,
and not only depends on the construction model of an architect .
I &apos;ve seen the _UNK_ you showed at TED .
_UNK_ &apos;s surprise is that it is adapted to each other in the city .
That &apos;s the _UNK_ , the highway around the world ,
will stand up and talk about their own work ,
like to tell all of you are a good guy ,
and it &apos;s like trying to _UNK_ himself --
It &apos;s like that , it &apos;s going to be certain that your job is done well .
I mean , I should treat the truth , like dealing with gravity ,
If the project is _UNK_ , you can &apos;t get a lot of projects .
MIT -- they did the project for me ,
They spent three days in the rain every day .
They &apos;re actually hidden anywhere in the _UNK_ _UNK_ , understand ?
I can &apos;t be innocent ! The place is _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
Yes , no house could have a problem with water , so that --
_UNK_ : A reputation - a moment in Los Angeles is &quot; _UNK_ water &quot; .
_UNK_ : You &apos;ve all heard about the story of _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been doing another project for some years .
to build a _UNK_ on the beach of Simon .
His secretary , a _UNK_ lady , who was serious ,
I &apos;ll tell her the story of the _UNK_ story .
I mean -- I can &apos;t say , &quot; What about that ? &quot;
You &apos;re a nice guy -- you &apos;re a nice guy .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been interested in .
is that -- a personal expression of expression
And it &apos;s all the basic conditions that we have
is , &quot; How do you get most people to hire architects --
The architect is to be done by the _UNK_ project .
They don &apos;t understand the value of an architect .
_UNK_ : In a period of time , some _UNK_ , people --
when _UNK_ was very popular , in the _UNK_ --
_UNK_ : I did a _UNK_ , but nobody bought a _UNK_ .
The design that people want to _UNK_ is not leaving a _UNK_ ?
When the _UNK_ open -- it &apos;s about _UNK_ , I don &apos;t remember it --
They find you , at least two times ,
I even went to _UNK_ with a whole team
because there are all kinds of _UNK_ and signature --
They wanted me to build a building in the harbour .
I asked them what they wanted to do
&quot; You come to us and tell you -- &quot; _UNK_ like this .
They called us and arranged a very good hotel .
They took us to go out of the ocean
We see the landscape of the _UNK_ harbor
And then the plan was to take lunch with the mayor .
that table could have this carpet for a long time .
We sat down and we drank some water ,
&quot; What can I do for you , Mr. _UNK_ ? &quot;
And they follow -- and they follow us , and they said ,
&quot; Are you going to have lunch with the mayor ? &quot;
And they took us there to take this _UNK_
_UNK_ : I &apos;m going to collect the wind , almost at the end of the conversation .
Do you want to say that I am or yourself ?
_UNK_ : I was , I &apos;d like to experience the sensation of applause , so --
_UNK_ : Be sure to have the opportunity ! Don &apos;t forget to give you _UNK_ !
But if you think about it from my profession ,
There are some studies that can measure the effect ,
If the patient believed that they were _UNK_ , they would have a distinct effect on them .
I want to start showing you a _UNK_ ,
I &apos;ll tell you how I &apos;m going to be . This is a
In the &apos; 50s , the simple _UNK_ of every child &apos;s _UNK_ book .
when I was in the 1970s , I was going to go from _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to show you the first , and then I &apos;ll explain it again .
This knife , you can check it ; my hand , you can check it .
I hold the knife in my head like this .
and make sure that nothing can work on my sleeve
I &apos;m going to press my wrist like this .
So you can see that there &apos;s no time to make
anything that &apos;s going to happen . If I &apos;m _UNK_ here ,
Well , this is a lesson that I often teach .
the magic of a magician , because you can learn
It &apos;s a magic trick -- although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
It &apos;s probably a lot of people who know this magic trick .
I said I &apos;m going to hold my wrist .
to make sure that there &apos;s nothing to do with my sleeve ,
And in my hand , I &apos;m going to move to you
And this finger , my index index will be _UNK_ .
It seems that there &apos;s a lot of childhood over there .
And we can talk about why this is _UNK_ ,
Why don &apos;t you notice that there are three fingers below this ,
because your consciousness , and the way we deal with consciousness ,
It &apos;s one , two , three . It &apos;s got them together .
But that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk today . Right ? I &apos;ll open my hand .
I &apos;m going to close my fingers , the same thing ,
in some sense , the _UNK_ of my fingers .
I _UNK_ this knife . You take this knife out .
This trick you can do with your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
What is the relationship between the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ ?
I read a study about a year ago ,
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this is for me ,
A _UNK_ is a form of white pills ,
If it is a round white pill , it has a definite _UNK_ effect .
But if you change the shape of the _UNK_ ,
and color the blue , and the minute letter ,
But the white pill is that there &apos;s no blue effects .
But in fact , that &apos;s not the end .
There &apos;s a color capsules , the end of the yellow , the red end .
&#91; at &#93; the cost of _UNK_ and _UNK_ &#93; .
of the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ of medicine .
In their minds , this is a very powerful imagination ,
And this is a really powerful imagination , when there &apos;s a slide ,
The white pill doesn &apos;t have a blue pill .
There is no capsule , there is no _UNK_ in it .
and they don &apos;t really have a real _UNK_ .
I want to see if I can take this idea
And it &apos;s a little bit of a fake trick .
If you want the actual effect , you take a injection needle .
This is a _UNK_ cap . It &apos;s very sharp .
I &apos;m going to have it a lot of poison .
This is my skin . This is not Hollywood special .
to take this _UNK_ through the other side .
If you &apos;re easily _UNK_ -- some of your friends perform
And yesterday , some people didn &apos;t know ,
you &apos;d better see it in the next 30 seconds ,
In fact , you know , I &apos;ll start doing bad things at the back .
You &apos;ll see , you can see that if you think about it .
My arm &apos;s _UNK_ , and I &apos;m going to do it .
and I walked through my skin a little bit ,
Now , we basically did this with a knife ,
But you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
So let me show you this . One , two .
I know what people want when they see this .
and _UNK_ his skin for a few minutes . &quot;
And the people behind them said , &quot; Okay . I don &apos;t really see that . &quot;
The people in the remote room are now _UNK_ .
Let me give you a look at this .
This is my skin . This is not Hollywood special .
And that &apos;s my meat , and I can rotate it .
or in the back of the video a few years later ,
and say , &quot; Wow , that looks a little bit less lacking .
some of the effects , but if this is true ,
Look at this hole , it &apos;s also a hole , if it really _UNK_ him .
Let me give you the blood to you .
I &apos;ll wash my arm and show you I &apos;m not hurt ,
I &apos;ll see you in the next few days .
I want you to look forward to this . Thank you very much .
The theme and the _UNK_ are a kind of
is already in the theme of your mind .
and everything that &apos;s related to it is the subject &apos;s _UNK_ .
I think maybe six years ago , I was invited
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
And I &apos;m really hard to think about it .
How do you do a painting based on _UNK_
And then I realized that I could look at him as a natural way .
And that means that I &apos;m looking at the skin
It &apos;s like looking out of the window as a common tree .
But it really started to create some themes and _UNK_ .
And here is the great painting of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
Since I realized that I could be satisfied with this topic ,
It &apos;s just a series of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
What is it that he always _UNK_ the side .
And then I thought I could move them a little bit more .
And so in history they first looked at the same direction .
This is a visitor from another painting ,
It &apos;s like they &apos;re going to start talking .
By the way , I never understand the conflict between _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
because all of the painting is from abstract .
And one day I got a car in the country ,
and said , &quot; That &apos;s a good design . &quot;
Because the purpose of this symbol is to get you to a garage ,
And because most people are not in the garage ,
and thought that it would be _UNK_ ,
Because once you hear the word &quot; _UNK_ &quot; --
It &apos;s a old word that &apos;s not called _UNK_ --
And you would have a child to put your finger in the dam
To prevent the dam falling down and to the Dutch .
So the _UNK_ is more clear because of the use of _UNK_ .
If you think I &apos;m a _UNK_ now ,
You can try to _UNK_ other words like Indians .
Of course , Swiss , but you know how much money you spend .
I &apos;m going to take you through the real process of creating _UNK_ .
I did a lot of work for my _UNK_ Institute ,
a very good guy called the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
often give you a little script and say , &quot; What &apos;s going on with it . &quot;
This is the little script -- it &apos;s the same thing for fashion .
Don &apos;t be the first person to try to get a new one .
and not to be the last man to abandon . &quot;
The first piece I did was I didn &apos;t have any creative ,
I can see that I just write it up to _UNK_ words ,
And at the same time , I did some design ,
I expected , as people often hope , what can happen to create .
I printed a few words on the color paper .
and put them on a ugly _UNK_ board
I think something must come out of it ,
For example , the first _UNK_ of the old Roman _UNK_
But I &apos;m going to have some confusion ,
And then I thought it should be re - _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to record what I know about it ,
And you can see the beginning of some ideas ,
because you find the word &quot; _UNK_ &quot; out of the _UNK_ ,
There is a kind of relationship between _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
The _UNK_ came out of the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
And I have another version of the interesting version ,
It will be able to _UNK_ all the _UNK_ together to form your head .
And the W is obviously &quot; _UNK_ , &quot; N is _UNK_ .
And there &apos;s not a lot of information about it .
Now I went back to a point which seems unable to return .
So I did something that was really shame ,
And I found two other pictures of creation ,
And what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , change this copy .
to make it _UNK_ , to the visual art institute ,
with a lot of other _UNK_ that are different .
For example , it is against the _UNK_ of _UNK_ ,
is to be directly seen and understanding , rather than _UNK_ .
And I remember listening to the image art
&quot; If you have to explain it , it doesn &apos;t have any effect . &quot;
And one day I woke up and said , &quot; If that &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
So in the _UNK_ , I &apos;m going to explain
It is better to choose the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
I &apos;m talking to my audience about my own idea , right ?
This is what you never want to do .
&quot; Maybe the text can be constructed but there is no other side .
If you want to be careful , you don &apos;t catch a fashion .
Is it a fashion for the _UNK_ itself ?
you can suggest that the _UNK_ goes through the _UNK_ ,
So I &apos;m going to show you a picture --
You should remember the old creation that I abandoned ?
and I think it &apos;s not bad , it &apos;s _UNK_ --
Maybe what you want to say is _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
that are going to affect each other . &quot;
And then it &apos;s more self - _UNK_ -- &quot; I &apos;m not just the head simple ?
This is a very simple one , or a very profound simple one ?
In fact , I noticed that fear of _UNK_ driving me like any _UNK_ .
Do you think this is going to attract a student to school ?
Well , I think there are two new things here -- two new things .
One is -- in front of the _UNK_ audience ,
It doesn &apos;t mean that what I &apos;m doing is full of confidence .
As you know , you have to have a direction to face ,
If you don &apos;t believe what you do , who will believe ?
Another one is that it gives you two solutions ,
What if you don &apos;t like that , what about that small one ?
And I asked a question -- must it be squares ?
just because of the _UNK_ in the computer .
And sometimes , as though the back is bigger than the front ,
If you sit here long enough , it will leave the page in the audience .
And the edges of it are determined by _UNK_ ,
but the shape of the bottle like that .
This is not a _UNK_ for the _UNK_ Institute .
There are 10 artists who are invited to do this ,
This is one of the great _UNK_ of competition ,
And the idea is -- this is a good idea --
_UNK_ a 10 _UNK_ in the subway in the whole city ,
so that every time you go into the subway ,
There is a different understanding of what art is .
But I was completely _UNK_ on the idea of art .
But then I gave up and thought , &quot; Everything is art . &quot;
I found the word &quot; _UNK_ &quot; in the word &quot; _UNK_ , &quot;
But again it became a _UNK_ of my _UNK_ .
I want to explain the _UNK_ with some literature ,
I thought I could use this era &apos;s visual _UNK_ , _UNK_ people ,
to express art with _UNK_ , _UNK_ and historic thought .
I &apos;m sure that in the age of computer control ,
Some of them are not what you &apos;re going to do , but the concept of your creation .
The shadow of the _UNK_ _UNK_ the center of the _UNK_ .
And when this _UNK_ is hidden in the word &quot; _UNK_ &quot;
The hat on the _UNK_ suggests that art might be defined .
a kind of thing itself , the value of things , the shadow of things .
to see what degree you can still identify the words .
But then I _UNK_ the parts of the _UNK_ ,
And of course , they are _UNK_ and they have _UNK_ .
But what you &apos;re going to read is that --
all of the ideas that are _UNK_ in this period
And I think everybody can do that for me .
What do you want if you give you three wishes ?
Think about this problem , except to let us know what we want .
thinking about this problem , except for being able to benefit
to do something that might make life different .
And it was the source of all my inspiration .
And when I was in Canada , I was _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ of snow in the ice _UNK_ .
So I had a lot of opportunity to do this with him .
I might never get a clue how much I learned from this experience
In this world , we are all just a _UNK_ .
to see the nature of nature in front of us .
the _UNK_ Coast and the forest of the people .
You can &apos;t see the old people before you see them .
to read the world over and over again .
What I &apos;m doing now is the feeling of the time .
I think I should do it , and I can do it .
So , in a spring , I walked on my journey
And these are the scene of the _UNK_
At the same time , the work is not bad for a artist &apos;s career .
I &apos;ve always been able to do my work for a long time .
as a wall wall or something like this .
So I started thinking , if I should replace my own _UNK_ ,
And when I was lost in Pennsylvania ,
And when I was lost in Pennsylvania ,
I was in a _UNK_ , and I thought it could go back to the highway
And it turns out to be a town called Frank _UNK_ ,
And here was a mining site , when I got out of it ,
I saw a scene that had never seen before .
And in this act , I started to move
that I could find in my eyes
And it became the starting point of my work
and became the theme that I kept on .
to look at the footprint of the big industry .
is a very large theme of the subject .
And if I really live in my life ,
And I want to borrow this opportunity
that the _UNK_ of the world is _UNK_
And basically , every picture you see is that
is going to be able to get a license
And if it &apos;s not the help of them ,
I may never be able to take these works .
As I did , I didn &apos;t want to say anything about these companies .
I can feel the importance of their lives
And it was because of this , I ended up with them .
I don &apos;t want to complain about what they &apos;re doing .
So I started thinking that humans have gone a lot of times
the Stone Age , the hardware Age , the bronze era ,
And even though the mark of these times is still saved ,
And this is a very horrible thing .
And we suddenly _UNK_ and thought about it .
to feel like I &apos;m going to feel like this .
but not to get rid of these images .
I &apos;m not going to call God , what &apos;s going to do ? &quot;
And it was _UNK_ , &quot; It looked like this .
But it &apos;s a cruel beauty to get people to enjoy it . &quot;
It &apos;s not moral to think of such a picture .
I hope people don &apos;t appreciate these things , but think and experience
Maybe you can understand how I feel when I face these scenes .
It &apos;s only a house that has a car to live in .
When did I start to be fascinated by this kind of life ?
And I had to admit that this was shame .
And I tried to make me transition through my own work .
Look at this picture , this is a _UNK_ .
This is the biggest one . It &apos;s about _UNK_ million old tires .
And here is Mr. _UNK_ , close to _UNK_
It was only a half hours away from my home , but four years ago ,
I decided to look at some kind of scene
And if it had been just focused on nature ,
Now it &apos;s a _UNK_ for our behavior to convey to nature .
It was a good start for me , a _UNK_ .
I &apos;m going to take these pieces of waste
as a practice of sustainable development in humans .
there &apos;s only one of the things that we live in .
that humans are going to continue to survive .
And the _UNK_ , the rest of the subject ,
are expected to protect us from the natural world .
But at the same time , in the meantime ,
And after a while in North American America ,
I started looking at the world , and I looked at it ,
And after all , I heard a radio show ,
Because of the claim from this event ,
all of these extra _UNK_ that are _UNK_
And I thought , &quot; Oh my God , that &apos;s too _UNK_ . &quot;
A large _UNK_ is _UNK_ by a little bit of artificial _UNK_ .
So I want to go to India and look at it .
But because of the local green organization , I was rejected by India .
So I &apos;m going to change my destination to Bangladesh .
This is my first contact with the third world .
_UNK_ people , living in the same place as _UNK_ .
This is one of the biggest _UNK_ in California .
and see the scene of this kind of thing
the entire world that we live in ,
And so I wanted to use oil as a foundation
This is what I &apos;m going to do in the next three years .
I think all of us , whatever it is ,
are connected to oil , directly or indirect ,
So let &apos;s see some of the pictures in China
I began to film China four years ago .
I mean , China is an old _UNK_ problem .
is that there &apos;s a huge impact on the planet
General cars are local _UNK_ industries , my father is working for it .
And so I was very familiar with it .
And that &apos;s the same thing that I &apos;ve done .
But the same industry , in the Chinese scale , is completely different .
And what you see here is the dam
This is the biggest dam in humans , larger than the second .
Most of the world engineers think that this is impossible to do it .
In fact , when this project was done in a year and a half ago ,
people can actually detect the earthquake of the _UNK_ .
And this is a great project that brought another big project
_UNK_ all the residents of the city in _UNK_
and _UNK_ the city to go to the _UNK_ .
This is one of the cities moving forward . It &apos;s just before migration .
This is about 10 weeks later , basically by artificial _UNK_ .
I &apos;m impression that there are eleven buildings used in the _UNK_ process
And the rest of it is done , it &apos;s only 10 weeks
is that people who live in this room
and they put their own cities in a _UNK_ .
Every stone they can get a certain payment .
And this is another picture of some of these pictures .
I spent three times on my journey ,
It looks like it &apos;s just bombing , it &apos;s not .
This is a land that is completely dependent on will .
This is a powerful force that allows them to _UNK_ .
and it &apos;s going to take a lot of changes
But it might be a good thing to do
North American America has not been built for 20 years .
because nobody wants to put this fire in the backyard
But China can say , &quot; No , we &apos;re going to build a building in 10 years . &quot;
So the coal mine is a big problem .
And the _UNK_ project leads to another problem
It &apos;s a lot of land that you can see on the left side , always _UNK_ .
Many of the most _UNK_ fields are so buried underwater .
This is one of the biggest immigrant cities in the suburbs .
In the _UNK_ process , I &apos;m sorry to find out
In my opinion , these _UNK_ are not completely _UNK_ .
that we call the concept of urban planning
There &apos;s no park here , there &apos;s no green area .
There &apos;s only a thick _UNK_ up on the hill .
They had the opportunity to build a beautiful city
Here &apos;s a _UNK_ , and it says , &quot; _UNK_ _UNK_ and _UNK_ . &quot;
to create the idea of science and civilization ,
But what makes me feel scared is that
that are hidden behind the _UNK_ cultures ,
They look like they don &apos;t have a _UNK_ ,
and we &apos;re going to live in a single way .
And when you look at the _UNK_ ,
how they _UNK_ their old _UNK_ life ,
to the _UNK_ of the city culture of the West .
you will have a sense of what it is .
This picture is one of the biggest squares in _UNK_ .
And here &apos;s a country full of _UNK_ in town .
about 25 million people all over the world
And in the future 10 to 15 years ,
They _UNK_ the city or production center of Shanghai .
usually from local , or most of them are home enterprises .
The factory uses pink , which is a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is here from every country in the country .
This is one of the biggest _UNK_ in Shenzhen , _UNK_ .
There are two companies in the same place .
And then the next round of the workmen came to dinner .
The area will soon be _UNK_ by the ground .
In five years , the new _UNK_ building will come from here
If it &apos;s five years ago , this is not possible .
They &apos;re being _UNK_ by a very _UNK_ .
They would never give up their home without enough benefit .
Only when their requirements were met , they would compromise .
and the households that are _UNK_ than they are .
They all got a bigger one , a bigger one .
that have been there for hundreds of years ,
And the same story happened in the whole city of Shanghai .
This is the _UNK_ of the Shanghai _UNK_ .
But they didn &apos;t find a reasonable way
This is my wish , and I went over and over again .
I want to tell them that the house can build better .
It &apos;s not like the style of the _UNK_ .
There &apos;s no _UNK_ , if it &apos;s a big photograph ,
And you can see that the electrons in the future
And you can judge their careers , a group of _UNK_
A city full of charm and a city of high speed .
to become the first economic and manufacturing base
The amount of the population is growing to 100 million dollars today .
the scale of immigrants , the speed of development , only from this picture ,
And this is the total number of _UNK_ .
These cars will be _UNK_ , Shanghai , Shenzhen and Shenzhen .
It &apos;s just a taxi car that &apos;s just a taxi .
This is a city that is _UNK_ in high speed .
and you know , you know , 30 buildings ,
And at the same time , the _UNK_ _UNK_
and wait for a walk in the room
But what I want to point out in this picture is not that .
And when I look at these buildings ,
And I think there must be someone here
And for this big community , it &apos;s a community
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be more efficient every home .
you will find that the _UNK_ is _UNK_
so high city development can only be described
And in the future of this photograph ,
And there &apos;s a little site that &apos;s not developed yet .
where eight months ago , they were _UNK_ up .
The new _UNK_ building is coming from here
to describe the construction of Shanghai , not _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been going to take pictures recently
This is the coal mine supply base , _UNK_ square kilometers .
And there &apos;s a lot of people here , and I think at least 10 million people
There are five _UNK_ here in the building .
to keep abreast of the needs of Chinese steel
You can see three _UNK_ in this picture
You can notice that every picture here seems to be filled with smoke .
So what you see is a video of a circuit assembly .
always mentioned that they have the _UNK_ technology
In this place , there are more workers on the floor
I asked them to take me to see some of the most efficient workers
I got a dozen minutes ahead of each person ,
And that is what China really has .
but the vast majority of the people in this country
They wanted to work , and they wanted to work .
And there &apos;s a great army of _UNK_ _UNK_
If everyone fails to change their ideas ,
So there &apos;s still a decade to 15 years
and sooner or later , it &apos;s going to _UNK_ the city .
So let &apos;s go back to this picture
I had to collect small _UNK_ to assure the definition of the picture .
So I have to promise that they can stay about 10 seconds .
but they &apos;re actually going to be able to work in a state of work
because they &apos;ve been used to work every day .
So I had to hire a director , and he was _UNK_ .
And unfortunately , this is a picture of the _UNK_ .
This is a picture of _UNK_ _UNK_ , a _UNK_ of oil .
There are 500 million dollars per value of value .
They just have to go back and forth on the line .
And the industrial scene is a very _UNK_ .
So I went back to a factory again .
and I did a lot of these things .
_UNK_ is better at the scale of this kind of scene .
And here is the _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_
There are about five million workers in this room
It &apos;s very difficult to get into a _UNK_ business .
Nike or Nike , as a company like this ,
This is a work scene of China all over China .
And you can see that in these pictures ,
Nike was one of the first companies in China .
And the cost of labor is very expensive .
So they have to choose a cheap labor market
This is a hi - tech cell business , _UNK_ phones .
Maybe there &apos;s a new cell phone company every week
This is a textile processing business in a shirt .
In _UNK_ , one of the biggest _UNK_ in China
And the next picture is a _UNK_ .
The people here are usually eight to eight .
This is the largest plant I &apos;ve ever seen .
for about 20 million people in the world
There are _UNK_ employees here , and the plants are _UNK_ .
These are the pictures I &apos;ve just come back a month ago .
So you &apos;re the first people to see these pictures
I spent nearly a year to get into these places
This is a country that is extremely eager for resources .
So we have a lot of resources here
are collected by the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ China .
and they take them out of the generator ,
that are not necessarily related to California or Silicon Valley .
This is the final end of most computer computers .
About half of the computers in the world are in China ,
But because of their _UNK_ , these things are really going to happen .
They are _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
and then put the pieces out of the board ,
and it &apos;s got the value of metal in it .
but it &apos;s going to produce a lot of toxic gases .
where there are five or ten places around this industry .
you can smell the smell of _UNK_ .
They are mostly families , and the area is not big .
Maybe it &apos;s in the front door , in the backyard , and even in the room ,
Maybe some of you will have this question .
It &apos;s really illegal to do it in China .
But in fact , they can &apos;t stop these acts .
This is a _UNK_ , and I &apos;m very little _UNK_ .
But this is a really _UNK_ to me
and through the Revolution , and now she &apos;s sitting in the courtyard
The road is full of _UNK_ computer _UNK_
This is the largest _UNK_ village of electronic waste .
And that &apos;s what I want to show you .
I &apos;d like to give my wish to my two daughters .
And in all the time I think , they always _UNK_ my mind .
On the right side , the left side is _UNK_ .
And all of these pictures that I did
There &apos;s a big meaning for what we &apos;re going to do .
And all of this is in this moment ,
is going to be a little bit more _UNK_ .
And I want to do what we do
I think we &apos;re not only going to change the world around us .
and it should be positive to change ourselves .
to avoid being wrong in the future .
And although the wrong behavior continues , especially in Asia , it &apos;s getting worse .
And although I know that this is a _UNK_ thing ,
But I think that &apos;s why we need to focus on their development
because they &apos;re going to influence our development at the same time .
And this is what I think , and I wish ,
&quot; Twenty years later , or 15 years later ,
when they start thinking about marriage , family and _UNK_
whether it &apos;s my work , or thinking about it ,
And the question is what I think about .
My first wish : change the world . I want to use my photographs
to get more people to focus on sustainable development .
I think this is not a _UNK_ wish .
I did some investigation before , and I hope my wish
to work on the ground , not to stay in the _UNK_ ,
And although my wish is not yet to achieve
But I &apos;ve found a similar action in the field .
in the middle of the 14 months ,
Their attitude is what I like to do .
They don &apos;t have to go to the old _UNK_ of the environment ,
to make people try to change the way
And this blog is actually showing people
some of the things that make our world better .
including new technologies , new energy saving equipment ,
the new idea , the new strategy of innovation
And what I do is I can do
is to take my work out of it .
Perhaps some of you know , I and the _UNK_ , he &apos;s also TED .
with some _UNK_ , and of course , it &apos;s also _UNK_ .
not the final design results , the images of these _UNK_
_UNK_ , _UNK_ stations , or any other place
And this is a starting point in the beginning .
Most media use a lot of text to add a _UNK_ .
is the dominant image , and it &apos;s very rare .
is to transmit information through a lot of images .
and let people see pictures at the same time .
&quot; _UNK_ , what are these pictures , what is this ? &quot;
and want people to open the website with problems .
And even though _UNK_ is just a blog ,
But I hope he can grow bigger , and I can use it as a blog
because there are lots of people who are _UNK_
I believe that it can make my voice , and it can lead to my influence .
Now , on this website , you know ,
I believe that someday we can make a _UNK_
If you want to make something for this , it &apos;s a great time .
My next wish is to think more about the next generation .
And the wish is , I want to start a creative movement
to encourage kids to develop their own ideas .
And the idea is to be _UNK_ by my _UNK_ .
And in the middle of the storm ,
And when she talked about the _UNK_ of Canada ,
I suddenly thought that four years of _UNK_
Four grade , which is about seven years old ,
They just started to develop , and they just began to understand society .
So for the children in this stage ,
and we teach it to be very important .
I think we can start with the baby .
to get them to know what is sustainable .
and to develop their interest in sustainable development
One way I think is to use the bonus
about _UNK_ to _UNK_ dollars as a bonus .
And the rest of the project was launched by the management Fund .
by _UNK_ the kids to participate in the activity ,
in the same way that I think is
that the activity will eventually be able to vote
a _UNK_ for sustainable development of the university
a best family sustainable proposal for the first time
and the best community to develop projects
And I also wanted to build a prize for my world art ,
And this is a project that is _UNK_ .
If we can attract some of the people
it &apos;s going to make the project become _UNK_ .
to all schools , including the state schools ,
to collect the work and the top of it .
The _UNK_ should give a real project , not some _UNK_ ideas .
Art works can be their ideas , or the process of doing it .
But all of that must fall into the _UNK_ .
to encourage kids to think about this age ,
through the idea that they can continue to develop
I believe their behavior can affect their parents , their families ,
And this is going to be the most active thing
And maybe you can get a _UNK_ of garbage
I don &apos;t want everyone to focus on all kinds of things that are going to happen .
but I hope everyone can understand that .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to do .
Let &apos;s go back to the &quot; World _UNK_ , &quot;
We can collect the art works as propaganda .
This topic allows us to recognize ourselves as a master of the world .
This is my world , not the rest of the world , I should protect her .
And I should do something for her .
I think this is a great opportunity to encourage kids
I think every school should take some money and equipment
and the students are involved in this activity .
And we can do that at the same time .
and _UNK_ my world like this one .
My third wish was to take a film
I &apos;ve been saying to myself that I should take a film like this , which is my wish .
When I first saw _UNK_ , I found this and my work
and what I &apos;ve been doing , there are some _UNK_
And I think that all of the content or the form
It &apos;s all similar to what I did as a photographer .
I &apos;m going to give you a sense of _UNK_ .
And of course , I need someone to come to me
I &apos;ve just been 50 years old , and I have no time to learn
to help me get the skills that are related
It must be interesting to take my work on a _UNK_ road .
So , above all , it &apos;s my three wish .
I want to take two things about the human species
The first phenomenon is that you might think it &apos;s obvious .
that any other species on the planet can &apos;t do that .
And of course , we are also _UNK_ species .
So we liked to point out that we were smart .
You know , I can list the words of Shakespeare or _UNK_
And when you have to think about it ,
But of course , I want to focus on more
The second _UNK_ of the human race
And although we &apos;re really clever , sometimes unique ,
and it was an incredible _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
Don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m not going to point out
But of course , in the last two years ,
We &apos;ve seen a special tool that we use ,
And we also see what we &apos;re doing ,
This should be a very _UNK_ financial market ,
It was raining down at the bottom of us .
But I think these two examples of _UNK_
we might prefer to think that these mistakes
more like a couple of _UNK_ apples ,
Or some mistakes are worth making decisions on blogs .
But in fact , the social scientists think
And when in a certain environment , our _UNK_
but it &apos;s always going to be the same thing ,
And so I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be confused . &quot;
We are as a kind of clever species ,
You know , we are the _UNK_ , why don &apos;t we get the answer ?
In some sense , what is wrong to us ?
After a while , I felt some different possibilities .
The first possibility is that in a sense , it &apos;s not our fault .
that we can &apos;t understand at some point ,
and you can &apos;t deal with the housing _UNK_ ,
And of course , if we &apos;re not in the environment ,
If this , we can easily easily solve it .
But what I &apos;m more worried about is another possibility ,
And that is , maybe not bad environmental problems ,
And what I &apos;m going to do is to be inspired .
I noticed that people will be again and again
And it &apos;s like when we were built ,
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m more worried about ,
and it &apos;s not even more clear how to deal with it .
We may only accept the fact that we can make mistakes ,
So this is the question that my students all care about ,
How do we tell the difference between these two possible ?
But with our system -- that &apos;s what we might _UNK_ .
is that they don &apos;t have any kind of thing ,
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to study them .
This is one of my work . It &apos;s a brown _UNK_ .
And that means that they &apos;ve been able to
In this case , you &apos;ve been a grandmother .
It may be a little bit more likely to be here .
that we can safely say that these guys are really far away
She didn &apos;t actually have the same technology .
You know , she &apos;s clever , lovely little animals , and she belongs to the _UNK_ ,
And she didn &apos;t know what we could do .
If we put the _UNK_ in the same situation ?
She &apos;s not going to learn from that ? And so on .
These are the problems that we want to talk about .
I was looking forward to this experiment a few years ago .
We said , let &apos;s throw some of the problems that we &apos;ve done
The first question is , well , where is it going to start ?
because it &apos;s good for us , but it &apos;s hard for humans .
We will make different mistakes in different areas .
So , where are we going to go from ?
It was the time that the financial crisis started ,
and the news is that the property is recycled ,
Look at them not as bad as we are .
And of course , the second question is _UNK_ ,
A monkey is not a currency . No one has a monkey and abroad .
This is why when you &apos;re in the grocery store or in front of the ATM ,
and you see the monkey behind you -- they don &apos;t do that .
So we &apos;ve got a little bit of trouble here ,
If the monkey doesn &apos;t use the money ,
We &apos;re like , well , a little bit of patience ,
And you see this little thing that I &apos;ve got in my hand
We didn &apos;t have a lot of creative when we started this study ,
We teach _UNK_ to use these currency in _UNK_ .
It doesn &apos;t look like _UNK_ , it &apos;s actually not worth it .
Like our currency system , it uses metal to do it .
like all the foreign currency you travel after your trip ,
There is no use for these things .
And when we first put these _UNK_ together ,
They come up and look at these _UNK_ .
to change food with people in the lab .
You can see one monkey , _UNK_ , is doing this .
A graph to B is a little bit curious ,
_UNK_ soon realized that the human wanted this _UNK_ .
It &apos;s not just the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ,
Here &apos;s a little clip , and we &apos;re going to see what &apos;s going on .
This is _UNK_ . She &apos;s going to use the _UNK_ food ,
This is _UNK_ , a group of _UNK_ , a big guy .
He also patient wait for the arrival of food .
It &apos;s very good to be able to show very few training .
We just let them choose what they want .
The question is : What is the relationship between the currency of human beings ?
Or we just use some strange psychological ways ,
So we thought , if this is really their currency , it &apos;s like we use it ,
What kind of natural response can the _UNK_ do ?
is that they start doing something like human beings .
They &apos;re going to start looking at the price ,
and remember the use of these monkeys .
We let monkey live in a kind of _UNK_ _UNK_ ,
to a transparent cage that can enter the market .
This market is a lot more interesting in the human market ,
Because , when monkey went into this market ,
people will give them a wallet full of _UNK_ ,
In _UNK_ , _UNK_ will do the same thing ,
Who sells what price is , who is more reliable and so on .
And you can see that these two _UNK_
to take a little yellow dish out there ,
A monkey can buy something in the plate with a _UNK_ .
But sometimes a _UNK_ can buy more stuff ,
Let me show you how this monkey works .
This is taken from a monkey perspective , so it &apos;s lower .
She was a bit impatient waiting for the market .
And the market opened , she had two choices : buy one or two grapes .
She could give us our financial _UNK_ to class .
Most monkey will do business with the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Most monkeys will deal with a good deal of food .
At first , we found monkey going to focus on this thing .
The most amazing thing is that when we start working with economists ,
And when you measure the data of a monkey ,
so that in a very _UNK_ way ,
You can &apos;t tell these data results are human or monkey .
The other question is that monkeys don &apos;t _UNK_ the system like us ?
And we also looked at some of the phenomena .
First of all , we didn &apos;t find it in the monkey market .
The monkey came to the market and would spend all the money ,
The monkey didn &apos;t take any chance to steal the _UNK_ ,
These are all the behaviors that we don &apos;t think about
_UNK_ made something like the _UNK_ of human beings ?
But it may be a few years ago .
You want to know how people make mistakes ,
So I &apos;m going to give you a little experiment ,
Please answer your financial intuition with your financial _UNK_ .
A ten - _UNK_ bill became a _UNK_ of $ _UNK_ .
It takes a little time to think what you &apos;re going to do with this money .
It &apos;s your money . You can buy anything you want .
It sounds like _UNK_ ? But another chance you can get more than $ _UNK_ .
The first option : the risk is going to take more ,
I tried to figure out the results of the choice .
If the _UNK_ is a positive one , you can take two hundred dollars .
There &apos;s a chance to get more , but it &apos;s going to take risks .
And the other option : let you take the exact amount of money .
You can put this money into a wallet or spend it right away .
These people say , I &apos;m sure I can get 1500 dollars , why do you want to risk ?
It seems to be a good choice , I choose it .
Now , imagine , I &apos;m going to give you two million dollars ,
You just want to buy more items than doubled .
Think of the money in the wallet &apos;s sense .
Now , the choice is over and over again ,
because you &apos;re going to decide the way to lose money ,
_UNK_ the coin , if it &apos;s positive , you lose $ _UNK_ .
If it &apos;s a tail , you don &apos;t use a _UNK_ , it &apos;s worth two hundred dollars .
Or you can &apos;t risk , you can take your wallet out ,
and then give me five bills for me .
I see a lot of people _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
And maybe you have the same _UNK_ answer ,
It &apos;s also the same choice of 2 different situations ,
to get 1,000 or 2,000 dollars to 50 percent ,
And people are _UNK_ about the risk of risk ,
Well , the answer came from this question
The two _UNK_ on our psychology are _UNK_ .
One is that we don &apos;t have enough time to calculate absolute value .
You should take a long time to think about it ,
In contrast , if the options are added to the relative value ,
and the option is , &quot; get more &quot; or less . &quot;
In other words , we &apos;re going to hate any loss .
We will be very _UNK_ to lose any money .
It &apos;s just in the second situation , in the second situation ,
because you don &apos;t want to let any chance to lose zero .
And that &apos;s what we think about risk --
and the negative behavior of humans is also exposed .
and to what the stock investors would have dropped ,
And that &apos;s what investment in the _UNK_ don &apos;t want to sell the house ,
because they don &apos;t want the house to sell it .
If we designed the same problem in the monkey market ,
So we let monkeys choose two _UNK_ ,
One is a safe _UNK_ , he &apos;s going to take the same thing ;
we have the options that we have dividends --
like the first situation that was just --
They actually feel that they &apos;ll get more grapes .
We will introduce two new _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
The one on the left is starting to take a _UNK_ ,
The one on the left is the safety dividend .
At the end , he will _UNK_ a monkey a grapes .
The right is to provide risk dividends .
Sometimes monkey _UNK_ to any dividend , so he won &apos;t have any grapes .
This is exactly the same thing to you .
Now , monkey is going to choose a safe dividend deal ,
is that the same person that deals with every deal ;
although it &apos;s going to take risks , it &apos;s possible to take any dividends ,
You might think it might be because _UNK_ don &apos;t like adventure .
So let &apos;s look at the behavior of monkey dealing with loss .
So we did the second version of this .
So they started to take out more grapes .
starting to take out three _UNK_ : this is the best thing to see .
But they found that these two guys were going to give less than expected .
On the left , he offers a fixed _UNK_ .
Every time he would set up a monkey _UNK_ ,
The one on the right has the risk of risk .
And sometimes one is not going to be low , totally _UNK_ ,
which is just to give the monkey _UNK_ .
or do risk trading , take one or three grains .
And the best thing to focus on is that when _UNK_ face this choice ,
They show the same behavior as human beings .
And this is a really incredible thing ,
And there &apos;s a very different behavior in dealing with loss and _UNK_ .
We &apos;re going to do it first . First of all ,
And we gave a monkey a financial currency ,
They will make things that are as smart as humans ,
and it &apos;s going to be as good as human beings ,
and they &apos;re also going to be as irrational as human beings .
I &apos;d like to give you the first conclusion
If you only hear the beginning part , you might think --
I really should hire a _UNK_ as my financial _UNK_ .
The guy &apos;s cute is more than the one in the house .
But you can &apos;t do that because of these monkeys
This is a little sorry . I &apos;m going to say ,
Of course , those of you who laugh at the same thing as investment guests .
The answer to this question is already proven to you .
And we want to understand these mistakes ? _UNK_ ,
in some of the hopes that it &apos;s like
But we have learned that these two _UNK_ have deeply influenced us .
In fact , these _UNK_ are going to affect us ,
And the one on the right side of this graph ,
Perhaps the source of a _UNK_ is a long time ago .
If we believe that these findings of monkeys
It has been a long time to influence us .
How much do we know about these kinds of _UNK_ ?
One of the things we know is that we can &apos;t change it .
You can &apos;t afford it to be full of _UNK_ , &quot; I can &apos;t eat it . &quot;
we &apos;re going to pursue ourselves as a good thing .
So I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to have
You &apos;ll be silly to see the shares fall in line ,
And you &apos;re not going to notice the truth of things ,
It sounds bad news , which is no good news ?
I &apos;m here to have some good news to you .
as I said at the beginning of today ,
are going to be smart enough to be .
We &apos;re very good at solving the _UNK_ of our nature --
like I &apos;m going to take a plane here ,
I don &apos;t need my hand to fly around the wings .
I can look at you with a contact lens ,
I don &apos;t need to rely on my big eyes .
but we have to know where our limits are ,
And it &apos;s like the _UNK_ said , &quot; Well , you know ,
I hope you all know where your limits are ,
and develop the tools to understand the human limit .
and want to lead the potential of human beings ,
This is probably the only way to do it .
You might find that this is really interesting .
And there &apos;s a lot of things in life .
I want to start with the beginning of the day
How do you look at what &apos;s around you ?
If I &apos;m doing something , it &apos;s all in my life .
And of course , if it &apos;s bad , that &apos;s what you do .
And after 20 years of working in the _UNK_ industry ,
That &apos;s when we &apos;re adults , it doesn &apos;t have to be abandoned .
Let me explain the reason why this is
a million pounds sound like a lot of things .
But this is just every year in the world .
and the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ --
in the world that is _UNK_ --
This is one of the fastest kinds of junk
If you don &apos;t have anything else to do , like cars ,
And the reason we see that there &apos;s a lot of value
that can _UNK_ the raw material for these things .
I &apos;m going to talk about how to make these completely _UNK_ ,
And as the population and the human desire ,
And of course , there &apos;s a toy and tool
We use tools and toys every day .
It &apos;s basically all kinds of plastic and metal materials .
The good news is that we &apos;re starting to restore these _UNK_
especially in the European world that we &apos;re in ,
If you can use it , it &apos;s metal .
I &apos;m here to show you a steel show
is going to be recycled at the same time .
Most people now think that plastic is an abandoned material
But in fact , plastic is much better than steel .
So why this is so large and valuable material
So it &apos;s very easy for the human machine
And the plastic is in a very small scale .
metal can be _UNK_ by humans so easily .
Many raw materials are from the developed world --
And unfortunately , most of the people from the United States
We don &apos;t have any kind of _UNK_ policy in Europe --
One day , just one dollar , to _UNK_ garbage ,
and they can come in , and most of them are metals --
and left most of the things that they can &apos;t recycle .
or they burn the plastic and get the metal ,
And those other ways are clearly not able to recycle plastic --
This is a picture I stand on the roof .
One of the biggest _UNK_ in the world , in India ,
The roof is like this little shop like this .
and people are very hard to do these kinds of plastic categories .
And sometimes they take the &quot; burning and _UNK_ &quot; technology .
is that they make plastic and smell it .
These technologies are not going to work for _UNK_ .
So how do we deal with these kinds of aviation materials
at least what we call this plastics , at least ?
I believe that they are really big wealth .
So , about 20 years ago , I started working in the garage
a friend of mining , a friend of plastic
We began to visit the _UNK_ laboratory around the world .
In the important material , the final use of _UNK_
And we finally found a way of _UNK_
to _UNK_ the molecules and then _UNK_ it in a special way .
and create a great plastic product that we enjoy every day .
We think there &apos;s a more sustainable way to produce plastic
_UNK_ is a very good experiment material .
And as I hope , you can see it from photographs
And because we &apos;re not going to turn the plastic into molecules
What we use is to extract the raw material
I don &apos;t know how many other projects in the world today
can be compared with traditional ways of production
It &apos;s more than a million dollars a year .
a kind of plastic plant that was used
Our factory can make all kinds of plastic products .
And they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
I want to share with you a little bit of what we do .
At the beginning , it can _UNK_ metal into small units .
and it &apos;s called _UNK_ stuff -- the waste that &apos;s produced --
like they miss metal , _UNK_ , foam plastic , rubber ,
And this is the first part of our process , and it looks like _UNK_ .
It looks like a _UNK_ plant in this point .
At the end of the process , we &apos;re going to make plastic mixed .
This is the steps that we take in all the processes .
and the hardest job , the beginning of the process
We _UNK_ the plastic to the size of the _UNK_ .
And then the final process of the process
We then _UNK_ the color of the color .
and put this material into a _UNK_ machine .
This is the currency in the plastic industry .
And at the same time , you can make it new .
and then _UNK_ your desk for the new one .
So I hope I &apos;ve changed all of you
And the point is that at least part of the things
I hope you don &apos;t think of yourself as a consumer --
And that &apos;s the tag that I &apos;ve lost my life --
to make ourselves a form of using resources .
a little bit of changes in the last child &apos;s law .
If you come in , you &apos;ll see us at night ,
Ten people _UNK_ a table , but not everyone in the seat .
And when I was ready for dinner ,
Sometimes she said she didn &apos;t know who was , where she was .
And we would say , &quot; _UNK_ a dish , he put him in the oven .
And then we pray , and then we eat it .
when anyone has a big deal of meaning ,
like when Mother was elected to the parent teacher ,
Or when his dad got a job in our university .
or anyone who wins the _UNK_ game ,
The traditional ceremony of our family is that after announcing it ,
We have to take five to 10 minutes to conclude that person ,
is that _UNK_ really _UNK_ the praise of the _UNK_ ,
Similarly , we must report to our family guests .
My job is , at least _UNK_ to visit _UNK_
So we need to go through and see if they don &apos;t need anything .
Mom said , &quot; It &apos;s a family , it &apos;s about to share and share , and take care of others .
Of course , there will be a reward at once .
And she said , &quot; If they ask you how much money you spend ,
If they insist on you , &quot; No matter how you give a little bit of &quot;
This is the nature of our dining table .
In fact , she showed that if we did that ,
not only are we going to have _UNK_ members
And she said , &quot; God will smile , and when God smile ,
So , on the dining table , I learned a lot about compassion .
So , I &apos;ve been thinking about eternal mom
And if we insist on _UNK_ and sharing ,
We are convinced that this world is fair and peace .
Now , that dining table is not always wonderful .
I &apos;m going to explain why we can &apos;t do it .
It was Christmas , in a morning of our house ,
We have special _UNK_ where we get to the piano ,
and we _UNK_ . It &apos;s a very close moment .
In fact , you can get a gift and prepare _UNK_ ,
And even if you don &apos;t have to bath or get dressed ,
because one of his colleagues had no place to go .
Then his dad took his colleagues to celebrate family _UNK_ .
We think that he must be insane .
This is what we can do with ourselves ,
He wore a suit and tie when we were still wearing _UNK_ .
Just as long as it is Christmas , there is no other time to go .
&quot; Do you know ? If you really understand the true meaning of _UNK_ ,
_UNK_ is the moment you really extend your love .
_UNK_ is the pleasure of creating space in a _UNK_ family . &quot;
But in _UNK_ , compassion is not a metaphor for debate ,
It &apos;s a kind of emotion that we have to do with it .
as the chief of Seattle said , &quot; We &apos;re not in the _UNK_ of life .
So , no matter what we do , we &apos;re doing it for ourselves . &quot;
So , I told you that I was looking at the world .
I looked at the picture , and some people said , &quot; Look , that &apos;s compassion . &quot;
a _UNK_ , some of the cereal in the corner .
But you &apos;ve got to go to something else
And I &apos;ve seen it all over the years .
with _UNK_ and _UNK_ , Tim Young and _UNK_ ,
Maybe it &apos;s a line of _UNK_ and other _UNK_ ,
Even if there were no _UNK_ and religion , for a common event ,
to be a brother and a sister .
to change the unity of our _UNK_ .
Now , there &apos;s another photograph . I really like this picture .
Bob Kennedy brought a _UNK_ from the _UNK_ wave .
&quot; It will become so _UNK_ that you can &apos;t go . &quot;
And Bob came up and told people ,
Some people may not have heard of Martin _UNK_ . _UNK_ was _UNK_ ,
And I think you &apos;re going to have the opportunity
He said , &quot; I want you to know , I understand your feelings .
because my loved ones were taken away .
And he said , &quot; I want you to do what I do ,
I allowed my anger , _UNK_ , my sad _UNK_ ,
And I decided to go to a new world ,
This is a picture . _UNK_ ? I think I see it .
I saw it in my _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
He invited the beliefs of all over the world .
And then they all use their own language to understand ,
And that &apos;s another version of the Golden Rule .
&quot; How do you treat others , how do you treat yourself ,
who are dressed in the Dalai Lama or national clothing .
And we &apos;re connected , we have to do everything like this .
to treat you as much as you can .
And there &apos;s a picture that I &apos;m thinking about _UNK_ .
And that night , when the public service was in the _UNK_ Church ,
We went on to the station in our city .
&quot; That &apos;s &quot; he said , &quot; One of the most closely connected moments in history . &quot;
But you invite all the traditional representatives to join ,
and tell us what we &apos;re going to do when we &apos;re insult ,
And then they would use their own tradition
The strength of the treatment united with one another .
OK , now I find compassion as a second nature ,
Now , as a _UNK_ , my job is _UNK_ and _UNK_ ,
Or , like the priest in _UNK_ told people ,
So , the real question is , how do you say compassion ?
In my tradition , we &apos;re going to send a gift for other traditions ,
Everybody in the world knows the story of _UNK_ .
A lot of people think that the _UNK_ should be charity ,
But for those who really work or even understand ,
you &apos;ll see a problem slowly coming up ,
You have to love yourself as your master God ,
And people asked , &quot; Well , what do you mean , neighbor ? &quot;
And then he told a man to answer this question ,
and their _UNK_ were to come together to another path ,
And then I said , &quot; This is just starting to work ,
If he had to help , you had to make sure
No matter what he needs , wait for me , I &apos;ll give you the money . &quot;
And this is a challenge for me to be
A _UNK_ consciousness is becoming more and more _UNK_ .
A great _UNK_ is not just a simple , straightforward ,
but a series of sustainable concern -- as I say ,
In the hotel one can continue to care and care .
I think there might be a time in the Bible
and the commitment to what you have to do ,
All the children of God need to be taken care of ,
So when the eternal mother _UNK_ , &quot; _UNK_ about health ,
Are all children in ? &quot; And then we can answer it .
How happy a man to prove the truth of compassion .
And the prisoners , the old man , the children ,
Even the adoption and care of the _UNK_ ,
As a _UNK_ is to care about the needs of these individuals .
But now , as a big _UNK_ , I &apos;m _UNK_ .
And as a good American , for me ,
It &apos;s not a simple _UNK_ that I care about personal behavior ,
I believe that everything we do in the streets of Brad
You have to do something on the dining table and the _UNK_ ritual
So , let me show you the idea of compassion ,
And why do I think compassion is so important
We will decide to build a new chapter of compassion .
It &apos;s important because it &apos;s a very special moment in history .
And this is what we call in the Bible .
Please let me say again , as a black man , celebrate
The election of Obama is a sign of _UNK_ .
This year is the year of God &apos;s grace ,
And there are so many things that need to be done .
We need to bring healthy , food and education
and respect to God , all the children of God ,
Now , let me tell one more thing to end my speech ,
So I want to end with a song .
to the end of the first _UNK_ .
We are all children when our _UNK_ mother &apos;s table table .
This _UNK_ must be meaningful , not just part of our party ,
but the signs of compassion all over the world .
This is the _UNK_ ? I &apos;m so happy today ?
? I received the God &apos;s _UNK_ to the others ?
? When I look at it , _UNK_ is looking at me ?
? Now I &apos;m so happy that you can &apos;t see it ?
? I &apos;m happy . Look at me , I &apos;m happy . Can you see ?
? sharing me joy and make the heaven happy ?
? I &apos;m very happy , and I &apos;m happy ?
? Let me share a lovely smile for you ?
My name is the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
I &apos;ve been giving a story to people for a long time .
It was a hard journey , and I went around and said ,
is to express the feelings of my heart ,
I &apos;m going to call myself a _UNK_ child .
is because the woman in my village
and her ideas about changing the society .
He wanted to create a change , but nobody was listening to his voice .
And the other thing is that my dream
&quot; Don &apos;t give up and continue to advance . &quot;
And sometimes I think about it , I don &apos;t continue to do it again .
because I don &apos;t know the way to go .
I was born in a _UNK_ time .
And what was important to me was that
I saw my aunt was raped by five years old .
that are _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
So I told myself that I was fighting children
and it was deeply printed in my mind .
When I went to camp , I went to school
training is tough , but it &apos;s a power .
They are the purpose of _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
So , understanding the truth that I offer a choice
Is it going to continue hatred ? Or do you give up hatred ?
I made a film called &quot; The _UNK_ Children . &quot;
And then I &apos;m going to change another dimension
That time , we don &apos;t eat food , we eat meat with friends .
I thought it was all _UNK_ by my friends .
When I was really _UNK_ , I couldn &apos;t get rid of it .
I know it &apos;s rude , but I really need food .
And a year later , with _UNK_ , I spent my life in _UNK_
In the _UNK_ , I &apos;m not going to go down
But in this new battle , I &apos;m not lonely .
and don &apos;t wait for it , don &apos;t stop it .
And sometimes , for the right thing , I had to go to crime
and on television , we see your belly .
The music I used to hear was _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
So many people die , I don &apos;t even want to tears for them .
Why is the other kids going to school
I know it &apos;s shame . But who should be blamed ?
This is my story , my life reader reader ,
and supported me , and it was my music .
the music itself is my charity in my own life .
I _UNK_ into a child and dance with music .
If you fall in love with a frog , you &apos;re in love with a frog .
But I didn &apos;t hate their music for anything .
And it was amazing that someday , one day ,
I was dancing with the rhythm of music , and I was almost _UNK_ .
Now , I &apos;m a _UNK_ , I know the power of music
And the project that I &apos;m going to talk about
We want to build a school in _UNK_
It was because I had a meal a day .
Now I went to the West , and I let myself eat a meal .
because that means that we raise enough money to build school
I thought I could raise money in a month .
And I said , &quot; No goal is not to abandon . &quot;
the lowest _UNK_ for 20 cents for 20 cents .
because I understand that this is a big significance in my village .
My country became a very weak country .
They only learned that food from the U.N.
If only for charity , you will be a whole generation of people .
Africa has rain and fertile land . People can grow crops .
And they &apos;re going to die right now ,
and other kids that we think are worth supporting .
I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to put this into practice . &quot;
is going to do this with the friends of common _UNK_ and beliefs .
We were singing the _UNK_ for a British _UNK_ .
And so , for her , I had the opportunity to come here .
is to tell you that Emma has made a lot of changes
And she came to my country in the world
It &apos;s only that they could have a complex country like this .
I hope you can play with me at this point , to celebrate Emma .
? If Emma doesn &apos;t have any _UNK_ , who would I be ?
? You might see my _UNK_ on TV ?
? See the bugs in my eyes , see my big brain ?
? In Africa , _UNK_ is a wild nature ?
? Is he taking the angels to me ?
? I &apos;m living in the world for a reason ?
? Because I &apos;m more aware of life than other people ?
? I &apos;m going to be _UNK_ up now ?
? I want to cross the hill ?
? I &apos;m not a angels , but I want to be a angels ?
? If I can , I want to be Emma _UNK_ ?
? I might be because of hunger or other terrorist diseases ?
? I grew up , but I didn &apos;t have the opportunity to go to school ?
? I know a lot of Emma in the world ?
? They &apos;re looking for life , hoping to save more children ?
? I remember when I was a kid ?
? I &apos;m not going to read or write ?
? Now I grew up and accepted education ?
? How am I ready for the coming day ?
? I want the world to peace ?
? The world could be able to _UNK_ children in _UNK_ ?
? Or not wait for the police to tidy up the _UNK_ ?
? _UNK_ the champagne , _UNK_ the people ?
? I &apos;m going to be a _UNK_ in the _UNK_ of Africa ?
? Is the friend behind the back of the friends ?
? I might have died in hunger ?
? I &apos;m not going to be able to accept education ?
