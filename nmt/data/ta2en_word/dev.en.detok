Female infanticide: Post Mortem reveals rice grains in the guts: suffocation by milk: confession by the arrested mother
Salem, Oct. 15- Female Infanticide is widely prevalent in Dharmapuri and Salem districts. The modus operandi varies from case to case and the parents are driven by the desire to have only male heirs.
Feeding sap of poisonous plants * Swirling the cradle at great speed * Covering the infant with a
drenched blanket * Letting the fan at high speed suffocate the infant * Feeding rice husks to choke the infant
are some of the methods employed to commit this crime
For the First Time.....
Generally it is believed that one of the above methods is usually employed to commit infanticide.
But for the first time rice grains as distinct from husks have been used to choke an infant to death.
Details relating to this as follows: -
Muthannampatti is a village near Thivattipatti in Salem district.
The couple, Venkatachalam and Kalayarasi, of this village already had two girl children namely Revati (aged 9) and Kalpana (aged 3).
The couple were recently expecting their third baby.
The third baby to their professed dismay turned out to be a girl.
They therefore felt tempted to do away with the new born.
They did likewise and buried the baby in their backyard.
The village administrative officer of Nadupatti village, Azhagiya Manavalan tipped off the tehsildar, Jagarajan of this matter.
Following this, the tehsildar and the deputy tehsildar filed a complaint with the Thivatipatti Police.
The Superintendent of Police Rajendran ordered Inspector Muniappan and Head Constables Asaithambi and Meiyazhagan to file a case and conduct investigation.
Hence it was decided to exhume the body.
Following this, the body was exhumed in the presence of the Tehsildar.
The post mortem was conducted on the spot.
Rice grains were retreived from the intestines of the baby.
Mother arrested
In this connection, the parents of the infant have been placed under arrest.
Why was the infant killed by the mother Kalaiarasi?
How was she killed?
The mother has given confessional statement in this regard.
In it, she states:
My husband is a construction worker.
I also do only odd jobs.
We already had two daughters namely Revati and Kalpana.
As a third child we wanted a son.
But unfortunately on the seventh of the last month I gave birth again to a girl.
This left me much distressed.
As it is beyond our means to bring up three girl childern and decided to do away with the third girl child.
On the 10th of last month my husband left for work and
My father Chinnapaiyan fetched milk for the baby
After putting some grains of rice in to the
baby's mouth we poured the milk down the hungry baby's throat.
The grains perhaps got stuck in the throat and
the child started breathing with difficulty.
It cried out aloud.
Nevertheless we hardened our hearts.
In minutes the baby died.
Rama Enacted
I did not wish others to get wind of what had taken place.
Therefore to convince others that it was a natural death I feigned sorrow.
Others did not suspect anything because of my behaviour.
Later
the child was buried in the backyard of my father's house.
We believed that no suspicion would arise.
But later the police have arrested us,
she said.

Nepal riots: Indian students retaliate: block the connecting bridge
Uttaranchal, Dec. 31-
It may be remembered that students of Nepal have been demonstrating against alleged remarks by Hindi film actor Hrithik Roshan.
Now Indian students have prepared to retaliate.
Block the bridge
The bridge on the Mahakali River is the only way by which Nepalis can enter India to look for jobs here. The bridge is in Uttaranchal, which was recently carved out as an independent state from Uttar Pradesh.
The bridge was blocked yesterday to prevent Nepalis from entering India.
The students demonstrated for 2 hours.
Then police intervened and held talks with the students.
After this, the students dispersed.
Then students held a meeting, in which they passed a resolution to ban anti-Indian organizations and
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
Armed forces besiege Navarkuzhi area: army captures LTTE ’ s important bridge: attack ongoing despite ceasefire
Colombo, Dec. 31-
It may be remembered that LTTE, which has been fighting for a separate nation in Sri Lanka, announced a one-month unilateral ceasefire.
But the Sri Lankan army continues its attacks, disregarding the LTTE ’ s ceasefire announcement.
The LTTE had announced that it would observe the ceasefire on account of Christmas.
The army had launched a surprise attack on Jaffna on December 22nd and announced that it killed 200 LTTE cadres.
And it is said to have lost 26 of its personnel.
Attack by armed forces
The Sri Lankan army launched yet another attack on Tigers in the Jaffna peninsula yesterday.
The armed forces made a combined assault in Navarkuzhi early in the morning, at 6 am yesterday.
Kibir and MIG-27 type aircrafts, manufactured in Israel and Russia respectively, heavily bombarded the LTTE ’ s strongholds.
Navy gunboats launched attacks from the Kilaly coast.
The army advanced and launched attacks.
This military action was named Operation Kiniyara-8.
A vital bridge
In this offensive, the Navarkuzhi Bridge, which was under the control of the LTTE, was seized by the army.
The spokesperson of the Sri Lankan army, Sanath Karunaratne, provided this information.
The Tigers were putting up a weak resistance from the start.
Then they retreated from that area.
Then the bridge came under the army ’ s control, Karunaratne said.
He didn ’ t give any information as to how many were killed on both sides.
He said that the LTTE would have lost a lot of cadres.
Out of danger
The LTTE seized the Navarkuzhi Bridge last April.
The bridge is situated 20 km from Jaffna, on an important road connecting Jaffna City
and Savakacheri.
Since the LTTE had captured this bridge, Jaffna City came within its assault range. Now the army has taken possession of this bridge.
The army
feels that it has reduced the danger of Jaffna coming under attack by the LTTE.
It ’ s the second major army offensive after the ceasefire announced by the LTTE.
Tamil political parties
Meanwhile, eleven Tamil political parties have demanded that the Sri Lankan government accept the LTTE ’ s request for a ceasefire.
These parties include the Tamil United Liberation Front, the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), and the Ceylon Labour Union Congress.
They have pleaded that international attention should be drawn to the massacre of Tamils in the Mirusuvil region in the Jaffna district and in Gopalapuram in the Trincomalee district.
Cabinet meeting
Meanwhile, President Chandrika has returned after her 5-week international tour.
She plans to convene a cabinet meeting on January 3rd to decide
if the LTTE ’ s ceasefire could be accepted.
A final decision on the matter is to be made in the cabinet meeting.
It may be remembered that a hotel owned by a German national in Sri Lanka was ransacked.
Police have arrested 2 more people connected to this.
Central government offers financial assistance: Vajpayee orders linking of Kerala ’ s lakes.
Kottayam, Dec. 31- Prime Minister Vajpayee is on a vacation in a small, beautiful village called Kumarakom near Kottyam in Kerala. Thanks to the Prime Minister ’ s visit, Kumarakom has become a tourist spot and is attracting one and all.
Luxury boat ride
Prime Minister Vajpayee went on a luxury boat ride with his family the day before yesterday on the Vembanad backwater lake in Kumarakom.
Vajpayee pleasantly spent three and a half hours in this two-story boathouse.
Wearing dark glasses, he enjoyed watching the wonderful greenery along the entire stretch of the shore and the beauty of the serene lake.
Unforgettable
This is considered the biggest boathouse in the country.
Prime Minister Vajpayee remarked that the day of the boat ride was an unforgettable day for him.
The Secretary of the Department of Tourism and Culture of Kerala, Amitabh Kant, who accompanied the Prime Minister, told this to news people.
Order to inter-link
The official, Amitabh Kant, further said that Prime Minister Vajpayee was very much attracted by the beauty of the Vembanad Lake.
He asked me to start a project to inter-link all of the backwater lakes in Kerala.
The Prime Minister pledged the central government ’ s financial assistance for the project, he said.
The Prime Minister also stressed the need for immediate action to protect and develop Kerala ’ s natural resources.
With due regard to the prime minister ’ s vision, the state government would prepare a detailed project and submit it to the central government, said Amitabh Kant.
Vajpayee is spending the end of the year in Kumarakom.
He is speaking at
a BJP workers ’ meeting today.
He is also meeting some important people, including religious leaders.

Death threat for Vajpayee: Clinton condemns
Washington, Dec. 31- It may be remembered that Lashkar-e-Toiba, a Pakistani terrorist outfit that stormed Red Fort in Delhi said that it would also storm Vajpayee ’ s office.
U.S. President Bill Clinton ’ s Special Secretary, Bruce Riedel, mentioned it yesterday in Washington on behalf of Clinton and said:
Poisonous
This terrorist approach will ruin the progress made in finding a solution to the Kashmir problem.
This is highly condemnable.
The attack on the Delhi Red Fort can have an adverse impact.
In an otherwise good atmosphere, this could sow poisonous seeds,
and upset progress in the peace negotiations.
U.S. support
The Prime Minister has given his full support to finding a solution to the Kashmir issue by extending the ceasefire and expressing his desire to hold peace talks.
The U.S. government expresses its support of Vajpayee ’ s efforts.
The Indian government has allowed All Party Hurriyat Conference leaders to go to Pakistan from Kashmir.
These leaders are happy about the ceasefire that New Delhi has been observing for the last month.
Pakistan ’ s announcement that it would withdraw some of its troops from the LOC has also made the U.S. happy.
We think all of these are the right moves,
he said.
Will the Bangalore function to be attended by Pazha. Nedumaran be banned?
Bangalore, Dec. 31-
It may be remembered that Pazha. Nedumaran rescued Kannada actor Rajkumar, who was kidnapped by Veerappan for a ransom. A function to congratulate Pazha. Nedumaran has been organized in Bangalore.

Inquilab, Seyapragasam, Viduthalai Rajendran, Rajendra Cholan, and Arivumathi will participate in the seminar.
Karnataka is worried.
The seminar, to be presided over by Nedumaran in Bangalore, has become a cause of concern for the Karnataka government.
Karnataka Chief Minister S.M. Krishna is extremely unhappy about this, as there will also be a debate on
the autonomy of states. He is more worried because the issue of state autonomy will be discussed in the seminar.
Open debate
Sridhar, the editor of Agni weekly and one of the organizers of the function, has expressed his opinion on the matter.
He said:
The seminar will have an open debate.
We are going to share our ideas.
Pazha. Nedumaran wants article 370 of the Constitution to be extended to all states.
We will especially analyze this position in the seminar.
We are not worried about anything.
Karnataka Tamils Federation Chief A.P. Shanmugasundaram is attending the function to congratulate Nedumaran,
he said.
Will it be banned?
Nedumaran ’ s seminar is expected to be banned.
Karnataka CM Krishna has hinted about this.
At a function in the Karnataka Film Chamber, he said that demands
for a separate country and a separate language would not be tolerated, and warned that the Karnataka government would not be merely watching it.

Fifteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded Wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on a student bus in the northern town of Haifa, the first bombing in Israel in exactly two months.
Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said.
Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari was killed in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded.
A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestinian security sources said.
Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus bombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victims were youngsters.
The army said two soldiers were also among the dead.
The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential area and Haifa university.
Of the 33 injured still in hospital late Wednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious condition, the radio said.
Israel's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and armoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack.
Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that would risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq.
The Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from the southern West Bank town of Hebron, public radio said, naming him as 20-year-old Mahmoud Hamadan Salim Qawasmi.
Apart from his ID card, also found in the wreckage were the remains of a letter allegedly outlining his plan to carry out a suicide attack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York, it said.
Israeli police were not immediately available for comment, but Palestinian sources in Hebron said Mahmoud Qawasmi was a 21-year-old student with links to the Islamic radical group Hamas.
Israeli forces moved into Hebron's Al-Sheikh district where his family lived and arrested Qawasmi's brother and father after the bombing, they said.
Without claiming responsibility, Hamas and another hardline group, Islamic Jihad, said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody Israeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.
But the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack, saying it would divert international sympathy away from the far higher Palestinian civilian death toll.
"We condemn all attacks against civilians including today's attack in Haifa," said information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as "a pretext for Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February".
It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and came just days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing government in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security.
In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people.
Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly blast a "very grave attack" and said the Jewish state would take "vigorous action against the terrorist organisations".
He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up.
US President George W. Bush condemned the "attack on innocents in Israel," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding that "his message to the terrorists is: Their efforts will not be succcessful.
"He will continue to pursue the path to peace in the Middle East."
EU foreign policy supremo Javier Solana likewise slammed the attack, although he also took a jab at Israel, saying, "There have been too many civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days."
In London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said Tony Blair "condemns absolutely what has happened".
The spokesman added that he "would obviously call on all sides to do what they can to break the cycle of violence, because it is only through engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to see.
"There needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved."
The bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged a bloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a founding member of Hamas, which has spearheaded suicide bombings against the Jewish state.
Hamas vowed to continue its attacks, while the Palestinian Authority accused Israel of trying to disrupt top-level Palestinian meetings to discuss reforms of Arafat's administration.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said international intervention was needed to break the cycle of violence.
Eight people, including a pregnant woman and a 13-year-old child were killed in Monday's Gaza raid, provoking US-led international calls for Israeli restraint.
And on Tuesday, Israeli troops shot dead an elderly Palestinian shepherd outside a Jewish settlement on the edge of Gaza City.
In the West Bank, an eight-year-old Palestinian boy as well as his brother and a sister were wounded late Wednesday by Israeli gunfire in a village north of the town of Ramallah, their elder sister said.
From the St. Pete Times: Some Florida legislators want to give people the right to shoot an attacker in a public place.
A House committee voted Wednesday to allow people to shoot to kill in self-defense if they are attacked "in any other place where he or she has a right to be."
Sponsored by Rep. Dennis Baxley, an Ocala Republican, the bill (HB 249) passed 13-0.
State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause "death or great bodily harm," such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle.
Florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held that a person being attacked has the "duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger, including retreat, prior to using deadly force."
But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public place "has no duty to retreat."
"Law-abiding people should not be told that if they are attacked, they should turn around and run," NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer told lawmakers.
"This bill gives back rights that have been eroded and taken away by a judicial system that at times appears to give preferential treatment to criminals."
Baxley held up a stack of more than 800 e-mails from Floridians who he said have written him to support the bill.
He said 62 House members, a majority, have endorsed his bill, and supporters include Attorney General Charlie Crist and groups representing Florida sheriffs, police chiefs and police officers.
Rep. Jeff Kottkamp, R-Cape Coral, said the bill reminded him of a sign he saw on a constituent's house while campaigning door-to-door.
Kottkamp said the sign, next to a doorbell, showed a smoking .44-Magnum handgun and the words: "We don't dial 911."
This is great news for Florida gun carriers because now to defend yourself you don't have to first make sure a "duty to retreat" is impossible.
Currently, if one's life is threatened he / she must make sure it is impossible to escape before using deadly force on an attacker.
Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Mohammed Al-Douri, the first Iraqi official to concede defeat in the U.S.-led war, met privately with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but refused to talk about rumors that he was planning to leave New York.
``I am sorry, '' he said.
``No Answer. ''
``No comment at all.
This is my last word to you, '' he told hordes of journalists who chased him Thursday at his New York residence and U.N. headquarters seeking comment on his talks with the secretary-general, his future and the war.
Asked who should govern Iraq, Al-Douri said: ``I have nothing to do with that. ''
Annan also declined to comment on Thursday's meeting with Al-Douri.
With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game is over '' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace.
He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad.
Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in the Delegate's Lounge.
``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to the secretary-general and what will be his next steps, '' said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his own meeting with Annan.
In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night, Al-Douri said he will continue to work at the United Nations and had no intention of defecting.
``Defecting from who? '' he asked.
``I think the government has already defected.
There is no more Iraqi government to be defected from. ''
Annan said early Thursday -- before meeting Al-Douri -- that in talks with the envoy Monday, ``he didn't ask for an asylum or protection... (and) he didn't ask me for help with his status. ''
``We did talk about what happens, depending on the evolution of things on the ground, '' Annan said.
The ambassador had vehemently defended his country for months as the United States and its allies sought U.N. backing for war on Iraq.
Privately, many U.N. diplomats see him as a respectable colleague.
``I sympathize with his need to create a new life for himself, '' said Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.
Al-Douri taught international law at Baghdad University for over 30 years before becoming a diplomat in 1999, first at the United Nations in Geneva and since early 2001 at U.N. headquarters in New York.
He said in the AP interview he would love to return to teaching but for now he plans to remain at the United Nations.
``Things will be crystalized one day, '' he said.
``What I worried about is that things are settled in the country... so in the future the Iraqi people will live in peace without sanctions, without wars, without suffering.
This is my message. ''
Separately, lawyers who claim that Iraq helped plan the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal court in New York to force Al-Douri to testify in the case and hold the envoy in contempt, saying they worry that he would flee the country.
But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Al-Douri still has diplomatic immunity as Iraq's ambassador.
Under U.N. rules, a new Iraqi government would have to ask to represent the country, which the General Assembly would then consider.
``He is still Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations, '' White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in Washington.
``Legally, that is the way it works at the U.N. ''
Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, which represent 14 survivors and victims' relatives who have filed a $1.5 billion federal lawsuit against Iraq in Washington, said his organization had served a subpoena on Al-Douri twice, on March 26 and March 28, but said he has not responded.
U.S. District Judge John S. Martin did not immediately rule but scheduled a hearing for next week.
The April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building was the deadliest terrorist strike on American soil at the time.
The suit claims Iraqi officials provided money and training to convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh and conspirator Terry Nichols.
McVeigh was executed in 2001, and Nichols is serving a life sentence.
The United States and Britain are preparing a resolution that would give the United Nations a role in humanitarian relief but not peacekeeping in Iraq, a senior official in U.S. President George W. Bush's administration said Friday.
Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military and humanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American, British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Six European countries have agreed to contribute troops to the British and Polish sectors to create an international stability force, the official said.
The draft resolution would limit the U.N. role to helping with refugees and displaced people, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance, the official said.
The United States and Britain agree on all but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the official said, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced.
U.N. officials are already in Iraq providing humanitarian relief.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that the body has no interest in policing a postwar Iraq, although it could contribute to the political resuscitation of the country.
``Take the question of security.
I don't think the U.N. would want to take on that, '' Annan said.
``There has been a suggestion that the U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also not the case. ''
What the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation, '' Annan said.
The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from other U.N. Security Council members who have favored a U.N.-convened conference of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan's post-Taliban government.
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld discussed the resolution with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on Friday as Rumsfeld returned from a tour of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf region.
Rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the U.N. would play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution outlining that role.
Hoon, who joined Rumsfeld in a news conference at Heathrow airport, also did not mention the draft resolution.
``We are right to be optimistic about the way forward '' in Iraq, Hoon said.
International stability forces will be sent to Iraq as soon as possible, the U.S. official said, though it was unclear when that would be.
Those troops will work to restore and maintain order and supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and electricity and delivery of food and medical aid.
The six nations contributing troops are Italy, Spain, Ukraine, Denmark, the Netherlands and Bulgaria, the official said.
Representatives of those countries will meet with British officials May 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces each country will contribute and whether they will be put under British or Polish command.
The U.S. part of the stability force will be comprised of American troops.
While that portion is likely to consist of a military division -- about 20,000 -- the troop strength of the other two sectors has yet to be determined, the official said.
The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. war commander, Gen. Tommy Franks.
At least initially, the coalition stability forces will augment rather than replace the 135,000 American troops inside Iraq, the official said.
The stability forces will focus on providing security and humanitarian relief while other U.S. troops focus on rooting out leftover members of Saddam Hussein's government and other armed elements in Iraq.
Rumsfeld said, however, that the more troops other countries contribute to the stability effort, the fewer U.S. troops will be needed inside Iraq.
Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international security force left out France, Germany and Russia, three U.S. allies that vehemently opposed the war in Iraq.
Some of the NATO members who agreed to send troops may want NATO authorization for that action, the official said.
Requests for such authorization will be routed through the alliance's defense planning committee, which does not include France, the official said.
The outlines for the international stability force were decided at a conference Hoon hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16 countries, mostly NATO members.
Other countries including the Philippines, South Korea, Qatar and Australia agreed to send other help such as field hospitals, engineers, explosive ordnance disposal teams or nuclear, biological and chemical weapons experts.
The U.S., British and Polish sectors will be drawn to take into account ethnic, religious, tribal and political factions within Iraq, the official said.
For example, although ethnic Kurds are the majority in large parts of northern Iraq, there are also large numbers of Kurds within Baghdad.
Some Arab countries also want to play a role in the stability operation in Iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of political, religious and ethnic considerations, the official said.
Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to donate money for the effort.
Rumsfeld also met Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan, an American ally in the Middle East.
Defense officials say Jordan provided key help in the Iraq war, acting as a staging area for U.S. special operations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from being fired at Jordan or Israel.
Rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed.
Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and critically injured two children, ages 7 and 9, during conflicts in the West Bank that erupted Tuesday as Israeli and Palestinian leaders moved toward talks on a new Mideast peace plan.
The shootings -- which the Israeli army said came in response to attacks by Palestinians throwing stones and molotov cocktails -- came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel's occupation in the West Bank must end, stunning both dovish opponents and hardline allies.
Sharon's remarks and Israel's conditional acceptance Sunday of the so-called ``road map '' to peace were expected to jump-start stalled Mideast peace negotiations.
A summit between Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, had been planned for Wednesday but was postponed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials, who blamed each other for the delay.
The officials said no new date had been set; Israel Radio said the meeting would take place Thursday.
A three-way summit with U.S. President George W. Bush could take place as early as next week, possibly in Jordan.
Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and wounded a 7-year-old boy after opening fire at stone throwers in the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday, Palestinian hospital officials said.
The army said troops fired, and hit a boy, after a Palestinian youth threw a molotov cocktail.
In a village near the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday, Israeli troops opened fire on youths throwing stones, hitting a 9-year-old Palestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him, and hitting two 12-year-old boys in the legs, lightly wounding them, Palestinian hospital officials said.
A 10-year-old boy was struck in the leg by a rubber bullet, but was not seriously hurt, the officials said.
Military sources said troops were trying to break up stone-throwing protests, but did not use live fire.
The army was not aware of any injuries.
Five Palestinian children, a Palestinian woman and a police officer, were injured Tuesday after accidentally detonating explosives in the West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian security officials said.
The children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and accidentally detonated the first bag.
After a police officer arrived, the second bag exploded, seriously injuring him, the officials said.
Israeli troops killed a Palestinian teenager Monday and another surrendered after infiltrating from Gaza, the military said.
They were unarmed and apparently looking for work.
In a village near the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, an 11-year-old Palestinian boy was killed during an exchange of gunfire.
Also Monday, Israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, diplomats said.
There were no injuries from the incident.
Peter Lundberg, an official from the Swedish Consulate in Jerusalem, said that two bullets hit the windshield of the Swiss Consulate's armored car, and that small-arms fire also was directed at other cars from Sweden, Denmark and the European Union.
Military sources said the Israeli army had established roadblocks at the entrance to Beit Hanoun to prevent Palestinians militants from leaving the area.
The sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.
The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance of the U.S.-backed ``road map '' peace plan.
Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank could endanger Israel's existence.
Skeptics, however, wondered whether Sharon's conversion was a shrewd effort to deflect U.S. pressure in the hopes the road map would fail before Israel had to make tough concessions.
``To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them, '' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio.
The term ``occupation '' is anathema to the Israeli right, which believes Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and Gaza Strip for religious and security reasons.
Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word ``occupation '' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and Gaza and dismantle Jewish settlements.
Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state.
On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the ``road map, '' a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005.
Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict, including an Israeli withdrawal from West Bank population centers.
``This can't continue endlessly.
Do you want to remain forever in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus? '' he asked.
Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the Palestinians and endangers Israel.
In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.
``What will happen if Palestinian terror continues?
Nothing.
Nothing will happen.
The Palestinians will get nothing, '' he said.
Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks.
Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his intentions murky to persuade the U.S. government that he was committed to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end U.S. pressure.
``Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knows where he is headed, '' Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
A retired navy officer facing life in prison over a failed effort to protect Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, told a court Thursday he felt remorse for his part in the 1999 plot.
``I have a guilty conscience, '' Andonis Naxakis said during his two-hour testimony.
Naxakis is one of 13 people on trial for bringing the fugitive guerrilla leader to Greece.
Ocalan was moved by the government to its embassy compound in Kenya, where he was captured by Turkish commandos.
The retired Greek officer said he had been trying to get Ocalan to The Netherlands, home to a large Kurdish community.
He claimed he had been manipulated by the government.
``I believe I was unwittingly used as bait for its disgraceful plan... an organized move by the government to hand Ocalan over to Turkey, '' he said.
Naxakis and two of Ocalan's Kurdish associates are being tried on criminal charges of endangering national security.
Ocalan, being tried in absentia, was indicted for entering the country illegally, a misdemeanor.
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is serving a life sentence in Turkey for leading a 15-year insurgency against the country that left 37,000 people dead.
He is being tried in Greece in absentia.
The summit is coinciding with more unrest in several areas of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
Hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians stormed the Israeli-controlled section of Hebron, breaking a curfew imposed since the outbreak of the unrest last month.
Witnesses said Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets, wounding at least seven people.
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched in the area to protest against a renewal of contacts with Israel.
The name Father Frost may not be familiar to you, but to Russian children, Christmas wouldn't be the same without him.
Denise Dillon reports.
Santa Claus visited the northern Russian city of Veliki Ustyug to meet with his Russian counterpart, Father Frost.
It's believed Veliki Ustyug, which is about 600 miles north of Moscow, is the hometown of Father Frost, one of the main characters of Russian Christmas stories.
The 50,000 residents here have a deep respect for the history of their town, and it seemed as though all of them bundled up against the cold and came out to welcome Santa and Father Frost as they rode into the town's central square on a horse-drawn carriage.
People who live here hope this is the beginning of a long tradition that others around the world will celebrate with them.
A new great holiday came to our town.
This is how new traditions are generated.
And I hope this holiday will become nationwide soon.
As for us, we are always happy to see guests in our town.
When Santa arrived, the temperature was 16 degrees below 0, but that did not stop the Russian folk singers and dancers from performing traditional dances.
Later, Santa visited Father Frost's home, where they met with all the good little boys and girls.
When you believe in Santa Claus, then you are good people and good children.
Then your dreams can come true.
Children around the world believe that Santa Claus or Father Frost will bring them good luck, and presents, for the holidays.

Edmund Pope, the U.S. businessman convicted of espionage in Russia, is offering the first details of his eight-month stay in a Moscow prison.
Speaking from a U.S. military hospital in Germany, Pope says he was treated well by prison guards, but suffered from mental anguish and depression.
Today, Pope is undergoing an extensive medical checkup, to see if there is any recurrence of bone cancer.
He's undergoing tests for skin cancer as well.
He will wait for the results before returning home to the U.S.
Pope was pardoned yesterday by Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Just reported from AP that Condi Rice has been chosen by President Bush to become the new Secretary of State for his second term.
I agree with his choice and think she will make a much better Secretary then Powell did.
Her views are much more in step with the President then Powell, although he was a true soldier and carried the message.
Plus, any lady who works out to Led Zeppelin and is a Football nut is alright in my book.
The bodies of 2 more American sailors were recovered today from the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden.
US officials are on the scene and continuing their investigations into the explosion that killed 17 crewmembers on board the Cole last Thursday.
Today there are reports that police in Aden questioned the landlord of an apartment where bomb-making equipment was found and whose occupants may have carried out the suicide attack against the warship.
Also today at the Cole's homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, President Clinton led a memorial service for those who died aboard the Cole.
The service began with the playing of the national anthem.
The President asked all Americans to take a moment to thank the men and women of the military.
Today we honor our finest young people, fallen soldiers who rose to freedom's challenge.
We mourn their loss, celebrate their lives, and offer the love and prayers of a grateful nation to their families.
Mr. Clinton mentioned the name of each of the 17 victims and praised the courage and character of the men and women who serve in the armed forces.
And he delivered this clear message for those who carry out attacks on members of US military.
For those who attacked them we say you will not found the safe harbor.
We will find you and justice will prevail.
America will not stop standing guard for peace, or freedom, or stability in the Middle East and around the world.
At the end of the somber ceremony, President Clinton asked everyone to join him in a moment of silence followed by the Navy Hymn and Taps.
Missouri residents remembered Governor Mel Carnahan today.
He died Monday night in a plane crash while campaigning for the Senate.
Thousands attended a ceremony at the Missouri State capital.
President and Mrs. Clinton were among the mourners.
A former US Army sergeant has pleaded guilty in New York to conspiracy in the bombings of American Embassies in east Africa in 1998.
Ali Mohammed, a native of Egypt, has admitted to five charges of conspiring with a Saudi born dissident Osama bin Laden to attack US targets in the Middle-East.
More than 220 people died in the blasts.
In 1998, the United States voted against the creation of the World's first permanent International War Crimes Court.
President Clinton still has a chance to sign the treaty creating the Court before a final deadline this Sunday.
Advocates are pressing him to do just that, but Conservatives in Congress and Pentagon officials don't want the US to join the treaty.
The World's Jeb Sharp explains why.
Jesse Helms, the Conservative and powerful Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has made it clear the Rome's statuette would be dead on arrival if it were brought to Congress for ratification.
But proponents of the permanent International Criminal Court would still like to see President Clinton at least sign the treaty before the New Year's eve deadline.
Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch says Clinton's signature would be an important symbolic gesture.
What he will accomplish is making a clear statement that the United States not only in the former Yugoslavia, not only in Rwanda, not only in Cambodia, not only in Sierra Leone, where the administration has supported efforts at justice, but worldwide the United States supports the rule of law and supports holding those accused of genocide to account under the highest standards of due process.
But the opposition here in the United States is intense.
It comes mainly from the Pentagon where US military officials fear the Court will leave Americans vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions.
Negotiators have tried to include safeguards in the treaty to address those fears, but stop short of exempting US personnel from prosecution.
John Bolton of the American Enterprise Institute shares the Pentagon's objections.
I think there is every prospect such a court and its prosecutor would be highly politicized and the principal target of a court like this might well turn out to be the United States or Israel or other countries like that.
Bolton says that almost happened at the War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, when Chief Prosecutor Carla Delponte briefly contemplated an investigation of NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999.
But proponents of the court say it's healthy for the United States and its allies to come under the same scrutiny as other countries.
Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch says Delponte's handling of the NATO case was exemplary.
Carla Delponte was acting as any responsible prosecutor must when she receives credible allegations of wrongdoing.
She looked into those allegations and then after an appropriate investigation she dismissed them.
Richard Dicker says President Clinton should keep the promise he made to the Rwandan people in 1998 when he told survivors of the genocide there the United States would support the International Court.
But John Bolton of the American Enterprise Institute says a Clinton signature in the face of stiff domestic opposition would be meaningless.
I think it's a symbolic act that doesn't achieve much, but I don't think anybody internationally should think that whatever President Clinton does will have the slightest impact on the next administration.
Despite American objections, the International Criminal Court enjoys wide support worldwide and among major US allies.
131 countries have signed the treaty, 7 today and 25 have ratified it.
60 nations in all must ratify the treaty for the International Criminal Court to come into existence.
That's expected to happen, with or without US support, in 2002.

The death toll in Colombia from three days of heavy fighting between soldiers and rebels now stands at more than 100.
At least 54 soldiers and 50 guerillas have died in clashes around the northwestern cities of Bagado and Dabeiba.
Nearly all of the buildings, government buildings in those two cities, have been reportedly destroyed.
The clashes began Wednesday, when the rebel revolutionary armed forces of Colombia launched attacks on a number of northwestern towns.
An army helicopter went down close to the border with Panama, killing all 22 soldiers on board.
In Yemen, a bomb threat has forced the tightening of security at the hotel housing US investigators probing the attack on the USS Cole.
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters the situation caused the Secretary of Defense to call US field commanders.
The Secretary held a video conference call with all the commanders in chiefs, as well as the service chiefs and the service secretaries and the topic was force protection.
The hotel has been hosting scores of investigators who are looking into the apparent suicide bomb attack on the navy destroyer that killed 17 US sailor two weeks ago.
It was a parent's ultimate nightmare.
As the crippled jet prepared for an emergency landing, Sylvia Tsao wrapped her 23-month-old son, Evan, in blankets and, following cabin-crew orders, placed him on the floor.
She held him down tightly, trying to protect him.
"Suddenly, the world seemed to end," she told investigators later.
Crashing into a cornfield, United Airlines' Flight 232 flipped over, and she lost her grip on her son.
"I saw for an instant my son's body floating and flying" toward the back of the plane, Ms. Tsao recalled.
When the plane stopped moving, she frantically tried to find him.
But Evan died of smoke inhalation.
July's Sioux City crash has fueled an emotionally charged debate.
Safety advocates and members of Congress, calling babies "the neglected population," are stepping up a campaign for the mandatory use of infant safety seats on all flights.
But the Federal Aviation Administration is reluctant to require separate seats for babies because of the added cost for traveling parents.
Some FAA officials note that few infants have been killed in plane crashes, raising the question of whether safety seats really are needed.
A 1981 Harvard Medical School study that scrutinized accidents in the late 1970s concluded that perhaps three babies would have been saved in a five-year period if safety-seat use had been required.
The National Transportation Safety Board will take a close look at the issue during four days of hearings that begin today on the broader issue of what caused the crash that killed 112 people.
"Infants', toddlers' and young children's safety should no longer be ignored as if they don't count," Mrs. Tsao wrote to the board in advocating use of the safety seats.
All 50 states require that small children be strapped into safety seats in cars.
On planes, FAA rules dictate that children two years old and over have their own tickets and be strapped into regular seats, just as adults are.
Babies under two may sit on laps and fly for free.
But it is almost impossible to keep hold of a baby during an air crash, or even in severe turbulence.
During the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson of Cincinnati lost her grip on her baby as the plane lurched and tipped over.
Another passenger heard one-year-old Sabrina's cry and pulled her from an overhead luggage compartment.
The FAA encourages the use of safety seats, but in the past many parents have run into problems trying to use them, even when the plane was only half-full or they had bought an extra ticket especially for the baby.
When Vanessa Merton, an associate dean at Pace University School of Law, decided to take her young son to Europe last spring, she called four carriers to ask about their policies on car seats.
"The people acted like I was transporting heroin," she says.
One reservation agent told her -- incorrectly -- that the airline barred the use of the seats on flights.
After the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson bought a car seat for her daughter for the flight home to Cincinnati.
But on one leg of the trip, she was ordered by a flight attendant to take Sabrina out of the seat and hold her during takeoff and landing -- the most dangerous parts of any flight.
Airlines say that such mistakes are decreasing in the aftermath of Sioux City, but proponents of the safety devices say they still get complaints from parents.
"People are told one thing on the phone, another at check in, another at the gate, and another on the plane," says Stephanie Tombrello, executive director of the Los Angeles Area Child Passenger Safety Association, which petitioned the FAA in June for mandatory use of child-safety seats.
The Association of Flight Attendants, the main flight attendants' union, is strongly backing that request.
The FAA argues that requiring safety seats for all babies might actually diminish, not enhance, safety.
As part of such a rule, officials say, parents would probably be required to buy an extra ticket for the baby.
The increased cost of flying would inevitably encourage some families to drive rather than fly, they say.
Commercial airlines have the lowest accident rate of all transportation modes -- much lower than cars, for example.
Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting Executive Director for Regulatory Standards and Compliance, contends that the current rule is the best approach because it allows parents to make their own decision on whether to use a safety seat.
But he admits that the agency is in "a very uncomfortable position."
He says the agency soon will propose that airlines be prohibited from denying the use of safety seats.
(Most airlines don't prohibit their use.)
He says the agency also will seek public comment on whether the seats should be required.
Walter Coleman, Vice President of Operations for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major airlines, describes the call for safety seats as "legitimate" and says the group is studying the issue.
But privately some airline officials fear that if parents must buy extra tickets for babies, whole families will stop flying.
Others worry that the FAA might write a rule forcing airlines to pick up part of the tab for increased infant safety.
Generally, airlines say they welcome the use of a government-approved safety seat and will even allow the restraint to take up a regular seat for free if the flight isn't crowded.
(Most car seats made in recent years are certified for use on aircraft and are so marked.)
But space can only be guaranteed if a ticket is purchased.
What the industry really wants is some kind of device that would protect babies without taking up an extra seat.
But no one has come up with anything that is safer in a crash than the current practice of bundling babies up and trying to pin them to the floor.
Parents are advised against holding the infants, for fear that in an accident the babies could be crushed by the adult's weight.
Proponents of safety seats are turning up the heat on the FAA.
Yesterday, Rep. James Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican, sent FAA Administrator James Busey a letter signed by 56 House members urging the agency to require infant safety seats.
If the FAA refuses, Rep. Lightfoot says, he will push legislation to require the change.
He must be on the phone.
Maybe I can go.
That's where her brother went.
That's what you think.
You could always come back tomorrow.
Oh I remember him.
Do you like him?
Did you lock the door?
Did you feed the cat today?
I am really uncomfortable right now.
I am completely exhausted.
Usually you have to wait in line for hours.
Have you seen his new place yet?
How many people are going to be there?
Why does it matter?
I didn't sleep at all last night.
Could you turn it down a little bit?
It doesn't matter.
She has two kids.
Buckle up.
The elevator's broken.
I don't have cash.
Did you see that?
Go away.
She went that way.
Could you please close the door?
This episode is hilarious.
I was so tired!
Go see a doctor!
What are you doing this summer?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
What do you think is going to happen?
Sorry, you have the wrong number.
You never pick up.
I locked myself out. That can't be good. Don't worry about it, it'll be fine.
Hold the elevator please!
What are you looking for?
I'll be in my room.
There's ice cream in the freezer.
She didn't seem to mind.
I need coffee.
I need a haircut.
How long will you be here?
What's your number?
Are you sure?
She's going to be so angry.
I go there all the time.
Do you know how to cook?
Can I borrow a pen?
I lost my book.
There's too much wind.
Do you have tokens?
I want to watch a movie.
Oh, I see.
I ate too much.
We're out of toilet paper.
Check in the closet.
I have three missed calls.
I forgot to call her back.
What's going on?
I'm confused. I think we all are.
I can't wait to go back to school.
I need to make an appointment.
I got a ticket last month.
I need to come in earlier.
I have a question.
What time do you have?
Look who's talking.
Good deal.
Let me know if there's a problem.
Did you do that on purpose?
You know what I mean.
Email me the details.
He's a nice boy.
That's so unhealthy!
Do you want me to call you?
That's great!
I'm sure we can work something out.
Where do you work?
Do you work during the school year?
Don't worry about it.
She's going abroad.
Give me a call back.
Could you call me back tomorrow?
Take a guess.
You scared me!
You're too nice.
Stand up for just a second.
Have fun without me!
I'm going next week.
Why is it so cold in here?
You guys are so loud.
We had so much fun.
Let's go some place else.
I can't think of anything else.
Do you want to just call it a day?
My telephone was disconnected.
He's out to lunch.
Let me get back to you in a few minutes.
Thank you very much.
May I ask why?
That's strange!
Why don't we eat out?
Not when you're hungry.
I thought you didn't like cookies.
I'll have some salad, roast beef, and mashed potatoes.
I'd like decaf.
I'd like ham and eggs, please.
Is there anything else?
Wow, I really envy you.
All right.
Around 7: 30 PM.
It's OK.
Don't be silly.
Very soon!
Let it go.
I'll help my mom with the housework.
Are some parts of this city considered more dangerous than others? Which parts?
How many people were there?
Can I help you?
Will there be a lot of traffic on the highway? I don't know. Ask someone else.
Where do I pay?
There's been an accident. Someone is injured.
Are you injured?
I would like to phone my embassy. Please tell them this is an urgent call.
Yes please, call a doctor for me.
My heart is full of love.
Just a moment please. I am coming soon.
Fine, thank you.
Good morning!
How do you do?
Nice to see you.
So so.
Pardon me.
See you tomorrow.
What's new?
Do you have a room for tonight?
Thank you. Bye
I hope to hear from you soon.
Oops!
Please pay the cashier.
I don't feel well.
What is the dish of the day? OK, I'll have that.
Thank you. I'm just looking.
Would you like anything else?
Where can I get a taxi?
What can I do?
Will he come back soon? At 11.00 pm.
What's on television?
What a lovely day!
Is it raining? Yes, it is.
