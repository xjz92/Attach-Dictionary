At the bottom of the sea.
Two months after the submarine "Kursk" went down with 118 men on board, divers have managed to get inside.
They found five bodies so far.
And today, they found a note, written after a pair of explosions ripped through the hull and sent the "Kursk" into the depths of the Barents see.
Here's ABC's bob woodruff.
The note was discovered by divers inside one compartment of the submarine, on the body of 27-year-old lieutenant captain Dmitry Kolesnikov, photographed here on board the "Kursk" three years ago.
"I am writing blindly," he wrote apparently in darkness.
"None of us can get to the surface."
Russian officials believe the note was written at least two hours after the sub began to sink.
"All the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the ninth."
Kolesnikov wrote, "There are 23 people here.
We made this decision as a result of the accident. "
The note contains no new evidence about what sank the "Kursk," whether it was an internal explosion or a collision.
But it does contradict the official Russian version that was given to family members, that all 118 men had died instantly.
Today, the chief of Russia's navy was forced to admit to the families he was wrong, that some of the crew not only survived, according to Kolesnikov's note,
Two or three tried to get out through the escape hatch.
But it may have been flooded.
Today, Kolesnikov's widow could not hold back her tears.
"It's horribly painful, it's awful," she said.
"I had a feeling that he didn't die immediately, and it turned out my feeling was right."
She also says her husband had a premonition.
Last summer, before he went to sea, he gave her his dog tag and a crucifix, and said he may not be coming back.

The skeleton of a second baby has been found at a rural Wisconsin home where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a blue plastic container June 8, officials said Monday.
Kristin Scott, the mother, told police she gave birth secretly to both babies at her parents' home in Byrds Creek, Richland County, one of unknown sex in April 2001 and the other, a fullterm girl, January 14.
Police arrested her in Abilene, Texas, Saturday where she had moved with a friend June 2.
She is being held on 50,000 dollars bail on a charge of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of the infant born in January.
Scott told police she did not tend to the baby, and it died after 30 minutes.
She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal complaint.
The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing body of the first baby in her closet after they went looking for the source of a foul odor in their house.
Scott told investigators she had moved that body around before she moved to Texas, sometimes in the closet at the Byrds Creek house, in the trunk of her car and in the closet of her apartment in Richland Center, the complaint said.
The sheriff released no other details about the second baby.
Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just threw out the convictions of their martyr, Andrea Yates, by ruling that one of the prosecutor's expert witnesses gave false testimony at her trial.
Yates, in case you have forgotten, is the women from Texas who heinously drowned her five kids, aged 6 months to 7 years, one by one, in her bathtub.
Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates' defense, most notably the National Organization for Women, which provided money for her defense fund and held candlelight vigils.
No such ceremonies were held for her five dead children.
In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of three of her children.
She was not tried in the deaths of the other two.
Today the 1st Court of Appeals overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial.
We can only hope for the same verdict.
Kurdish militiamen and U.S. special operations troops linked up with more than 1,000 U.S. Army paratroopers Thursday to secure the area around a strategic air strip, as the first large coalition ground force in northern Iraq began opening another front against Saddam Hussein's regime.
The Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, including elite Army Rangers, jumped out of low-flying C-17 transport planes under cover of darkness Wednesday and secured a snow-dusted airfield, which will be used to bring in supplies and support personnel.
The airdrop -- one of the biggest paratroop drops in decades -- was a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small groups of U.S. special forces have been operating.
Coalition airstrikes have been hitting Iraqi military forces and other strategic targets in the north.
``This tightens the noose against Saddam's forces battling coalition forces to the south, '' Brig. Gen. James Parker, commander of U.S. forces in the north.
``And it may also serve as a warning to Turkish forces. ''
Giving cover for the deployment, U.S. warplanes struck Iraqi ground troops and bunkers in northern Iraq.
Three waves of combat planes from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt hit ``ground troops, command and control bunkers, artillery positions and... a surface to air missile battery, '' said Lt. John Oliveira, the ship's public affair officer.
Around dawn Thursday, strikes resumed, with a massive explosion just outside the Kurdish zone close to the village of Kalak.
Warplanes pounded forward Iraqi positions in the hills overlooking Chamchamal, 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the key oil city of Kirkuk.
Later Thursday, Kurdish troops in Chamchamal advanced their positions between government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas, taking over a Iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point, witnesses said.
Early Thursday, Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near the airstrip where troops were said to be arriving, outside the town of Bashur, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of the Kurd-controlled city of Irbil and 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of the Turkish border.
From the highway, dusted from a recent snow, a flashing light from the airstrip's control tower was visible in the distance, and three helicopters could be seen landing, flying with nearly all their lights extinguished.
Future airlifts into the area will include supplies and support personnel for the 173rd's fighters, defense officials said.
The airfield's 6,700-foot (2,042-meter) runway is long enough to land C-17s and other U.S. military cargo planes.
Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Southern European Task Force, refused to say whether the paratroopers deployed directly from Italy into Iraq or had taken a different route.
The matter immediately sparked controversy in Italy, where there is a strong anti-war movement.
The country's parliament voted this month to allow U.S.-led coalition forces to use Italian air space and military bases -- but not for directs attacks on Iraq.
Pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have U.S. forces in northern Iraq to open another front against Saddam's forces.
The vast majority of the coalition ground troops in Iraq are moving toward Baghdad from the south after entering from Kuwait.
Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army's 4th Infantry Division invade Iraq from the north, but Turkey balked at allowing up to 62,000 U.S. troops on its soil to prepare for that option.
The use of the 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller, lighter force.
Military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil fields around the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk -- and perhaps the cities themselves -- by now.
Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment, the 173rd decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect itself, officers said, according to a U.S. reporter traveling with the 173rd.
``Kirkuk is key.
The Iraqi's want it, the Kurds want it, the Turks want it and various other ethnic groups also want it, '' Maj. Mike Hastings said.
``What this drop means is that we can secure it until we are relieved by other forces. ''
Besides Mosul and Kirkuk, another key target in northern Iraq is Tikrit, Saddam's hometown and the tribal center for most of his inner circle.
Most of the Adnan Division of the Republican Guard relocated from the Mosul area to the Tikrit area shortly before the war began.
Another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northern Iraq, which is controlled by two semi-autonomous Kurdish factions but also includes several splinter groups and a base for the al-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Islam.
Turkey has said it may send more troops into northern Iraq to prevent refugees from moving north, while U.S. officials have said they advised Turkey against sending large additional forces into northern Iraq.
Police intercepted 33 African immigrants who came ashore Thursday in southern Spain aboard an overcrowded boat, including several pregnant women and other travelers suffering from hypothermia, police said.
Spanish media showed dramatic photos of police struggling to carry women on the verge of fainting after they were found wandering through Tarifa, Spain's windswept southern tip, Civil Guard officials told Spanish news agencies.
Police also arrested two Moroccan men suspected of trafficking in human beings and navigating the Zodiac boat across from Africa, Efe said.
Twenty-six of the would-be immigrants were from sub-Saharan Africa, six of them women, and the other seven were males from North African countries, police said.
Red Cross officials administered first aid on the scene, and the detainees were taken to a processing center for the government to begin expulsion proceedings.
Tens of thousands of destitute Africans try to enter Spain illegally each year by crossing the perilous Strait of Gibraltar to reach the southern mainland or by sailing northwest to the Canary Islands out in the Atlantic.
They seek a better life doing menial jobs in Spain or hope to use the country as a stepping stone to other points in Europe.
Most are caught trying to sneak in and some die in the attempt.
Five of the U.S. sailors killed in the attack on the destroyer "USS Cole" are now home.

The nuclear submarine "Kursk" could become a permanent underwater grave for 118 Russian sailors.
Russia's top admiral says he may scrap efforts to recover the bodies if experts decide the mission would endanger deep sea divers.
All those aboard the "Kursk" were killed in August when the sub sank after being damaged by an explosion in the Barents Sea.
The cause of the disaster has not been determined.
An international salvage team is due to arrive at the scene of the accident tomorrow.
A U.S. businessman accused of spying says he has no chance of getting a fair trial in Russia.

2Slick pointed me to a article at In Iraq For 365.
This is a great blog and I encourage you all to read it regularly.
On Sunday he wrote of two Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when the Mosul bombing occurred.
The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragments throughout the Marez dining facility.
One piece of shrapnel sliced through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance for survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.
Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the special forces, the Iraqis reacted calmly, fastening a belt above the wound, creating a tourniquet, which stopped the gushing stream of red.
They moved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry.
After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety.
When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health.
When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was.
When asked why did they do it, they simply stated, "this was our duty; we are a team, and we take care of each other."
Even the Americans.
No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country.
This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq.
When I meet the people working alongside the United Nations--Iraqis in fear of their life every day, because they are trying to bring freedom and democracy to their people--when I see their courage and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom, then I know that we are doing the right thing.
And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better.
Now what should our response be as an international community?
Our response should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who've got the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through.
I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do.
Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening in Iraq in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is.
And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq--every day... a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside.
They do not know at any point in time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation, even death, and yet they carry on doing it.
Now what a magnificent example of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.
Thousands of people in Botswana have lined up to view the remains of an African man whose body was stuffed and exhibited in a Spanish museum for nearly a century.
The man was returned to Africa after complaints from the UN and other organizations that displaying his body was racist and offensive.
The man will be buried at a funeral service tomorrow.

The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms.
"The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China," an FDA spokesman said yesterday.
The agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until "satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent" bacterial contamination.
On May 19, the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi, New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms.
In subsequent tests, the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated.
The outbreaks were traced to Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables.
A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March.
In 1987, China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the U.S.
The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken "many effective measures" to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes.
He predicted the problem will be solved "very soon."
Five Iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed Monday when their houses were hit by a missile fired by the US-led coalition warplanes, witnesses said.
Their houses are located in Al-Azamiyah, one of the most populous areas in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, they said.
One house was destroyed during the strike and casualties have been removed from the area.
The US-led coalition forces launched a new round of airstrikes on Baghdad at 2: 30 p.m. (1130GMT) on Monday.
Huge explosions were heard in different parts of Baghdad and air raid siren sounded throughout the capital city, they said, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery had begun to fire back.
Although the coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that every effort would be made to minimize civilian casualties in the current Iraq war, at least 130 Iraqi civilians have been reportedly killed since the war started five days ago.
According to other reports reaching here, five Syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others were injured on Sunday morning when a US missile hit the bus they were traveling in near the Iraqi border.

I can call her later.
I got an email from her yesterday.
That sounds good.
It'll just take me a second.
I didn't say anything.
Did she tell you what happened?
I haven't been here in forever.
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

My computer froze.
Can we work in groups?
What did you say?
I don't care.
I don't know.
