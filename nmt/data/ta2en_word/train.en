Intention to change the border is foolishness .

I reiterate that India is ready for dialogue .
We cannot get friendship through war and pressure .
We want to live peacefully

Allowing the sheep to quarrel and foxes to drink the blood : People should be cautious on caste associations . Chief Minister Karunanidhi spoke on the release of Irattaimalai Srinivasan postal stamp .
Chennai Aug. 16- Irattaimalai Srinivasan postal stamp release function was celebrated yesterday evening on behalf of Tamil Nadu Govt. at Chennai Caraivanar auditorium .
Chief Minister Kanunanidhi presided over the function and released the postal stamps of Irattaimalai Srinivasan .
M. D. M
K.
General Secretary Vaiko M.P received this in the function .
Chief Minister Karunanidhi said : -
My brother Vaiko is sitting here after giving a speech in his own style of explaining with speed .
On the first day when I spoke social reform as main matter , most of the speech was centered around Irettaimalai Srinivasan .
Irettaimalai
When we read his life history we will come to know that he suffered a lot due to un-touchability .
He was born in Koliyalam village , Chengalpati district , T N on 7.7.1989 .
All could have thought .
Even when I was coming from Raj Bhawan our Minister Tamil Kudimagan , the well learned , asked me when is the next program , I said Irattaimalai Srinivasan program .
For that he said , oh that one , we are both from Irettaimalai in Chengalpati district .
I just smiled and said nothing .
He was explaining to brothers Duraimurugan and Veerachamy that there is a place called Irettaimalai .
And he was born there .
I observed silence .
After that , I went to Gopelapuram and while coming to this function I told him .
&quot; What , poet , is Irettaimalai ? A place ? &quot; I asked .
He said yes
That is not a place . Irettaimalai is his father &apos;s name . He joined his father &apos;s name with his as Irettaimalai Srinivasan .
Because of this everybody calls him as &apos; Thaththa &apos; ( grandfather ) , I imagined .
That community people , elders and educated youths call him as Thaththa Irettaimalai Srinivasan only .
To that extent great Irettaimalai Srinivasan worked for that community .
Justice party .
Because of the movement , because of Dravida movement and because of Periyar , we should not forget this .
Hence , even today so many have tried to break the ties between Dravida movement and backward people , but failed .
Fortified .
Breeze .
We have released his postal stamp now .
We gather to the full in Kalaivarar auditorium .
But what are all the things happening in this country ?
In the name of caste , religion , envy , conflict , struggles etc .
In Tamil Nadu , though the breeze is blowing today , in those days there were earthquakes , caste conflicts , etc. which you cannot forget .
Individually one or two persons for their own benefit try to instigate in the name of caste , so one collective feeling , that all the society people should get freedom , should get self-respect .
Should get rights that feeling never comes out .
Foxes .
We should be cautious of them .
That who is protecting us , who is going to be our safety , who is our safeguards , who is going to be our servants guard work for us .
Old days
It is not enough to see history of today .
Should see the history of the past .
I know the past . I was nearly 13 years old , when I got involved in public life .
The place I started my public life is shown only .
Even today , in Tamil districts and in slums half of the flags of Dravida Kazhagam flags which are flying now are planted firmly by the hands of Karunanidhi .
2 movements .
A movement like this , in the past , from childhood onwards worked for that people , having friends , followers and leaders , one movement that is Dravidar movement .
Today that movement could have bifurcated into two or three .
In the separated Dravidar movements the believable two movements today are those two that are gathered in this Kalaivanar Auditorium .
Happy
I released the postal stamp .
Brother Vaiko received that
Here elders said
If I say that this postal stamp is being released with the great efforts of Vaiko , I don &apos;t feel bad .
Happy .
What does a big brother need other than the happiness that his younger brother &apos;s efforts have succeeded ?
It is not surprising that brother Vaiko has succeeded in this type of effort .
I know that if he takes up this type of work he won &apos;t rest until completing that .
Rights
If he is here or there he can complete that .
He has that feeling .
I have the right to say that
Nobody can take that from me at any time .
Nobody can take it from me until I die .
So , brother Vaiko has to do a lot of work
We will say to show that only this has happened .
Let &apos;s us strive hard .
Rao Bahadur Irettaimalai Srinivasan &apos;s pride live long let his thoughts succeed , his philosophies will succeed and we will show the efforts here and by saying this I take leave .
He said

To add to his glory his postal stamp is being released today .
Right
It has been released by Kalaigar who has got the right to all Chief Ministers to hoist national flags on the eve of Independence day and strengthened the democratic values .
When I asked Union Minister Paswan to release a stamp for Irettaimalai Srinivasan he accepted immediately .
Poolithevan
Paswan has accepted my request to release stamps for Poolithevan and Marutha Pandian .
Chief Minister Karunanidhi has to release them .
Dravida movement is to uplift the suppressed people .
In that meditation , leader Kalaigal has made legislations for the upliftment of the suppressed .
Evidence .
In Maharashtra , Kalaligal was supporting to establish a university in the name of Ambedkar .
He only built houses for scheduled castes .
He has given Samaththuvapurams ( egalitarian towns that create non-discriminated society .
They will be historical evidence forever .
Let &apos;s pledge in this function to eradicate caste discrimination and religious conflict in Tamil Nadu as per the philosophy of Irethaimalai Srinivasan .
He said
Ilaya Perumal
Chief Human Rights Commission Ilayaperumal said : -
That the Irettaimalai Srinivasan has the honour of founding Adidravida Mahajana Sangh for the fourth time in India .
Honouring him by releasing his postal stamp by chief minister Karunanidhi is like honouring people of society .
We have promised to struggle for people in Tamil Nadu by taking various measures with Kalaigar .
Kalaigar who set up Samaththuvapuram , Ambedkar College , University will be helpful for the community people &apos;s freedom .
To strike more for suppressed people and Kalaigar to become chief minister again let us strengthen his hands .

TADA prisoners should not be released . Supreme Court sudden orders in a case filed by the father of the police officer who was killed by Veerappan .
have been released on bail .
Mysore Court day before yesterday ordered that the remaining 51 should be released on conditional bail . The case against 121 persons was also withdrawn by the government
Refusal for release
In the meanwhile , the father of S.I. Shakeel Ahmed , Abdul Kareem ( Rt. Superintendent of police ) demanded that Veerappan &apos;s gang members should not be released .
Application was also filed by him in Mysore special court that the case against them should not be withdrawn .
He also appealed against the Mysore Court &apos;s order dismissing this application in the Supreme Court .
The appeal yesterday morning came up before the Supreme Court . The division bench comprising of Justice SP Barucha , Justice SSM Khadri and Justice N Santosh Hegde
is supposed to hear the issue .
Up to 3 O &apos;clock in the evening
The case will be enquired at to 3 O &apos;clock .

This was immediately communicated to the Mysore special Court .
After this , Judge Rajendra Prasad announced that the decision on releasing the 51 prisoners will be taken after 3 O &apos;clock in the evening .
Advocates &apos; arguments .
In this context the issue came up before the Supreme Court last evening .
Then Abdul Kareem &apos;s counsel C. Badri Nath Babu stated : -
It was shocking that Veerappan &apos;s illegal conditions were accepted to release the criminals .
This was taken by the Karnataka Government with some vested political motive .
Veerappan killed a number of elephants for their tusks .
He has smuggled Sandal Wood in plenty .
The money so earned by him must have been shared by Veerappan &apos;s gang members .
The Government has been rendered ineffective .
TADA prisoners should not be released .
Application has been filed in the Special Court at Mysore that the case against them should not be withdrawn .
Despite this , the Judge ordered the release of TADA prisoners .
Only in the interest of administration of justice , cases can be withdrawn .
Supreme Court &apos;s dicta that cases should not be withdrawn on the basis of Government &apos;s policy has been violated by the Special Court .
That the criminals manipulated the Government to get released only shows that the Government has been incapacitated .
My client &apos;s son was killed by Veerappan &apos;s men .
In the same incident Superintendent Hari Krishna was also killed .
In this case , 115 persons including Veerappan figure in the charge sheet .
Out of them only 75 were arrested by the police .
Out of these 45 were released on bail .
For the remaining 30 the Mysore Judge has granted bail .
Karnataka Government ordered withdrawal of the cases .
Should justice be denied ?
By this justice has been denied to those who have suffered due to barbarious acts of Veerappan .
If Veerappan &apos;s gang members are released , it will bring danger to people like me .
The people will panic .
Public peace will be disturbed .
Moreover , there is no right for the State Government to withdraw the cases .
Thus the advocate argued
Refusal
After this , the Government prosecutor argued that Veerappan could not be caught .
In this context , time was demanded for knowing the Karnataka Government &apos;s stand so as to present arguments .
This was rejected by justice Barucha . He ordered interim stay that cases against 30 prisoners who were linked in the case , should not be withdrawn and that they should not be released .
He ordered that till subsequent order they should not be released . He also put a stay on the withdrawal of the case against 115 persons . He adjourned the case till first of the following month .
In the Mysore Court ...
Hadn &apos;t the special judge two days earlier ordered release of 51 persons ?
Out of them 30 were arrested in connection with Shakeel Ahmed &apos;s murder case .
Heeding to the Supreme Court orders , the Mysore Sessions judge Rajendra Prasad adjourned the bail orders indefinitely relating to the 51 persons .
Interview by Krishna
Regarding this the high level committee under the Chairmanship of CM met and consulted .
After this talking to media persons , the CM replied that the Government would file its reply .
As a result of Supreme Court &apos;s judgment there should not be any problem in getting the release of Actor Rajkumar .

That we will never change our stand , Veerappan knows - Karunanidhi .
Yesterday the journalists met CM Karunanidhi at Anna Arivayalayam .
There they raised questions about Veerappan .
To them he replied that he and the Karnataka CM will abide by their promises .
This will be understood by Veerappan .
Since Supreme Court &apos;s case is to be heard on the 1st , nothing more could be said at this stage .
It was more than one month since actor Rajkumar was kidnapped . The problem could not be solved despite three meeting of Govt &apos;s mediator with him .
Coimbatore . Aug 30 - Actor Rajkumar was kidnapped by Veerappan on 30.7.2000 .
Wasn &apos;t it ?
To hold talks with him TAMIL NADU , Karnataka Govt sent Nakkeeran &apos;s editor Gopal .
He met Veerappan twice .

Tamil Nadu &apos;s CM consulted Karnataka CM SM Krishna and both agreed to his 13 demands .
Third visit
Even after the Govt &apos;s response , Veerappan insisted that case against 121 persons should be withdrawn .
Accepting this the Karnataka Government withdrew the case against 121 persons .
This order was passed on through Mr. Gopal .
The special task force &apos;s actions which damaged the peoples property was sought to be compensated by the Karnataka Govt by sanctioning Rs.10 crore .
The documents to this effect were handed over to Gopal

At that time they saw that the corpse &apos;s left eye was taken out and left breast nipple was cut off . He was asked whether he would try to come out on bail , he said that he will try .
By seeing this villagers thought that a fox could have done that .
For fear of the fox Thirumalai could have fallen into the well , they decided .
Body cremated .
Ok let us not talk about this .
Don &apos;t inform the police
If we inform them we will get trouble , perhaps charged etc. so let us cremate the body without informing the police , village people decided and cremated the body .

Villagers decided that this is also the handiwork of a fox and then cremated the body without informing the police .
People feared
Even after these incidents the villagers did not make any attempt to find the cause .
Thirumalai and Adaikkan died ?
What is the reason ?
Though they believed that a fox is the reason for death of these two , they did not make any attempt to capture the fox .
In these circumstances , Alagapuri village is 2 kms away from Alagarkoil on the way to Melur .
One has to walk nearly three quarter distance to reach this village from the main road .
Nobody can go alone after 9.00 pm from this lonely road in Alagarpuri .
Particularly women were afraid to go alone
Even though they have to reach the village by 9 pm villagers have to be careful .
Threat
When asked about the reason , some people came by car and auto and threatened them .
Because of this only villagers dared to come to the village after 9 pm .
And particularly on full moon night the threat is high .
People gathered
Hence , village people are coming into the village with fear and particularly who is threatening women ?
To find out that and capture the culprits .
Alagapuri villages have decided .
As day before yesterday was a full moon day , villagers will hide themselves in the lonely areas at night as per this decision .
One held
3 persons came by that side around 9 pm .
By seeing the 3 Alagapuri people got suspicious
Who are
You ? Asked the villagers and came out of their hideout .
Hearing the sound those 3 started running
Immediately villagers also chased the 3 person
But only one was held out of three
the Other two escaped
Caught
Some villagers cordoned the captured person .
They chased the escaped 2 individuals
Those two were going near Alagarkoil premises by covering their head with a cloth and people who saw them thought that
They may be thieves and caught those 2 persons .
At that time , Alagapuri village people who were chasing those 2 persons reached there and explained the details to those who caught the 2 persons
Police arrived
Alagapuri people who caught the other 2 persons brought them to the village .
On the way police rushed there on receiving the information somehow .
When police came they saw that 2 persons are being brought by the Alagapuri people and asked them to handover those 2 with them , but villagers refused .
However , police insisted that they should be handed over and took them in their van .
When village people told that they have one more person in their custody . Police preceded to Alagapuri along with those 2 persons in the van .
Tied
Before catching and bringing the remaining 2 persons , village people beat up the individual who was caught already .
And tied him to a pillar of the temple and locked the main gate .
Refused to send the van .
Police went to Alagapuri to bring the person caught by village people already .
Those who were there asked the villagers about the escaped two , they said that they caught the 2 individuals
But police have taken those two with them in the van .
And those two are in this van only and they slowed the van .
Immediately village people asked the police how they could take away the persons caught by them and refused to hand over another man .
Village people said that we would not allow you to take those 2 men in the van and they gheraoed the van in the village itself .
Human sacrifice
People enquired the person who was caught and tied up in the temple .
He said that one sadhu is having an ashram near this village .
Karumari Amman temple is there .
It is said that the Amman has asked the priest to sacrifice 49 persons .
Of that , every Amavasya and full moon day we used to catch somebody and hand over him or her to the priest .
He used to sacrifice them whom we have handed out to the priest to the Amman .
Likewise he has sacrificed 8 persons .
We are going to sacrifice more , he said
He was beaten up and asked whether it is true , he said everything is true .
That individual told his name as Ansari Ali and belongs to Parthibanur .
Sadhu runaway .
On the version of Ansari Ali , Alagapuri and Valayampathi Villagers , as if in a cinema , took weapons in their hands and marching towards Ayathan Patti in the Alagar Malai base where Sakthi Puram Karunamai Amma Ashram is situated .
By seeing that the village people are coming , the women gathered over there for full moon night pooja scattered and ran away .
Nalini Sekhar sadhu of A.Vallalpatti who was running from the ashram also left the place and ran away in the down hill area .
Seeing that the sadhu has run away the public destroyed the pooja goods .
They broke the tube lights put up for full moon day pooja .
Collector - SP
Village people told the collector that 3 captured persons should be shown to them
Accepting the villagers request Collector showed the 3 persons captured .
Enquiry
Near Madurai bus stand .
3 were arrested .
They were taken to Melur police station
Inquiry is being conducted with the 3 persons arrested .
Attempt to steal and sell kidney -eye ?
Ansari Ali who was captured by the villagers said that they kidnapped the person for human sacrifice only .
But , seeing the dead bodies of Thirumalai and Adaikkan it is evident that their eyes have been taken out and the abdomen is cut off .
It is suspected that kidney , eyes and important bodyparts were stolen and sold in foreign countries .
For this reason only in the name of Ashram this could have been done , villagers gossip .
Is it true ?
Or really human sacrifice ?
If police inquired in a proper way from the 3 persons arrested , the truth will come out and whether since important persons are beloved this ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or whatelse is uncovered will come out .
If the Ashram is digged out more corpses may come out .
Captured Ansari Ali told the villagers that , so far 8 people have been sacrificed .
But the murder of Alagapuri , Thirumalai and Valayappatti Adaikkan only came out .
According to Ansari Ali it is known that there are about 6 more bodies .
Suspicion raised among the villagers that probably these 6 have been cremated in the Ashram area .
So , if a bulldozer is used to dig the Ashram premises 6 more corpses may come out .
Villagers hope the collector will take action for this .

Ration cards are not being given to them
Most of the incomes are snatched away by the owner of the brothels , pimps , police and ( pawnbrokers ) who give loan on interest .
Question mark
* Most of the women wish to leave this profession
But they couldn &apos;t get any other jobs and without their family ’ s support , their lives become ( question mark )
3 types of women
* We can categories these women into 3 different types
1st type They do not stay at brothels
They only work as prostitute during the day time
They give a particular amount to the brothel owners per customers .
2nd type This type of women permanently stay at brothels .
Give a particular amount every month to the brothel owner .
* 3rd type women Purchased with money and treated as slaves .
Brothel owners take the whole amount earned by those women .
Parents &amp; relatives used to sell these women due to poverty .
There are also people uses job opportunities to trick women into the human market and sell them .
Social custom
* Due to some social custom such as all men are enjoying women in a family .
With the fear that the high society people may rape minor girl , men live in lower society would marry girls in young age .
In younger age , they cannot bear child and rejected by the family and forced to this profession is present .
* Hence the very old Devadasi systems is practiced in some places , so the prostitution continuous .
Though derailed report has been submitted to the Department of women welfare , in order to rescue the women from these atrocities , however , the department authorities did not take any action so far .
As stated in that report if we wish to get a solution for this , if sex work is notified as illegally , women will be free from exploitations .

This is what the draft report of the new curriculum states .
The draft report further says :

General standards and achievements could not be brought on par at the national level .
Entrance examinations are being cancelled .

Did the Pakistani
military come in boats and open fire ? A helicopter sinks in 20 feet of quicksand ; the air force swings into a relief operation .
5 people survived
There were 12 officers belonging to the Border Security Force and air force in the helicopter .
While 7 died , 5 of them survived .
Manish Sharma , the copilot who survived the crash , said that some boats were moving in a suspicious manner in the Kutch area .
To keep watch on them , the helicopter was flying low , at a height of 50 meters .
The helicopter engines were in good condition .
He also said that the theory of the helicopter having been shot down could not be ignored .
CAS Tipnis ’ view
Chief of Air Staff A.Y. Tipnis rushed to Bhuj in the Kutch region yesterday . He met the injured and enquired about the incident .
He said that there was the possibility that this M-8 type of
helicopter was shot down .
But he added that it is premature to say anything about this now .
20 feet deep
The area over which the helicopter parts are strewn is marshy land that adjoins the sea .
There is lot of mud here .
The debris lay buried 20 feet deep .
4 helicopters are put into service to pull out the debris using ropes .
Attempts are also in progress to retrieve the bodies from the debris .
Air force officers said that boats could not be used for the retrieval work .
Mystery boats
Since this incident took place near the Pakistan border , it is presumed that the Pakistan military could have gunned down the helicopter .
The suspicious boats were also stationed at that area for 5 or 6 hours .
These suspicious boats did not come to do rescue work after the crash of the Indian helicopter .
The suspicion that the Pakistani military could have gunned down the helicopter from these boats has grown stronger .
Air force denies
Meanwhile , the air force has denied that Chief of Air Staff Tipnis ever said that Pakistan had shot down the helicopter as reported in a section of the press .
The possibility of Pakistan shooting it down does exist .
But all Tipnis said is that it is premature to say it , explained the air force .
Divers assist
Under these conditions , 7 bodies were retrieved and autopsies were conducted on them yesterday afternoon .
Steps are being taken to hand over the bodies to their relatives .
The air force has sought the assistance of divers and experts to retrieve the engine and the black box that both sank .
5 people critical
5 officers who survived are in intensive care at Bhuj hospital in the Kutch district .
Their condition is said to be critical .
Chief of Air Staff Tipnis visited the hospital yesterday and enquired about their health .
100 farmers ’ markets ; 100 dwellings of equality : ‘ Dream Century ’ will certainly be realized , Karunanidhi .
Chennai , Nov.15- After inaugurating the 100th farmers ’ market at Pallavaram in the Kanchipuram North district yesterday , Karunanidhi said : -
We do what we say
On the last birth anniversary of Nehru - that is on November 14 last year - the first farmers ’ market was inaugurated at Madurai .
Today , after one year , again on the birth anniversary of Nehru , the 100th farmers ’ market has now been opened .
While inaugurating the first farmers ’ market at Madurai , I said that we say only what we can do .
I said that by next year , 100 farmers ’ markets would be inaugurated .
That has come true now with the opening of this 100th farmers ’ market .
It is happening on Nehru ’ s birth anniversary , an important day for India that is celebrated as Children ’ s Day . When I say Children ’ s Day , I am reminded of one thing .
Vairamuthu ’ s analogy
In a poem about the farmers ’ market , my younger brother Vairamuthu makes reference to vegetables and fruits in the market shops and says they look as though small children are resting .
So I feel that inaugurating the 100th farmers ’ market on the birth anniversary of Pandit Nehru is befitting in all ways .
being the Member of the Parliament representing this constituency is a matter of pride ( loud applause ) .
Benefit to farmers
While speaking on the budget for the year 1999-2000 after presenting it in the Assembly on 3-17-1999 : -
In order to give effect to that announcement , I said the following on 10-25-1999 .
Accordingly , 100 farmers ’ markets have now been opened .
I wish to remind everyone where all these markets were opened over the last year .
I am not bringing this up just to point out the farmers markets that were opened .
Statistics
6 farmers ’ markets in the Madurai district .
4 farmers ’ markets in the Thiruvannamalai district .
3 farmers ’ markets in the Thiruvarur district .
3 farmers ’ markets in the Thanjavur district .
4 farmers ’ markets in the Trichy district .
6 farmers ’ markets in the Salem district .
3 farmers ’ markets in the Dindugal district .
4 farmers ’ markets in the Theni district .
4 farmers ’ markets in the Thirunelveli district .
3 farmers ’ markets in the Villupuram district .

4 farmers ’ markets in the Namakkal district .
3 farmers ’ markets in the Sivagangai district .
2 farmers ’ markets in the Ramanathapuram district .
5 farmers ’ markets in the Virudhunagar district .

2 farmers ’ markets in the Kanniyakumari district .
2 farmers ’ markets in the Nagapattinam district .
2 farmers ’ markets in the Perambalur district .
4 farmers ’ markets in the Erode district .
2 farmers ’ markets in the Nilgiris district : That is to say , a total of 99 farmers ’ markets have been opened so far .
And this is the 100th one .
During the last one year 169,336,963 tons of vegetables have been sold in these 99 farmers ’ markets .
The value of the vegetables sold in these 99 farmers ’ markets is 1,128,535,326 rupees .
I must tell you one thing .
Building worth
110 million rupees
Who are the beneficiaries ?
Brother Veerapandi Arumugam has said it correctly .
Consumers benefit .
So also farmers benefit . This is what he said .
Earlier , whenever our ladies went to buy vegetables , it would take half an hour to bargain before they could buy the vegetables .
Sometimes husbands would be angry with them for taking so much time to buy vegetables .
Cheap
Now that problem does not exist .
When our women go to buy vegetables here , they will find that they are cheap and the prices are fixed . The price of each vegetable is written there .
So women have to go , pay the fixed price , buy , and come back quickly .
There is one other benefit .
Husbands would ask , “ Why are you so late ? ” and wives would respond “ if you went shopping , you would realize , ” and the quarrel would begin there . Now there are no conditions for that .
You should remember that that in itself is a big benefit for families .
Profit of 220
million rupees
I have already mentioned that farmers have sold vegetables worth 1130 million rupees at these farmers ’ markets .
That is to say , they have earned a profit of 227.2 million rupees over and above what they had been earning earlier .
I wish to remind you that in this way , because of farmers ’ markets , the benefit to consumers is 340 million rupees .
That is to say , this business is going well without any middlemen .
Middlemen should not be mistaken for businessmen , traders .
Because this government is friendly to businessmen as well .
The DMK government is the only government that has done a lot for the business community , unlike the previous governments .
Now business people invite us for conferences , not to place demands on us .
But to thank us- to thank us .
It is under these circumstances that the 100th farmers ’ market opens today .
So also it is my ambition , my desire , that there should be 100 villages of harmony in Tamilnadu .
Because of the good work of the minister , Ko . Si . Mani , so far , 81 Periar Memorial
villages of harmony have been opened .
I am confident that the balance of 19 villages of harmony shall be opened by the month of December .
I firmly believe that my dream century of 100 each shall be realized .
Prices fall
No one can contradict the fact that , not only have the prices of vegetables gone down , but the prices overall have also gone down in Tamilnadu as compared to other states .
Bengal gram was sold at 30.76 rupees per kg during the previous rule .
Today it is sold for 25.13 rupees per kg .
Groundnut oil was sold at 41.30 rupees per kg .
Today it is sold for 37.89 rupees per kg .
Sesame oil was sold at 37.89 rupees per kg during the previous rule .
Today it is sold for 37.41 rupees per kg .
Coconut oil was sold at 48.71 rupees per kg during the previous rule .
Today it is sold for 41.20 rupees per kg .
Dry chili was sold at 44.65 rupees per kg during the previous rule .
Today it is sold for 28.89 rupees per kg
Onion ( large ) was sold at 7.70 rupees per kg during the previous rule .
Today it is sold for 6.78 rupees per kg
Village of harmony to end caste system
This aside , you all know the good work and achievements of this government over the last four and a half years .
Under the Anna Renaissance Scheme , 74,810 works have been completed at a cost of 6920 million rupees .
Under the &apos; We , for Ourselves &apos; scheme , 18,590 works have been completed at a cost of 1477.4 million rupees .
Of this , 5142 million rupees is the share of the public .
30,505 works have been completed at a cost of 4149.4 million rupees under MLA &apos;s constituency development fund .
Under the &quot; Preventive Health Check-up Scheme &quot; , with the best efforts of the Health Minister , Arcot Veerasamy , 7,680 health camps were conducted benefiting about 7.6 million poor people .
Under the safety of cattle scheme , 3,389 health camps were conducted benefiting over 8.4 million cattle .
. Even after all this , those who want to find fault keep saying many things .
What is the fault ?
Sugarcane price
They ask , &quot; where is the thousand rupees for sugarcane that you promised that time ? &quot;
The DMK election manifesto nowhere mentioned that we would give a thousand rupees for sugarcane .
Though not mentioned in the election manifesto , it is true that we announced in the election meetings that we would endeavor to give up to 1000 rupees for sugarcane .
We do not deny that .
Now we have come forward to give that and we are giving .
A thousand rupees are given for the sugarcane that has 10 percent recovery .
Ignorance of standard
But some people ask , &quot; why do you give 1000 rupees only for sugarcane with 10 percent recovery ? You should give the same price for the sugarcane with 8 percent recovery also . &quot;
You should yourself think whether it is justifiable .
Could this demand for a thousand rupees for sugarcane with ten percent as well as eight percent recovery be justified ?
If a thousand rupees are paid for sugarcane with eight percent recovery , won &apos;t the one who has sugarcane with ten percent recovery ask for 1200 rupees ?
Those in Kanchipuam district know well about yarn .
Thus he spoke .
130 million bank employees on strike throughout India today
Chennai , Nov. 15 - Bank employees are on a day &apos;s strike today , demanding solutions to many problems including privatization of banks . Nine union leaders
spoke to the press about this yesterday .
Then they said : -
We severely condemn the privatization of banks .
Banks have been functioning for the welfare of the nation .

The national interest will suffer .
Aside from that , 80 million people have deposited their money with the banks .
Farmers cannot get loans easily from these banks .
The interests of bank employees will suffer .
This Privatization Bill should be withdrawn .
If this Bill is introduced in Parliament , we will go on indefinite strike condemning this .
Danger
The nation will be in danger if banks are privatized .
The government should withdraw the voluntary retirement scheme .
This strike is in protest against this as well .
This strike is also against the recommendation to reduce the retirement age from 60 to 58 .
130 million employees from all over India are participating in this one-day strike .
In all , 65 trade unions are participating .

Tomorrow ( today ) we will go to the secretariat and seek Chief Minister Karunanidhi &apos;s support .

If the government turns a deaf ear to our demands , then the agitation will continue indefinitely .
Today we are going on strike . Then we will go in a procession from Rajaji road to the Fort ( secretariat ) and hand over a petition to the Chief Minister . After that we will meet Jayalalitha and ask her to support us .
They said so .
Union Minister

Chief Election Commissioner in Pondicherry : New voters list to be released on January 2nd , MS Gill tells the press .
Pondicherry , Nov. 15- Chief Election Commissioner of India MS Gill
inspected the revision of the voters list at Pondicherry on the 11th and at Karaikkal on the 12th .
He came to Pondicherry yesterday morning .
He took part in the consultation held by the electoral officers held at the seminar hall of the Pondicherry secretariat .
Then while speaking to reporters , he said :
I personally inspected the election works at Pondicherry and Karaikkal .
Works are going on well .
This being a small state , we could integrate everything and do well .
Steps are being taken to delete the names of dead persons from the voters list .
The revised voters list will be released on January 2nd .
Computerization
The voters list is being computerized all over the country .
The names of 622 million voters
in India are being entered into the master system .
Even in USA this has not been done .
The voters list has also been published in book form .
The name of the voter , father ’ s name , photograph and ID number are all mentioned in it .
Bogus voting can also be prevented by this .
85 percent of people have been issued voter identity cards in Pondicherry .
Steps are being taken to issue photo identity cards to those whose names have been left out and also for new voters .
Electronic voting machines will be used in Pondicherry in the forthcoming election as well .
As Tamilnadu and Pondicherry are close by , there are more chances of bogus voting .
This could be prevented by permitting voters after proper verification .
The public should be prepared for this .
The number of voters in different constituencies differs widely throughout India .
A law should be enacted by Parliament as provided by the Constitution to remove this imbalance .
Discussion is going on to persuade the governments and the political parties .
Steps are being taken to conduct the coming election in a fair manner with enough protection .
He said so .
Chief Electoral Officer Vijayan , Deputy Chief Election Commissioner Arunachalam and Senior Superintendent of Police Anand Mohan were with him .

No final decision on privatization of Salem steel plant yet made , says union minister Tripati .
Chennai . Nov , 15-
The union minister of state for steel , Tripati , met the press and spoke to people from the media yesterday .
He said : -
India is producing 60 percent steel ( iron ) domestically .
Of this , only 35 percent is produced by the government .
Fewer people use steel in India .
Studies reveal that individual consumption of steel is at only 24 percent .
Special camps are being organized in villages with a goal of increasing steel consumption .
Even in building construction , steel is used only up to 9 percent in India .
But in foreign countries , 40 percent steel is used in building construction .
New policy
A consultation is ongoing to decide whether to introduce a special course on the importance of steel in the curriculum of engineering colleges and universities .
Such a step may lead to increased use of steel by people in their day-to-day activities .
During the last 5 years , 60,000 employees in the steel sector have sought voluntary retirement .
An amount of 1,00,000 million rupees has been allocated for them .
We are planning to implement a national steel policy with a goal of increasing steel production in the country .
10 percent increase
A separate committee has been set up for this plan .
This committee will submit its report in 3 months .
Then that report will be submitted to Parliament .
Later , public opinion will also be ascertained and then it will be passed by Parliament in the shape of a bill .
Steel production has gone up by 10 percent in the last 6 months .
Final decision
Salem steel plant is a good company
But now it has incurred a loss of 5510 million rupees .
If the government has to run this plant again , then it would need 8000 million rupees to meet the losses and interest due so far .
Now 13 private companies have come forward to invest in the Salem steel plant .
The central government is holding talks with these private companies .
No final decision has yet been made on privatizing the Salem steel plant .
This is what he said .

Go in front of the Elephants .
If they chase , you run .
If you cannot run , raise your hands up and stop .
Come what may , just stand there .
I used to think a lot about my fans while I was in the jungle .
I used to doubt whether I would be able to see my fans again at all .
Veerappan ’ s gang had just one radio .
That was the only solace that I had .
I used to wait for the news .
God ’ s grace
By God ’ s grace , we were released .
We did not imagine that we would be released so soon .
We were released suddenly .
Even today it seems like a dream .

A petition was submitted in the Supreme Court against this .
The bench , comprised of Justice K. T. Thomas and
P. C. Sethi , delivered the judgment yesterday :
Investigations have not yet begun in this case .
A delay in investigation cannot be a reason to keep a person in prison indefinitely and this is not acceptable .
The fact that the investigation has not yet begun is highly condemnable .
We cannot allow a person to be detained in jail for such a long time without an investigation .
Vaiko condemns Sri Lankan Navy ’ s attack on Tamilnadu fishermen
Chennai , Nov. 30-
Text of Vaiko ’ s speech in the House of People :
Compensation
Congress made the biggest blunder by giving Kachatheevu Island to Sri Lanka .
Even though the Tamilnadu fishermen have traditional fishing rights , the very sea where they go to fish unfortunately becomes their grave . This is really terrible .
It is a great insult to a great nation like India that tiny Sri Lanka , with its small navy , is attacking and killing our fishermen .
It is the duty of the Indian government to safeguard the life of every citizen .
The Indian government should immediately warn the Sri Lankan government to stop attacking our fishermen .
The affected fishermen and their families must be compensated for their loss .
The life of a fishermen is a major struggle in itself .
They venture into the sea to fish , unmindful of the danger to their lives from storms , etc .
They support their families only with what they earn from it .
The central government should take action .
The life of a fishermen is full of struggle and misery .
Under these circumstances , the fact that foreigners kill our fishermen in our own sea is deplorable .
I demand that the central government severely condemn the Sri Lankan government and take steps to protect Tamilnadu fishermen .
This is what he said .

Nadar Youth association general secretary Arivanandha Pandian dies in car accident .
Trichy , Nov. 30-
Arivanandha Pandian ( aged 40 ) belongs to Madurai .
He was the general secretary of the All India Nadar Youth Association .
He used to go to Chennai and other districts in connection with his union work .
A conference was held the day before yesterday in Chennai for enrolling members in the India Nadar Association .
Traveled by car
After attending the meeting , Arivanandha Pandian left Chennai in his Tata Safari car two nights ago .
Union member Shanmugakani ( age 55 ) and police constable Murugesan ( age 35 ) of the armed reserve police also accompanied Arivanandha Pandian .
The car was driven by driver Dharmar ( age 35 ) .
Collides with a truck
Around 2 : 30 am , as the car approached
Valpattarai near Sirukannur on the Trichy-Chennai main road , it collided with a truck that was parked there for repairs . After colliding with the truck , the car rolled a few times and landed upside down .
The driver of the car and Arivanandha Pandian died on the spot .
Shanmugakani and Murugesan are fighting for their lives with severe injuries .
Both were admitted to a private hospital in Trichy for treatment .
They are being treated there .
S. P visits them
Siruganur police inspector Selva Prakasam and sub-inspector Marimuthu have registered the case and are investigating .
On hearing about the accident , Trichy district superintendent of police Jayant Murali visited the scene of the accident .
It is known that the truck , which was parked for repairs , was going from Madurai to Chennai .
Important person
Arivanandha Pandian is a well known personality not only in Madurai , but also in the entire Tamilnadu among the Nadar community .
Currently he was also the organizer of the All India Nadar Association .
As he was receiving threats , he had police protection even on travel .
Wife and Family
Arivanandan belongs to Kommadi Kottai in the Tuticorin District .
But his family has been doing a wholesale shipping business in Madurai for a long time .
Arivanandan ’ s wife is Malathy ( age 35 ) .
He has two sons , Aswin Pandian ( age 17 ) and Avinash Pandian ( age 10 ) .

Hand that rocked the cradle shall rule the world : Minister Duraimurugan .
Palani , Nov. 30-
Minister Durai Murugan today inaugurated the computer center implemented at a cost of Rs .
400,000 at the Palani Government Girls Higher Secondary School under the MLA constituency fund and spoke at the occasion :
The use of computers has increased these days .
A time will come when nothing will be possible without computers .
Previously , there were two categories of people : the working class and the educated .
Educated people were the ones who studied Tamil .
Later , only those who studied English were thought to be educated .
Today , only a computer literate person is known as educated .
Today , everything in the world is computerized .
Replying through the computer
Yesterday , the health minister spoke at a conference held in Chennai .
Those who were seeing it live from America asked questions directly from there .
And the minister replied to their queries .
Computer technology has grown so much , and the world seems so small now .
I had been to a school .
Boys in English courses of instruction were dressed up in coats and ties .
Boys in Tamil courses of instruction were in standard attire .
I told them :
Young minds will be adversely affected by seeing the boys with ties .
So change this system .
That is why our leader , Kalaingnar , has ordered that every school , be it in the city or in a village , provide computer education .
Job opportunities
Even if a student gets 100 % marks in higher secondary , he will not get a job if he does not have computer skills .
There should only be one system of education in villages and in cities .
Results show that suburban school students fare better than their counterparts in cities .
In particular , girls fare better .
Reservation
In the next 10 to 20 years , women ’ s lot will improve by leaps and bounds .
Due to the reservation of 36 % of the seats in local body elections for women , around 44,000 women are members of corporations , municipalities , and village governing bodies .
Similarly , if 36 % of spaces are reserved for women in state assemblies and parliament , there will be women everywhere .
The hand that rocks the cradle shall rule the world .
To cite an example , all our men came back empty-handed .
It was only the Andhra girl who received a medal and saved India ’ s honor .
Epic stories
Gone are the days when women used to be tied up with kitchen chores . They are flying aircrafts now .
Women have shown their talent .
Emissary
Let us take emissaries . The protector of the universe , Lord Krishna , went as an emissary of Pandavas to Dhuriyodhan , but returned empty-handed without getting even 5 houses .
In epic Ramayana also , Anjaneya and his brother Angathan went as emissaries to Ravanan and returned empty-handed .
In Kandha Puranam , Veerapaagu came back empty-handed after meeting Soorapadman .
The epics talk very highly of these three emissaries .
But it is a fact that all men who were sent as emissaries came back empty-handed .
But the great saint , Tiruvalluvar , has written a chapter on emissaries .
In it he talks about how an emissary should speak out .
Adhiyaman
Avvai ( a poetess ) was the one who performed the duties of an emissary as expounded by Tiruvalluvar .
Kings Adhiyaman and Thondaiman were about to wage war against each other .
Avvai went as Adhiyaman ’ s emissary and spoke to Thondaiman .
Thondaiman took Avvai to his armory and showed her the shiny spears and arrows and asked for her opinion .
Avvai said that it was no doubt that all of the weapons were shiny .
Because you have never used them .
But the spears and arrows in Adhiyaman ’ s armory look dull , without any shine .
Because he has been fighting war after war and has won every one of them . That is why his weapons look dull
Immediately Thondaiman realized that he would not be able to defeat Adhiyaman , who had seen many a battlefield . So he asked Avvai for a peace negotiation and they both avoided war .
Women shall rule .
I say this because , right from the role of emissary , women will prove better than men in any field .
In the next 25 years , women will be everywhere .
You will realize this in 25 years .
You will realize that Durai Murugan said so in Madurai 25 years ago and that it has become true .

but also for the forestry .

STF search : Krishnaswamy opposes . Says negotiations should take place between government and Veerappan .
Chennai , Nov. 30
Dr. Krishnaswamy spoke to the press yesterday : -
The rescue team did a humanitarian job rescuing actor Rajkumar .
This should be appreciated .
Jayalalitha ’ s request for a CBI enquiry is unnecessary . No one should look for political mileage here .
There is no need for STF to search Veerappan .
Veerappan ’ s demands need to be considered .
We can send Rajkumar himself to negotiate with Veerappan .
Since he has been with Veerappan for 3 months , he would know Veerappan ’ s feelings .
We can negotiate with Veerappan through Rajkumar and bring Veerappan to the right path .
Veerappan can be given amnesty .

Horror at Adambakkam : Illicit love affair : sister-in-law – brother hacked to death , youth acts in frenzy
Alanthur , Nov. 30-
Maritin hails from Kuthankuzhi in the Nellai District
He lived in a rental house at Santhi Nagar in Adambakkam with his wife Prema ( age 30 ) and daughters , Manjothi ( age 9 ) and Catherine ( age 6 ) .
Martin , who worked as a medical representative , used to often travel officially to Mumbai .
Tea business
So he brought his brother Dominic ( age 29 ) from his native area to stay with them to help his wife and children .
Later , both Martin and Dominic
began a tea business together .
His paternal uncle ’ s son , John ( age 27 ) , was sending a lot of money from Kuwait for this business .
The business was going well .
Love affair
After some time , John came to Mumbai from Kuwait .
While staying there , he kept sending money for the tea business .
Martin told John that it would be better for business if he could come to Chennai and stay there .
So John came to Adambakkam and got into the business with Martin and Dominic .
Martin ’ s wife Prema cast an eye on John , who on his return from Kuwait was spending a lot of money living a luxurious life , in addition to giving money to Martin whenever he asked for it .
She thought that she could become rich by trapping John .
So she began flirting with John .
John , who fell into the trap , began staying with his brother ’ s wife whenever his brother was out .
Since he thought that Dominic was a nuisance to have around , he would give him tea packets and ask him to go out and sell them and also tell him to get new orders .
But he would stay back at the house .
Suspicion
These activities made Dominic suspicious .
He used to pretend to go out , but would return home to find out what was happening in the house .
Seeing his sister in-law , Prema , and John together in a compromising position , he would become infuriated .
He tried to put an end to this relationship
But as time passed , it became worse .
It was normal that at night , Prema would sleep in a room with her daughters and Dominic and John would sleep in another room .
Two nights ago , Dominic was shocked to not find John in the bed .
When he went and knocked on the door of his sister-in-law Prema ’ s room , John came out of it .
Threat
The next morning , while Prema was making tea in the kitchen , Dominic went and warned her to tell him what had happened the previous night .
“ Is it right on your part ?
You are deceiving my brother .
I will not let you go off , ” he threatened .
But Prema was not bothered at all and asked him to mind his own business .
“ Do not interfere in this matter , ” she told him .
Hacked to death
Dominic was infuriated by the thought that his sister-in-law Prema would not correct herself .
Deciding that letting her off this way was wrong , he picked up the sickle lying there and struck at her neck from behind .
Then Prema screamed in pain and fell down .
Immediately , John , who was sleeping in the adjacent room , came running .
Dominic , who was in a murderous frenzy , struck at John with the sickle , saying , “ You are the root cause of all this . ”
Then John fell down .
Noticing Prema struggling for life in the kitchen , Dominic muffled her with a pillow .
Surrender
Inspector Thangeswaran informed the higher police officials of this .
On the order of Superintendent of Police Balasubramanian , Deputy Superintendent of Police Gnanamani , Inspector Thangeswaran , Sub-Inspector Haridas , and other police personnel rushed to the murder scene .
Dead body recovered
John was lying in a room with his neck split open .
In the kitchen lay the body of Martin ’ s wife , Prema , with her neck hacked .
The room was splattered with blood
A sickle lay close , dripping with blood .
Police sent both dead bodies to the Chrompet Hospital for a postmortem .
Martin arrives
On hearing about the incident , Martin flew to Chennai from Mumbai .
Martin , who went home , entered the owner ’ s room without even seeing the dead bodies of his wife or his cousin that lay in his house , and there he fainted .
When he regained consciousness after half an hour , he saw both his daughters , Manjothi and Catherine , in tears and cried holding them .
This moved the onlooker to tears .
Sensational speech at Election Commission ’ s golden jubilee celebrations : do not allow criminals inside assembly , warns President Narayanan
New Delhi , Jan. 18 – The golden jubilee celebrations of the Election Commission were held yesterday in Delhi . President K.
R.
Narayanan , who inaugurated the function , said :
The Election Commission has mentioned that some 500 to 800 representatives selected in elections in our country have criminal backgrounds .
Financial power , muscle power , and mafia gangs play important roles in the elections .
That is why electoral reforms are needed .
The Election Commission says that amendments should be made to the Representation of People Act .
The Election Commission said that this would prevent bad elements from running in parliamentary and assembly elections .
But creating a new law is not enough to tackle this issue .
Criminals should not be allowed .
Criminals , even convicted ones , are able to run in the elections .
They somehow manage to enter the assembly and parliament .
This trend worries me .
You can ’ t run a government when criminals have entered the assembly .
Such a government would end up a laughing stock .
Therefore , political parties , at least starting in the coming elections , should deny tickets for candidates with criminal backgrounds .
If political parties reject people with criminal backgrounds and prevent them from running in elections , we can oust criminals from politics .
This is what is most expected of political parties .
Reservations for women
Women should be given reserved seats in the assembly and parliament .
The Election Commission has a lot of responsibilities .
Therefore , political parties should give enough seats to women .
Irregularities can be eradicated in elections if political parties extend cooperation .
The Election Commission has successfully held 13 general elections in the last 50 years .
It has conducted assembly elections in many states , which is a remarkable achievement .
These elections have been conducted efficiently and in an unbiased manner ,
he said .
The modern Agni-2 missile a success , can attack targets 2000 km away
Balasore , Jan. 18-
The Agni is one of India ’ s medium-range missiles .
India already tested the Agni-2 category missile on April 11 , 1999 .
Indian scientists further upgraded that missile and tested it yesterday .
This Agni-2 missile test was conducted successfully in Orissa yesterday .
Flies out like an arrow
This test was conducted at Wheeler Island , 80 km from the Balasore Test Range in Orissa . Officers monitored the test from ships that were waiting in the Bay of Bengal and coastal centers .
The missile was fired at
10 : 11 am .
It flew fiercely like an arrow toward a specified target .
praised the scientists involved in the project .
Agni-2 Missile Program Director R. N. Agarwal said that the test was a complete success . The Indian government had already informed Pakistan about the missile test .
According to a mutual agreement between India and Pakistan , one country should notify the other in advance before conducting a missile test .
Following this agreement , the Indian government formally informed the Pakistani
government about the missile test .
Modern missile
The successfully test-fired Agni-2 missile is a surface-to-surface missile .
It weighs 16 tons and
can attack enemy targets about 2000 km away . It is 21 meters high and has a diameter of 1.3 meters . This missile , which consists of two parts , runs on solid fuel .
Nuclear bomb
The Agni-2 can carry nuclear warheads .
This missile can carry about a 1-ton payload .
The missile can be moved to the desired location by train on a broad-gauge railway track to be fired .
Test-firing this missile was delayed due to U.S. objections to the project .
Officials have revealed that if it weren ’ t for those objections , the Agni-2 missile test would have been conducted a long time ago .
Threat to Pakistan
Pakistan has accused India , saying that the Indian Agni-2 missile is a threat to Pakistan .
The spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Affairs Ministry said that India ’ s policy on nuclear weapons and its missile program could be a great threat to Pakistan .

Successive earthquake nature ’ s ‘ signal : ’ a massive quake to attack Nellai , shocking information from experts
Thirunelveli , Jan. 18 -
Our people were of the opinion that earthquakes were a North Indian phenomenon . But an incident that happened in 1998 in Thirunelveli has caused mild panic among them .
Electric post buried
The Nellai people were stunned when an electric pole in Abhishekapatti near the Manonmaniyam Sundaranar University suddenly melted and sank into the ground .
Just imagine an electric pole that was upright just a little while before all of a sudden disappearing .
The government , in order to allay panic in the public , said that the pole had melted due to a power leakage .
We have heard that a power leakage could at worst cause power outages and burn some wires .
But when an electric pole melted and sank into the ground , people were not convinced .
Earthquake
At this point , an earthquake was felt in the Nellai and Tuticorin districts on 12-12-2000 and 1-7-2000 .
A baby was killed when a wall collapsed in Kadaiyam in Nellai from the impact of the quake .
But the government announced that the wall did not collapse
from the earthquake , but because of incessant rains and that was why the wall collapsed and killed the baby .
People in the Nellai and Tuticorin districts panicked after successive quakes were felt within a month ’ s time .
They want to be educated on safety measures to escape from the quake ,
or at least that they should be informed about the real situation .
But a quake measuring only 4.8
on the Richter scale has been recorded .
The government had announced that it was not dangerous .
But it could be a warning sign of a larger quake , say geologists .
The structure of the land
The Nellai district is a rocky region .
This aside , it is also a region that is densely surrounded by the mountains of the Western Ghats , which are thousands of years old .
It was only due to these factors that
the size of the quake was limited to 4.8 on the Richter scale .
If this quake had taken place in a North Indian state , it would have been catastrophic .
Speaking about this , Professor G. Manimaran of V.O.C. College
in Tuticorin , said :
This quake is similar to a warning before a storm .
Successive earthquakes within a short period are undoubtedly a sign of danger .
There ’ s a chance of a massive earthquake in the future .
If that quake measured 5 or 6 on the Richter scale , it would destroy Nellai , he said .
Tremors were felt not only in Nellai and Tuticorin , but also in Coimbatore and Kerala .
The tremors were more acutely felt in Pathanamthitta , Idukki , Kollam , Kottayam , Ernakulam , and Sabarimalai in Kerala .
The government can only take precautionary measures , even for ordinary floods .
And what could the government do in the event of a sudden earthquake ?
This is a fair question .
We can ’ t avoid such natural events .
But Nature doesn ’ t fail to give us signs of earthquakes .
The melting of an electric pole in Abhishekapatti two years ago is evidence , says Professor Sivasubramaniam .
He continued to explain that the real reason that the electric pole sank was magma ,
which was confirmed in a test .
When the melting place was dug up , it went down like a tunnel , more than 20 feet deep .
We couldn ’ t continue digging after a certain point .
I found molten rock there .
We took samples of the magma from three places and sent them to the Geological Survey , Mangalore , and the Lightning Research Center in Florida ( U.S. ) .
The U.S. told us that the rock didn ’ t melt because of lightning .
At the same time , we were stunned by the rock analysis report from Mangalore .
Earthquake symptom
There is a chemical called silica in the rock from the region . It usually represents 99 percent .
But according to the report , the rock contained 50 percent silica , and the other 50 percent was made up of substances like calcium , magnesium , nickel , and chromium .
This proves beyond a doubt that it came from the earth .
It was molten rock , called magma , that erupted in that location .
We found out then that it was a sign of an earthquake .
But the government had told us that it was magma .
But geological researchers from the Nellai district say that it was actually lava .
Threat of mass destruction
But researchers say that the reason for the recent earthquake is somewhat different .
Can you believe that India itself is moving northward 2 centimeters a year ?
But that ’ s the truth .
Such quakes happen because pressure caused by the collision of the tectonic plates of the Indian subcontinent against the back of Asia falls on southern Tamilnadu and Kerala , which form the tail portion .
Researchers also consider the substantial drop in groundwater levels in the Nellai region to be one of the reasons for the quake .
Another important thing that frightens them is the Koodangulam Atomic Power Station project .
The site where the Koodangulam Atomic Power Station is going to be built is located in a dry , rocky region .
Therefore , even minor tremors cause a threat of radiation .
Moreover , traces of the volcanic eruptions that took place here more than one million years ago can still be seen in this place .
The heavy loss of lives and property and the adverse effects of radiation after the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 are well known .
But if such a dangerous incident takes place in Koodankulam from an earthquake , a 140 km-square area would be completely devastated , say scientists .
How to escape
Creatures such as birds , rats , frogs , and snakes sense earthquakes about 5 hours before they occur and become restless .
The only way to save ourselves is to watch them and rush out to open spaces .
But earthquakes strike mostly in the early morning .
It is indeed 90 percent impossible to escape at that time .
Handle cases with iron fist , no mercy on persons charged with corruption : Supreme Court ’ s order to lower courts
Iron fist
All courts should handle corruption cases related to government employees sentenced under anti-corruption laws with an iron fist and determination .
Corruption , after it is proven , should not be rejected , regardless of the person , level , or dimension involved .
There is no need to show mercy to people sentenced in these proven cases .
They are different from ordinary criminal cases .
These cases should not be handled with compassion or lenience ,
says the judgment .
The Supreme Court delivered this important judgment in a case relating to
the release from jail on the grounds of good conduct of a man convicted of corruption .
The government should keep its expenditures transparent : speaker Balayogi at the conference of chairmen of Public Accounts Committees .
New Delhi , Jan. 18 -
The two-day conference of chairmen of Public Accounts Committees of Lok Sabha and state assemblies began yesterday in Delhi . Lok Sabha Speaker Balayogi inaugurated the event and spoke at the occasion :
We should spend the taxpayers ’ money with prudence .
We should give people the opportunity to know the details of the government ’ s expenditures .
Therefore government employees , including senior IAS officers , must perform their duties with sincerity and commitment .
Inflated budget
Incorrect budget assessment
Ministries make incorrect calculations to get more funds .
It is due to mess-ups like this that some important departments don ’ t get enough funds .
Monitoring
What does the Public Accounts Committee ’ s report often encourage ?
It encourages ministers to put concerned officials on the task of monitoring expenses ,
said Speaker Balayogi .
N.D. Tiwari
N.D. Tiwari , Lok Sabha Public Accounts Committee chairman , said ministers returned huge amounts of money unused because of incorrect assessments when preparing their budgets .
Indian Army not inferior to Chinese in any way : General Padmanabhan is proud
New Delhi , Jan. 18 -
Chief of Army Staff General Padmanabhan gave an exclusive interview to a private television channel in Tamilnadu .
During this , he explained many issues such as the ceasefire in Kashmir , its consequences , the use of the army in domestic affairs , and the military strength of India and China .
He said :
The Kashmir ceasefire announced by the central government has yielded good results .
This should continue .
The army should be used only as a last resort to crush domestic terrorism .
Problems could be solved through talks in all areas and under any circumstances .
There is a scope for that .
There is nothing that can ’ t be solved through discussions .
Equal strength
The Indian Army is on the same level as the Chinese army in strength .
There is no difference between the two in weapons power .
They have more when it comes to head count .
They have more soldiers than us .
Their armored corps is not as strong as ours , and we are going to get T90 battle
tanks in the near future .
Aside from us , only the U.S. has this type of tank .
As far as artillery is concerned , ours is twice as strong as theirs .
Our air force is strong than theirs .
Not many Tamils
Youths have not lost interest in joining the army . But the number of Tamils in the army is decreasing .
This is regrettable ,
he said .

the latter .
He had gone underground for more than a month .
Surrender

Hearing begins in court : Ramar Pillai not a scientist , but an amateur , IIT scientist Ganesan testifies
including Ramar Pillai ’ s foster mother , had appeared in court .
Scientist testifies
IIT scientist Ganesan testified in this case as the first witness . He said :
I am a mechanical engineer .
I have a Ph.D. and I ’ ve been working for 30 years
at IIT .
I ’ ve been offering advice on mechanical matters to 20 private and government organizations .
One Arun introduced Ramar Pillai to me in April 1995 .
He gave me a liquid and asked me if I could test it and find out if an
engine could be run using it .
Experiment
I immediately told him that he should
formally inform the IIT and test it .
Therefore they formally gave a letter to
me and also to IIT .
First Ramar Pillai demonstrated in my house as to how he would produce the herbal gasoline .
He had brought a vessel for the purpose .
He asked me only for some hot water .
I gave him hot water .
Then he put certain things , allegedly herbs , into the vessel .
He also added a catalyst .
Then he closed the vessel and opened it after a little while .
He then removed the liquid that was floating on the hot water .
When it was lit , it burned well .
It smelled of kerosene .
When we tried to run an engine on it , the engine worked .
Therefore , an engine can run on it .
But I told them that I wasn ’ t sure about the consequences .
I don ’ t know what ingredients he put in the vessel .
I gave a report because the engine worked .
But I didn ’ t give a certificate .
Ten scientists
and the glass stick we gave to stir the hot water for preparing herbal gasoline . He put certain things in the hot water and stirred it for about 45 minutes .
Then he kept it closed for some time before opening it .
But nothing happened .
Not gasoline
Then Ramar Pillai sought permission to use the stick he brought with him .
So we weighed the stick he had brought .
It weighed 170.88
grams .
He stirred the hot water with that stick for some 5 to 6 minutes .
Then it smelled like kerosene .
We immediately took the stick from Ramar Pillai and weighed it .
The weight of the stick had decreased to 142.2
grams .
Therefore we realized that some sort of liquid was leaking from the stick that Ramar Pillai used and that it was the liquid that released the kerosene smell .
In order to confirm this , we asked him to test it once again .
But Ramar Pillai said he hadn ’ t brought enough herbs for another test .
His statement surprised us .
He wasn ’ t able to prove that he could produce herbal gasoline .
This led us to conclude that what Ramar Pillai prepared was neither herbal gasoline ,
nor any kind of herbal fuel ,
he testified .
An amateur
Then Sampath Kumar , Ramar Pillai ’ s lawyer , cross-examined scientist Ganesan .
When defense counsel Ragunathan , appearing for defendant Bharat , interrogated scientist Ganesan , he asked him how he would know that Ramar Pillai was
not a scientist .
Answering this , scientist Ganesan said that Ramar Pillai was not a scientist
and that he knew that he was an amateur .
This is what he testified .
Adjourned
Then Magistrate Krishnamurthy adjourned the hearing until the 6th of next month .
Advocate Sounderarajan appeared on behalf of the CBI .
135 people have been cited as witnesses in this case .
18 Tamil boys who were in misery for 3 years in Karnataka rescued , plea to the government to rescue children who are engaged as bonded laborers
Chennai , Jan. 18 -
Some periodicals carried stories about boys from Tamilnadu living in misery in Karnataka as bonded laborers .
Following this , a group of activists led by Mani , convener of the Chennai – Chengalpattu districts ’ committee for the People ’ s Union for Civil Liberties , went to Karnataka .
They met the collector for the Shimoga district with members of the movement against child labor .
They asked him to rescue the boys from Tamilnadu who were living in Karnataka as bonded laborers .
3 years
The Shimoga district collector consulted his fellow officers on this .
Following this , 18 boys , including Murugesh and Ragupathi , who were living as bonded laborers in the Kolur fishermen ’ s colony in Hasi Maruki in Karnataka were rescued .
All of them had been living as bonded laborers for periods ranging from 1 to 3 years .
Later , 5 more boys who worked as bonded laborers were also rescued in a hunt .
Plea to government
The convener for the People ’ s Union for Civil Liberties , Mani , spoke to news people in Chennai . He said :
The Karnataka Police sent policemen to hunt down the agents who sent children from Tamilnadu .
So far , the Tamilnadu government has not offered to rehabilitate the Tamil children who were living as bonded laborers so far .
According to a report , there are 25,000 children from Tamilnadu who live as bonded laborers .
The government should offer to rescue at least 10,000 of them ,
he said .
Periyar dam issue : protest group announces contempt of court case against Kerala government in Supreme Court
Theni , Jan. 18 -
The statement by S. Rathinasamy , organizer of the Periyar dam protest group is as follows :
The Kerala Assembly Committee , led by P.C. George , MLA , inspected the Periyar dam 3 days ago and
Nayanar has been consistently following the Goebbels ’ technique of repeating a lie to make it seem true .
An expert from the Tuticorin Geology Department , Dr. N. Ramanujam , and the advisor to the State Water Resources Department , A. Mohanakrishnan ,
have asserted that the Periyar dam was not at all affected by the quake . We regret that all of this has fallen on Nayanar ’ s deaf ears .
Renovation of the dam
Tamilnadu government
has also completed the last phase of its work following the agreement to renovate the dam at the cost of Rs . 150 million .
Why did the Kerala government suddenly start wailing that the dam would break if water was stored and creating panic among the people of Kerala after the renovation was completed ?
If political parties in Kerala wanted to allay the fears of the people of Kerala , they should campaign for it . But why are they creating a psychosis of fear and trying to capitalize on it ?
Mohan MP
The Supreme Court has given Kerala a 6-week period to respond to the report from the Brar and Mittal team on the Periyar dam issue .
But the Kerala government is attempting to get the deadline extended through an appeal for a technical study of the Periyar dam through its lawyer , Rajiv Dhawan . It has been plotting to let the time slip away .
Contempt of court case
This action is an insult to the Supreme Court .
We would like to warn that if the Kerala government failed to use the 6-month ( Tamil version ) period of time given to it , we would file a petition for contempt of the Supreme Court against the Kerala government on behalf of the Periyar dam protest group ,
he said in his statement .

Makara jothi ends in Sabarimala , 100,000 Ayappa devotees worship at Rameswaram temple , cram in buses , cars , and vans
Rameswaram , Jan. 18 – The number of devotees going to Sabarimalai is increasing every year . This year
on Pongal , about 5 million devotees gathered in Sabharimala and had darshan of Makara jothi .
Devotees returning after darshan go on pilgrimages to many temple cities in Tamilnadu .
More than 100,000 Ayappa devotees came to the famous Ramanadhaswamy temple in Rameswaram yesterday .
Ayappa devotees from Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , Kerala , and various places in Tamilnadu came to Rameswaram in thousands of cars , vans , and buses .
Traffic affected
Buses and trucks were parked at the Rameswaram bus stop and on both sides of the national highway between Thangachimadam and Rameswaram .
Therefore , entering or leaving Rameswaram took about 6 hours .
Vehicles began coming to Rameswaram starting early Tuesday morning and continued coming even after Wednesday ( yesterday ) evening .
Because of this , town buses did not go to the temple but stopped in front of the town panchayat office .
100,000 devotees who came in these vehicles began having darshan at Sri Ramanathaswamy temple starting in the early morning .
They waited in a long line to bathe in the 22 thirthams ( springs ) inside the temple .
Lack of facilities
As there were not enough toilet facilities for the Ayappa devotees who had come to Rameswaram in such huge numbers in a single day , they used the areas around bus stops , the beach , and the roadside to relieve themselves and made them all dirty .
Local police together with traffic police led by DSP Jayabalan , under the order of District Superintendent of Police S.N. Seshasayee , provided security for the protection of the devotees who had come to Rameswaram .
Drinking water needed
The deputy commissioner of the temple , K. Pakkirisamy , and temple officials had provided the necessary amenities to the devotees who had come to the temple .
President of the town panchayat , Archunan , and executive officer Murugesan had arranged to provide drinking water in public taps for a long time to meet the needs of the devotees .
The town panchayat staff , led by sanitation officer Subramanian , was engaged in sanitation work .
Even educated are superstitious : lawyer wanted adjournment on account of rahu kalam ( inauspicious time ) , says justice Mohan
Chennai , Jan. 18- Sathyaraj and Roja starred in Puratchikkaran ( Revolutionary ) . Velu Prabhakaran directed the film and played an important role . A celebration was held for Velu Prabhakaran by the Mathi Arts

the following at the function :
I congratulate and appreciate anyone who delivers messages to reform this rotten
society .
Velu Prabhakaran has conveyed such a message in Puratchikkaran .
The only leader
There ’ s a similarity between him and I.
We have the same point of view , and that ’ s the similarity .
He has dealt with the message of reform that Periyar talked about .
Periyar is the only leader I have seen in my life .
In our country , even educated people have lots of superstitions .
Once I was hearing a case .
The lawyer who appeared in the case asked me to adjourn the case , as it was then rahu kalam .
I asked him what he would do if I didn ’ t adjourn the hearing .
He then told me that he had left home at an auspicious time .
Therefore it wouldn ’ t matter much if I didn ’ t adjourn .
I was agonized that even educated people are superstitious .
Ignorant of revolutions
Velu Prabhakaran has called his film Puratchikkaran ( Revolutionary ) .
He could have named it Pudhumaikkaran &#91; Lover of the new &#93; .
Because nowadays even people who have no clue about revolution talk about it ,
he said .

Actor playing the role of Father Staines burns to death on stage
Mohan Kumar
Chennai , Jan. 17
This incident happened in Chennai .
Father Staines was murdered 2 years ago on January 22nd .
Eight social service organizations conducted a show at Nanganallur in Chennai on the eve of the anniversary of his death .
There was a play on Graham Staines on the 7th . Mohan Kumar , a 26-year-old young man , played the role of Father Staines .
Body burns
He had smeared some gasoline on his body to make the burning realistic .
Then it was time for the scene in which the one in the attire of the father is set on fire .
As Mohan Kumar was set on fire , his whole body went up in flames .
Mohan Kumar screamed .
About 1000 people were watching the play at that time .
But they all thought that Mohan Kumar was performing a daring stunt .
They enjoyed what they thought was great acting .
Only when the curtain was lowered at the end of the scene did the drama troupe realized what had happened .
They were shocked to find Mohan Kumar really charred because of the gasoline he smeared on his body .
Death
They rushed him to a private hospital . The people at the hospital sent them back , advising them to take him to a government hospital , as he was more than 20 %
burned .
Mohan Kumar died 5 days later despite the intensive care at the Kilpauk government hospital and the Royapettah hospital .
Sensational information has been revealed about the incident , wherein the man playing the role of Staines was charred to death .
The drama troupe said :
Nobody knew that Mohan Kumar was actually going to smear gasoline on his body to act in that scene .
We never imagined that he would smear gasoline on his body and act .
He made that decision on his own .
Not even those who acted with him knew about this ,
said Lakshmi Nagar People ’ s Welfare Association secretary , Rama Rao .
On hearing the screams of Mohan Kumar , who was playing the role of Staines , we even poured water on him on the stage .
In spite of that , his body suffered a lot of burns , the play ’ s organizers said .
Sai , who directed the play , was a friend of Mohan Kumar .
He said :
Mohan was always careless .
He would do dangerous things .
I was the one who was meant to play the role of Staines .
But he offered to play it .
It ’ s bad that he didn ’ t tell me a word about his plan to smear gasoline on his body and perform ,
he said .
Mohan Kumar , who died a tragic death , is an electrical and plumbing worker .
Mohan Kumar ’ s mother died when he was 3 .
Since then Mohan Kumar has been living like a member of the Sai family .
The Sai family is deeply distressed about Mohan Kumar ’ s death .

An Hour Long Discussion with the Prime Minister : Mamata &apos;s Strong Objection to Vajpayee ; Railway Fare Shouldn &apos;t Be Hiked .
New Delhi , February 15 - Mamata Banerjee had an hour long discussion with Prime Minister Vajpayee on the railway budget . She appeared to be strongly opposed to the proposed hike of the railway fare .
The budget session of the parliament commences next week .
The union budget and the railway budget are to be presented during the session .
Vajpayee has already indicated that both the general and the railway budgets would be harsh , in order to cope with the financial burden forced on the government due to the Gujarat earthquake .
So , it is expected that both railway fares and freight charges would be hiked .
The Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee holds talks with the leaders of various parties and the officials regarding the railway budget .
When she held discussions with the representatives of all political parties last Friday , it was suggested that the rail fares should not be hiked and the budget should favour the common man .
Meanwhile , Mamata opposed the idea of the Finance Ministry that the railway fare should be hiked .
Meeting with Vajpayee
Subsequently , Mamata Banerjee met Prime Minister , Vajpayee yesterday at his residence and discussed the railway budget for an hour .
The Finance Minister , Yeshwant Sinha and top railway officials were also present .
It appears that the row between Finance Minister Yeshwant Sinha and the Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee over the railway fare hike was discussed .
Mamata refused to reveal the details of the meeting .
I can &apos;t say anything about the railway budget .
“ But this was a good meeting , ” is all that she said .
Minister Sinha Assures Industrialists that in the Union Budget to be Presented next 28th , Direct Tax Won &apos;t Be Hiked - Customs Duty Will Be Reduced .
New Delhi , Feb.15- Union Minister , Yeshwant Sinha assured the industrialists that in the Union budget to be presented next 28th , there would be no increase in the direct taxes and customs duty would be cut down .
Yesterday , a conference of industrialists was organized by ASSOCHAM in Delhi .
The Union Finance Minister , Yeshwant Sinha inaugurated the conference and spoke on the occasion .
He said : -
The Union Budget to be presented next 28th in the parliament won &apos;t disappoint you .
Your expectations would be met .
No Tax Hike
There won &apos;t be any hike in the direct tax in the next budget .
I assure that the direct taxes won &apos;t be hiked .
At the same time , there won &apos;t be any tax concessions and tax holidays hereafter .
Income-Tax Rate
In India , the personal earnings are taxed to a maximum of 30 percent .
We tax at 35 percent for corporate revenue .
A very low figure when compared with other countries
வேண ் டுகோள ் Request
Lowering of Import Tax
In the budget , the import duties would be reduced .
Businessmen should gear themselves to face its impact .
They plead that the duties for the import of raw materials should be reduced .
In that case it is not justified to demand that high custom duties should be levied on the goods imported from abroad .
He said .
For the last two years , Russia has held the fourth position in the list of countries selling weapons across the world .
The first three positions go to the US , Britain , and France .
A Great Agreement

Following this agreement , another agreement , worth 800 million dollar ( around 36,000 million rupees ) , to supply 124 T-90 tanks , will be signed between India and Russia in New Delhi .

Don &apos;t Call Bharathidasan A Mudaliar and Use Him in Caste Politics , Says His Grandson Angrily
Chennai , Feb. 15 - The name of Pavendar Bharathidasan shouldn &apos;t be used in caste politics , says his grandson angrily .
C. Veeramani Bharathidasan is the grandson of Pavendar Bharathidasan . In a statement he said : -
As the grandson of the revolutionary poet Bharathidasan , I submit my plea to the Tamil society .
The Tamil Heart
Our poet was born in the Mudaliar community , but did he think only of the Mudaliars ?
Or , did only the Mudaliar community support and hail him ?
His heart beat for Tamil and Tamil alone , nothing else .
He thought only about the Tamil race .
What did he want other than that the Tamils should be united ?
He was celebrated among the Tamils across the world as a poet , beyond the confines of caste , religion and race .
Some people are trying to constrain the great egalitarian poet within the cage of a community of Mudaliars .
Not only do the members of the New Justice Party , a Mudaliar community party , claim that the poet belonged to their community , they also use his name and photographs .
Alas , nothing is worse than this tragedy . I would say that they dare to indulge in such activities only because the poet is no more .
Today , the fact is that many great people who belong to the entire humanity are portrayed as the proponents of particular castes ; let us prevent the same fate from happening to Pavendar .
Come together to prevent the small minded people from hijacking the poet who had stolen the hearts of Tamils .
Warning
The Mudaliar community has not selected any one as its representative unanimously .
People seeking political gains should immediately stop using the name of the great poet .
We call upon the Tamil people to prevent the desecration of the name of the peerless poet who is no more but is still fêted by the Dravidian parties , national parties and the people from all religions .
I hope that the New Justice Party members will demonstrate that they too have courage by not ignoring this warning .
He said .
Gujarat earthquake relief fund : Karunanidhi announced that the Tamil Nadu government has till now collected 200 million rupees .
Chennai , Feb. 15- Chief Minister Karunanidhi announced that 200 million rupees have been collected till now in Tamil Nadu as an aid to the people affected by the Gujarat earthquake .
Gujarati
After receiving them , Chief Minister Karunanidhi said : -
There was a delay in my arriving at the function as ( I ) had to attend another function at Valluvar Kottom .
The people of Tamil Nadu offered donation to show their compassion for the victims and this also reflected on the generosity of Tamils and Tamil Nadu , in general .
It was collected by the government of Tamil Nadu , Raj Television and many other organizations .
Dedication
As a beacon of light in Gujarat and to spread the light of grace , compassion and love , and to ensure that the people of the state of Gujarat lead a peaceful life , we have donated what we could offer .
War Relief
As was mentioned by the person who delivered the introductory speech , Tamil Nadu has always been on the forefront to empathize and extend a helping hand whenever there has been a calamity in India .
I am proud of the fact that no state in India can match Tamil Nadu .
You know .
During Bangladesh war , when I was the Chief Minister and Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister , I invited her to Chennai .
I offered sixty million rupees as war relief fund .
Tamil Nadu was the only state which offered such a large amount of sixty million rupees .
While handing it over to her on the stage , I told her that -
Dear Madam , your state of Uttar Pradesh is many times larger than Tamil Nadu .
It gave only forty million .
While I have given you sixty million .
In reply Madam Indira Gandhi said her state of Uttar Pradesh was a backward state and so it couldn ’ t afford more .
Rs.50
Crore
Later , during the Kargil war , when Prime Minister Vajpayee appealed for the war fund , our Tamil Nadu government handed over 500 million rupees , beating all other states .
Also when the people of Orissa were in distress and were crying out for relief , after a cyclone hit Orissa , Tamil Nadu collected funds and goods worth approximately fifty million .
He spoke .
Excellent Arrangements
Raj TV will also be handing over to Chief Minister Karunanidhi , the sum that was put in the collection boxes installed at various venues on Marina beach , by the participants in the event .

The picture shows Punita who committed suicide , and her husband , Suresh .
Salem , February 15-
Yesterday , the Valentine &apos;s Day was celebrated across the country .
A woman who had married after falling in love , committed suicide by hanging herself , on that day . This sensational incident occurred at Salem . The details are as follows :
Vijayakumar ( aged 40 ) lives at Karungalpatti , Salem .
He is a weaver .
Punita ( aged 25 ) was his daughter .
Punita , a graduate , was in love with her neighbor , P.Suresh ( age 26 ) . Suresh works as a veterinary doctor in Pollachi .
They belonged to different religions .
Parents who came to know about the love affair , were opposed to it .
Marriage
Later , the couple sought refuge at the women &apos;s police station with the help of Municipal Counselor Savundappan .
Then , they got married at Easwaran Temple .
They got married two years ago .
They have an one-year old male child .
Two days ago , Suresh left Pollachi for his official duties .
Punita , her father-in-law , and mother-in-law were at home .
Yesterday morning , Punita &apos;s room door was found locked .
Punita hadn &apos;t come out of the room for a longtime .
The parents-in-law were shocked when they opened the door .
Punita was found hanging and was dead .
Later , a complaint was registered in the Kichipalayam police station .
Inspector Somasundaram , Sub-inspector Perumal and the other police officials registered the case and started an investigation .
Letter
Letters written by Punita were found in the room .
Police seized them and are looking at various angles .
On hearing about the death of Punita , her parents rushed to the spot .
Parents and their relatives wept on seeing the body .
It was a heart-rending sight .
The death of the young woman created a sensation in the area of Karungalpatti .
Many mourners saw Punita &apos;s body and left sobbing .
“ By Entering into a Love Marriage , I Pushed Myself into a Ditch &quot; , the Moving Letters of the Young Woman
Picture shows Punita , who committed suicide in Karungalpatti , Salem .
As Punita had been married for just two years before the death , the Deputy Collector Subramani rushed to the spot and started inquiry yesterday ( Wednesday ) .
He interrogated Punita &apos;s parents and the family members of her husband , Suresh .
Meanwhile , Suresh , who was in Udumalpet , came to Salem after being informed about the death of his wife .
Many people had gathered in front of the house .
He went to the top floor and saw the body of his wife and sobbed uncontrollably .
Soon he collapsed .
What &apos;s the reason ?
Torture for dowry was reportedly the reason behind Punita ’ death .
Suresh was living in Udumalpet and Punita wanted to go and live with him there .
But Suresh had refused .
Apparently Suresh ’ s father used to torture Punita to get money as dowry .
According to the police , this may have broken Punita ’ s heart , and driven her to commit suicide .
Meanwhile , a letter written by Punita for the police was also found .
The details of Punita ’ s letter to the police are as follows :
I am tired of life and so am choosing death .
My cowardly heart is responsible for my suicide .
Nobody should be held responsible for my death .
I entered into a love marriage .
I have not been happy since the first day of marriage .
By leaving my parents and marrying Suresh , I pushed myself into the ditch .
As my husband is in Udumalpet , the loneliness kills me .
I am tired of living .
So , I am leaving this world .
Yours , Punita
This is what she wrote
to her parents
Similarly , the details of the letter Punita wrote to her parents are as follows :
Both of you are merciless demons .
Father is a big liar .
Let my life be a lesson to all .
My death will bring you agony , disgrace and sorrow .
Take care of my child in my memory .
Let agony and sorrow come to those who were indirectly responsible for my death- my husband , my mother and father who have no love , my father-in-law and mother-in-law who are greedy demons , my relatives , and those who spoke ill of me .
This is what she wrote in the letter
to her husband , Suresh .
In another letter written to her husband , Suresh , “ Pardon me as you got a bad name because of me . ”
Your father would not let me go with you to Udumalpet .
He said he needs money to build a house .
You live , earn and give it to them .
Let them build houses for your elder brother .
They will leave you in the lurch .
How much did they blame me !
I tolerated everything and survived .
Now , you are also not here .
So , I am leaving this world .
Yours in love , forever .
I am dying on the day of the lovers .
Good bye , Suri ...
This is what she wrote .
Punita , who had committed suicide , also left behind names and residence telephone numbers of her relatives and requested that they be informed of her death .

6.5 million weavers
There are 6.5 million weavers in the handloom industry in India .
The Union government has taken various steps to improve the industry .
Hathkargha Protsahan Yojana ( Weavers Welfare Scheme ) was implemented with a plan outlay of Rs.6.5 billion .
In this , the Central government ’ s share is 3600 million rupees .
The rest is that of the state governments .
The weavers are given loans , looms , facilities , training and assistance in selling their product , through this .
For creating handloom room and yarn weaving facility , Rs . 20,000 loan will be provided . Rs . 15,000 will be provided as short term loan . For yarn purchase , Central Government will have to give Rs . 2,000 , State Government will have to give Rs . 1,000 and weavers have to give Rs . 1,000 .

Tamil Nadu minister N.K.K.Periyasamy suggested that the weaver &apos;s share of Rs.1000 could be made available through Societies . Even the weavers who are not members of cooperative societies , will be considered for the benefits of the scheme .
I appreciate the efforts of the Tamil Nadu government in implementing various welfare schemes for the weavers .
It includes schemes like issuing identity cards .
The other states should come forward to follow such schemes
Export
Today , many useful suggestions were made in the conference .
The Central Government would take them into account .
Such conferences had already been organized in Guwahati , and later in Delhi , to protect the handloom industry .
Next one would be organized in Mumbai .

It would be raised further .

Those who are accompanying him now are not like his former associates .
They are very strong ,
and resolute , said Nedumaran , in a meeting held last time .
Seeing from that perspective , the only alternative is a self-surrender .

Those who couldn &apos;t fulfill that , won &apos;t fulfill this also .

Let us wait and watch .

He has his land at his native place that is left fallow .
I will work there and raise my children .
I am resolute .
But , one thing .
You said the fight was going on .
They said he had escaped .
Why didn ’ t those who had surrounded him , fight and nab him ?
Why did they hide ?
Why did they retreat ?
He will stand up and fight .
He won &apos;t retreat .
That is what I would say .
My “ thali ” is very strong .

The One-Sided Love Turns into Tragedy : A Girl Student Murdered for Refusing to Have Sex : Youth Arrested
Alangulam , Feb.15 - A clue has been obtained in the murder case of a girl student near Alangulam . A person having a one-sided love affair with the girl strangled her to death when she refused to have sex with him .
A school girl , Vasanthakumari ( aged 15 ) , was murdered and her body was found lying on the Marandhai Road at night two days ago .
In the police enquiry the information regarding what for she was murdered has come out .
One-sided Love
Subramaniam belongs to Chettikurichi .

Vasanthakumari ( aged 14 ) was the older daughter .
She was a student of ninth grade at the government high school at Marandhai .
Her sister Siva and brother Sureshbabu were in the 6th standard in the same school .
Vasanthakumari was a bright student .
It is reported that Sudalai ( aged 22 ) , son of Isakki of Thenkalam , used to stake her on her way to school and make passes at her .
But the student ignored his passes and concentrated on her studies .
The day before yesterday , when she was on her way as usual , Sudalai noticed that the road was deserted and he thought that was the right time to satisfy his lust .
Attempt to Rape
He gagged Vasanthakumari ’ s mouth and took her to a hideout down in a nearby channel .
He stuffed a cloth in her mouth and forced her to comply with his desire .
But , she tried to escape and run away from his grip .
Provoked at this , the enraged youth strangled her to death .
Then the person escaped .
Arrest
Following the incident , there was tension in the village .
A case had already been registered in the Alangulam police station against Sudalai , as he had once attempted to molest and kill another woman in Marandhai .

E-Mail lovers in Japan
The number of e-mail lovers is growing day-by-day in Japan .
The reason given was that it was so easy to choose a proper mate through e-mail , be it men or women .
Those who want to fall in love , select their mate through e-mail .
For sometime , they continue their friendship only through e-mail without meeting in person .
Once they get to understand each other well , they meet in person to continue their relationship .
They also enter into matrimony .

She is a beautiful and shapely woman . She was married to Rajkumar , a coolie , eleven years ago .
The couple has two sons aged ten and six respectively .
Extra-marital Affair
The housemaid Indu and David had an intimate relationship
It developed into an extra-marital affair and they were going steady as a couple and their relationship had grown into an intimate one .
Meanwhile , David , the groom , and Indu were both found missing since last 10th .
Complaint
Salomi , David &apos;s sister and Rajkumar , Indu &apos;s husband , have registered complaints to the Thiruvotriyur police independently in this regard .
Sub-inspector Thirumalai registered a case and tried to trace David and Indu .
But the police couldn &apos;t find the unwedded couple .
Marriage cancelled
So the marriage arranged on the 12th between David and Jansi Rani was cancelled .
Surrender
Subsequently , David and Indu , the absconding unwedded couple , surrendered day before yesterday to the Thiruvotriyur police .
Inspector Navin Chandran Nagesh interrogated them .
Then Indu said , “ I have been married to Rajkumar for 11 years . We have two sons . My husband , who is a daily wage earner , cannot manage my household expenses properly .
I had an affair with David , who is financially better off .
He understood my needs and helped me financially .
So , I used to go with David and lie to my husband Rajkumar .
We used to have sex .
It continued for months together .
We have come to a stage that neither of us can live without each other .
Meanwhile , a marriage was arranged for David .
I was afraid that he would give me up .
So I eloped with him .
We have now decided to live as husband and wife .
She pleaded that they should unite them , not separate them .
It appears that David too said the same thing .
Compensation
By this time , Indu &apos;s husband had come to know that both David and Indu had gone to the police station .
Immediately , he took his two children there .
Seeking justice , the bride Jansi Rani &apos;s relatives also came to the station .
Members of the families of Jansi Rani and David held talks in the presence of the officers .

Later , the officers asked Indu to go along with David .
Rajkumar , who lost his wife to the unwedded lover , returned home with his two children , deeply disappointed and with a heavy heart .
A Dog Was Let Loose On The Census Officers , Stringent Punishment If Mischief Done : Officer ’ s Warning .

Tamil Nadu Director of Indian Population Census C.Chandramouli met the press yesterday . He said : _
The census exercise is underway across India now .
It started on the 9th .
The names can be added until the night of 28th .
We sought the help of NGOs to enlist the names of those who live in slums and on the pavements and have no ration cards .
Around 100,000 people are involved in the exercise in Tamil Nadu .
Cooperation should be given to the census officers who go door to door .
In Thiruvallur , a dog was let loose on the officers who had entered a house .
A complaint was registered regarding the incident .
In another case , the name of a dog was also added to census list .
Those who indulged in such mischief would be punished under the census laws .
They may even go to prison for such misconduct .
So , I appeal that the public should extend full cooperation to the officers .
Those who have moved to a new place should add their name in the new place too .
They should also give the past addresses and other details .
He said .
Not Handsome , Says the Wife . The Husband Commits Suicide .
Poonamalee , Feb.15 - Wife ignored husband for not being handsome . Heartbroken by this , the husband committed suicide .
Ragavan is from Thirumangad colony in Sungvarchatram , near Sri Perumbudur .
Ramesh was his son ( aged 22 ) .
He married Shailaja ( aged 20 ) 11 months ago .
Now , Shailaja is 6-months pregnant .
There were frequent altercations between the husband and the wife .
So , Ramesh used to be depressed .
Day before yesterday night , he poured kerosene over his body and set himself ablaze .
He screamed as the fire engulfed his body and he was taken to the government hospital in Sri Perumbudur by his wife Shailaja and mother Renuka .
They took him to Kilpauk Government Hospital for further treatment .
Ramesh died before the treatment could save him .
Police Inspector Gajendran , Sub-Inspector Ezhumalai , Head Constables Sampath and Ezhumalai of Sunguvarchatram registered a case and started investigation .
What &apos;s the reason ?
The investigation reveals that Shailaja looked down upon Ramesh by telling him that he was not good looking and that it led to frequent quarrels between them which made Ramesh depressed and led him to commit suicide .
The police continued the investigation on this angle .
Complacency of Officers Causes Delay : Husband Arrested Six Years after the Registration of Case of His Wife &apos;s Suicide .
Tambaram , February15- The man who prompted his wife to commit suicide was arrested after 6 years .
Munian resides at the Oorappakkam near Tambaram .
Saraswathi ( age 25 ) was his wife .
They loved each other and got married .
Before the marriage , Saraswathi used to work in a leather factory and Munian in a tea shop . Their marriage took place in 1994 .
The Suicide
Within a year of the marriage , on September 11,1995 , Saraswathi committed suicide by jumping before an electric train in Oorappakkam .
Thandaiyarpettai Tahsildar Sethurama Krishnan investigated the case of Saraswathi ’ s suicide .
He said in his report that she committed suicide only on the insistence of her husband Munian .
The report was sent in 1997 to the then Kanchipuram collector Iraiyanbu .
He forwarded it to the Chengai West Police Superintendent directing him to take very stringent action in the case .
The report was then sent to Guduvanchery police station .
The Report on the Tour
Saying that it came under the railway police jurisdiction , the Guduvanchery police sent it back to the Thandaiarpettai Tahsildar office .
6 years elapsed since then .
Even Sethurama Krishnan who wrote the report got transferred .
Revisited
Sirajudeen , the current Tehsildar of Thandaiyarpettai has taken action and sent the report to the Superintendent of the Railway Police .
Egmore railway DSP had sent the report yesterday to Thambaram railway police .
Then , the Tambaram Railway Police Inspector Thangarai reopened the case file of Saraswathi ’ s suicide , which was committed in 1995 .
He arrested Saraswathi &apos;s husband Munian , by transferring the case from 174 CrPC to 498 A as per the report given by the Tehsildar .
The complacency of the officials .
It is said that the king gives instant punishment while God waits before punishing .
But , in the Saraswathy suicide case , the government officers acted like God and waited for a long time .
Munian , who had even forgotten the death of his wife , is behind bars six years after he was charged with the crime of being responsible for his wife &apos;s death .
How can one deny that the reason was anything other than the complacency of the officers .
Unidentified persons who made telephone calls worth 1.5 million rupees absconds .
They also got ISD connections .
They dialed numbers abroad and talked the whole day , as much as they wished .
For this , K. Arun got a telephone bill for Rs.1,256,175 and S. Rajan got a telephone bill for Rs.216,330. When the visibly shocked telephone officials enquired about this , both the above-mentioned persons absconded .
Fraud
Puyalrani , the Junior Engineer of Gummidipoondi Telephones has lodged a complaint with the Gummidipoondi police regarding a unique fraud .
Headed by Gummidipoondi Police Inspector Subramani , Sub-inspector George Fernandes and Head Constable Kuppusamy registered a case and started investigations .
We will not refrain from privatization even if the public sector units make a profit , Finance Minister Sinha determined
New Delhi , March 2 – Finance Minister Sinha said that he would not abandon plans to privatize even if private sector units make a profit .
Addressing a seminar on the Union Budget organized by the industrialists ’ federation in Delhi , finance minister Yashwant Sinha said :
We took all aspects into account while preparing the budget .
We have decided to continue with the privatization of public sector units .
Nobody needs to doubt it .
It ’ s now time to discuss privatization openly .
Whether public sector units make a profit or a loss ,
we will not sway from our decision to privatize them .
We will not change , even if political parties criticize us on this .
They have the wrong attitude about privatization .
The budget states that revenue of 120,000 million rupees would be generated by selling shares .
In the interests of the nation
Opposition parties accuse me of having prepared the 4th budget on CII ’ s bidding .
This is allegation is false .
This budget has been prepared by keeping in mind the long-term interests of the nation , and especially of the coming generations .
This budget was not prepared for short-term benefits , but for development .
The commerce department should follow second-generation reforms with a firm approach .
Especially , the interests of the workers should be protected .
45 days ’ salary
When a worker is dismissed , he or she must be paid 45 days ’ salary instead of 15 days ’ salary .
The government is also considering offering an insurance plan for factory workers .
It has been decided that bankrupt companies should provide 45 days ’ salary and profitable companies should provide 60 days ’ salary as compensation to employees leaving under the voluntary retirement plan in public sector units .
But it ’ s not known why private companies are unable to provide this amount .
One can ’ t afford to look at just one viewpoint while amending labor laws .
The important objective of this reform is to improve the Indian industry and increase various employment opportunities .
Small-scale industries
Removing some categories from the list of small-scale industries does not mean that the government is opposed to small-scale industries .
This project is being introduced for the long-term benefit of the country .
There are no alternatives for this if India has to compete with countries like China and face challenges on the global level .
This is to attract a considerable amount of investment , especially foreign investment .
Reduction of interest
Many people find fault with the reduction in interest for small savings .
This move was meant to prevent providing subsidies indirectly ,
the minister said .
Govt. rejects members ’ plea – MP constituency development fund cannot be 30 million rupees .
New Delhi , March 2 – The government has announced that
the MP constituency development fund cannot be increased to 30 million rupees .
and rejected the plea .
Complaint
Some members complained that district officials demand huge bribes from people who receive constituency development funds at the time of giving checks .
Replying to this , Finance Minister Sinha said that MPs would be notified in advance about giving checks .
Plus 2 – SSLC exams :
Important announcement by the director : new examination system for computer science – make a request for re-evaluation and you get copies of your answer sheets
Chennai , March 2 – Paramasivam , the Director of the higher secondary and SSLC Examinations department ,
gave an interview in Chennai .
He made an important announcement in his interview .
He said that answer sheets would be made available for re-evaluations .
higher secondary , SSLC , OSLC ,
Matriculation and Anglo-Indian Examinations department Director Paramasivam gave an interview to news people in Chennai . He
said : -
the 27th of this month and will end on the 9th of next month .
Matriculation and Anglo-Indian examinations will begin on the 22nd and will end on the 9th of next month .
The question papers and answer sheets for these exams are ready .
We have sent them to the relevant exam centers .
More female students
There will be more female students than male students sitting for this year ’ s exams .
Higher Secondary examinations will be held in 1287 centers across Tamilnadu .
395,001 students will be sitting for these exams .
2040 exam centers have been set up for the SSLC exams . 646,234 students will be sitting for these exams . 76,000 Matriculation students will be sitting for their exams at 350
exam centers .
4869 Anglo-Indian students will be sitting for their exams at 29 centers
Computer Science exams
This year we have introduced a new system for computer science exams for the first time .
In this system , a separate answer sheet for 75 marks will be provided . The students have to choose the correct answers by shading the appropriate boxes with a pencil .
The answer sheet should be submitted to the teacher immediately after the exam .
We have already tried this approach and found that it ensures the faster correction of answer sheets .
This method is called the OMR
examination method .
From next year on , this method will be introduced for other subjects , too .
This method will ensure accuracy in examination results .
Special examinees
We have planned to announce the exam results for special examinees the same day as school students from this year .
Already the answer sheets of school students are given fictitious numbers before evaluation .
Similarly , the special examinees ’ answer sheets will also be given fictitious numbers before being sent for evaluation .
This will enable us to announce results for students of both categories simultaneously .
Until now , fictitious numbers were given only for 10 subjects before evaluation .
Now fictitious numbers will be given for the answer sheets of all subjects .
In addition , we have planned to announce the exam results in advance and have made the appropriate arrangements for this .
New syllabus
A new syllabus has been introduced for higher secondary mathematics .
Special examinees and students appearing for improvement can appear in the exams under the old syllabus .
Separate question papers have been created for this .
Answer sheets
Earlier , we used to extend only the facility of recounting marks subsequent to the distribution of mark sheets after the examinations were over . ( So far we permitted only re-totaling of marks after the dispatch of mark sheets to students )
Biology and Mathematics .
Copies of answer sheets will be given within 20 days of applying for the sheets .
Iron boxes
We have bought a thousand iron boxes to keep the answer sheets safe .
The iron boxes are ready for safekeeping the answer sheets .
Armed policemen will safeguard them around the clock .
We have set up air squads to keep vigil over the exams .
We will also put up a notice that students who copy in the exam centers will not be allowed to sit for the exams for 5 years ,
he said .
Deputy Directors Marimuthu and Vasanthi Jeevanandam were also present during the interview .
We won ’ t allow the height of Mullai Periyar dam to be raised : Kerala Chief Minister adamant
Thiruvananthapuram , March 2 – Chief Minister of Kerala Nayanar vehemently declared in the Kerala Assembly that he would not permit any action to raise the water level of the Mullai Periyar dam .

In the assembly ,
while replying to a question asked in the Kerala Assembly yesterday by Congressman E. M. Augusty , Chief Minister Nayanar
said : -
The state government will not allow any action to be taken on the Mullai Periyar dam controversy , including attempts to raise the water level of the dam .
Raising the height of the dam will endanger the lives and property of the people in the area .
We have conveyed this to the Supreme Court in an affidavit .
Committee of ministers
The Central Water Commission has set up an experts ’ committee without consulting the state government .
Kerala does not approve of this .
A ministerial sub-committee is monitoring the dam case . Three affidavits have been filed ,
he said .

Colombo , March 2 -
Anton Balasingam , advisor to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , has expressed his strong disapproval of the British government ’ s decision to add the LTTE , the organization that fights for the rights of native Tamil people in Sri Lanka , to the list of terrorist organizations .

The LTTE is the true representative of Eelam Tamils .
It has been fighting for the rights of Eelam Tamils for the past 25 years .
Adding such a freedom movement to the terrorist list is deplorable .
Day of mourning
This is a sad day for Anglo-Tamil relations .
It is a huge disappointment for the Tamil people fighting together in Sri Lanka .
This will affect the welfare of Tamils in Elam .
This will also affect the Norwegian peace efforts to bring the war in Sri Lanka to an end .
Yet LTTE will continue its peace efforts .
We will cooperate with the peace process .
Moreover , the British government ’ s decision will benefit the Sri Lankan government .
The Sinhalese army will be instigated to destroy the Elam Tamil race .
The soldiers would then attack brutally .
This is a victory for Buddhist fanatics .
It ’ s a deadly blow for peace and justice ,
said Balasingam .
Welcome

In various places in Sri Lanka , innocent Tamils are attacked under the pretext of attacking the LTTE . Harsh restrictions have also been placed in Tamil areas in the name of keeping the Tigers in check .

In Tokyo today , the parliament passed new laws on juvenile crime .
Children as young as 14 may now be tried as adults .
Mark Litke reports from Tokyo .
It is no longer that unusual -- three violent juvenile crimes make the national news on a single day .
An extortion , an assault , a murder by a boy who said he wanted to know what it felt like to kill .
Shocked and worried Japanese have no shortage of explanations .
Too much video game violence , not enough parental supervision , too few job opportunities .
But many now believe the roots go much deeper .
Kids on the street now speak openly about feeling a sense of rage or wanting to strike out , a nothing-to-lose mentality with no traditional sense of shame for failure .
And many do fail .
Jails and reform schools for young Japanese are filled to capacity .
The school tries to provide the attention they never received at home or school , a mix of education , discipline and chores , with time for team sports to emphasize group responsibility .
Sociologists here say these schools are a good start , but they fear Japan &apos;s juvenile crime crisis may only be just beginning .
One sign was visible on live television recently as millions of viewers watched a bus hijacking by a teenager armed with a kitchen knife .
Before it was over , he had stabbed three women , killing one .
He told police he wanted revenge against the parents and society he hated .
And , he wanted to be famous .
Mark Litke , ABC News , Tokyo .
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across the Middle East Thursday , demonstrating against military strikes on Iraq and calling on Muslims to wage jihad against the United States and its allies .
Protests against the action aimed at toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were held in cities across Libya , Egypt and Lebanon , as well as in Amman , Damascus and the Gaza Strip .
However , there were no reports of protests against the war from the Gulf states , many of whom are host to US military personnel .
Saudi Arabia , however , expressed its &quot; deep concern &quot; and regret over the start of US military operations .
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal spoke of the &quot; kingdom &apos;s hope for a quick halt in military action and for the return to peaceful efforts &quot; , the state SPA news agency reported .
In Riyadh &apos;s first reaction to the start of the against , he also called for Iraq &apos;s &quot; unity , internal security and territorial integrity &quot; to be preserved and rejected military occupation .
The Palestinian Authority also condemned Thursday &apos;s early morning missile strikes on Iraq , and warned Israel not to exploit the conflict .
&quot; We Palestinians are against the war and we totally condemn this war in the Middle East .
A solution must be found to this problem through diplomatic means , with the international community , &quot; local authorities minister Saeb Erakat said .
The war &quot; shows the impotence of all Arab states .
We call on all Arab states to act immediately to defend Iraq and counter the US war , &quot; he said .
Demonstrations also took place in the northern Egyptian cities of Alexandria , Tanta and Kafr el-Sheikh .
South of the capital in Sidon , some 1,500 schoolboys denounced &quot; the Bush assassin &quot; and the &quot; silence of the Arab leaders who sold out Iraq &quot; .
&quot; Tell me how this ends , &quot; one senior officer asked the Post .
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld dismissed worries that there were insufficient forces in the Gulf region if the battle for Baghdad goes wrong .
Meanwhile Blair arrived in Washington late Wednesday for two days of talks with Bush at the Camp David presidential retreat .
Talks were to focus on how to run a post-Saddam Iraq , with Washington resisting a large United Nations role .
Blair and Bush were to hold a joint press conference at 1600 GMT Thursday .
Britain has deployed some 45,000 troops to fight with the more than 250,000 US soldiers lined up against Iraqi troops .
Bush gave a new , stronger warning that the war could become drawn out .
At the last minute , Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the campaign was &quot; ahead of schedule . &quot;
A senior administration official said the president had decided to be cautious .
Bush pointedly paid tribute to the 48-nation &quot; coalition of the willing &quot; -- particularly Britain -- that is publicly backing the campaign .
Separately , US Secretary of State Colin Powell emphasized US determination to pursue the military campaign despite the diplomatic pressure Washington faces at the United Nations .
Powell , the most moderate member of the Bush cabinet , said he fully agreed with the president &apos;s policy on Iraq and had no plans to leave .
&quot; Personally , I &apos;m very much in sync with the president and he values my services , &quot; he said in an interview with National Public Radio .
&quot; We cannot forgive this war , &quot; Miyako Fuji , 20 , one of the rally &apos;s organisers told Jiji news agency .
&quot; I want to join together the feelings of each of us as individuals who oppose the war . &quot;
The protest follows a string of others involving tens of thousands of peace activists across Japan since January .
According to a poll by Kyodo news agency released Saturday , 78 of 100 people surveyed opposed the military action in Iraq .
Former senior banker Callum McCarthy begins what is one of the most important jobs in London &apos;s financial world in September , when incumbent Howard Davies steps down .
Davies is leaving to become chairman of the London School of Economics , one of the best-known parts of the University of London .
McCarthy currently heads the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets , or Ofgem , which regulates Britain &apos;s privatised energy industry .
As well as previously holding senior positions at Barclays Bank , BZW and Kleinwort Benson , McCarthy was formerly a top civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry .
Under Davies &apos;s watch , the FSA became Britain &apos;s sole regulatory body for financial services in November 2001 , taking on the various functions of nine separate agencies .
A Pakistani court in central Punjab province has sentenced a Christian man to life imprisonment for a blasphemy conviction , police said Sunday .
In a verdict handed down on Saturday , the judge also ordered Ranjha to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees ( about 870 US dollars ) , they said .
The Pakistani supreme court last year aquitted Ayub Masih , who had denied uttering any word against Islam or the Prophet Mohammad .
Blasphemy is punishable by death under the Pakistan Penal Code .
However , no blasphemy convict has ever been executed in the country .
Vivendi Universal officials in the United States were not immediately available for comment on Friday .
Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up Universal Orlando .
The group , once a French utilities company , needs to reshape itself in order to slash its huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars .
In 2002 , the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros -- the biggest ever in France -- on sales of 28.7 billion .
&quot; We discussed the Middle East peace process .
&quot; Qatar is a very important country on this issue .
I know the special relationship that the Qatari foreign minister has with Abu Mazen , &quot; he said , using Abbas &apos;s alternative name .
The meeting was Shalom &apos;s first encounter with an Arab counterpart since he took office as Israel &apos;s foreign minister on February 27 .
Qatar has economic links with Israel without maintaining diplomatic relations , in the face of criticism from other Arab countries .
Afterwards Shalom was to fly on to London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw .
&quot; Both said they look forward to seeing each other in Evian .
They also touched on Afghanistan , the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and on the global economy , &quot; said Fleischer .
&quot; We &apos;ve always been on good terms .
We just disagree on one item , &quot; the Canadian leader said .
&quot; The country is being ruled by a bachelor president and an unmarried prime minister .
This according to the Hindu shastras ( books ) is very inauspicious and that is the reason there is a widespread heatwave and drought , &quot; said Singh .
&quot; Not just Prime Minister Vajpayee but President Kalam &apos;s bachelor status is making the country dry , arid and infertile , &quot; he added .
The general secretary of Vajpayee &apos;s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party , Pramod Mahajan , retorted that Singh &apos;s statement was &quot; beneath contempt . &quot;
India &apos;s has been reeling under a heatwave since mid-May which has killed 1,403 people .
The country &apos;s western desert state of Rajasthan is also bracing for its fifth straight year of drought .
Police officers took up their positions across the Gaza Strip , enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the intifada exploded in September 2000 , the source said .
&quot; Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they held before September 28 , 2000 .
It is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the intifada , &quot; the source said .
Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday , police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya , he said .
They also deployed along the border with Israel .
Although there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway , several other roads remained temporarily closed , he said .
Another road , leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis , would be opened within 10 days , he said .
A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on Monday or early Tuesday .
The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians , security sources said .
Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing , which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising .
The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands , said Prof Mauser , a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada .
He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain &apos;s streets .
In the past two years , there have been cases of schoolchildren and a baby , killed or injured by guns .
&quot; I believe that factors of political correctness are at work , &quot; he said .
Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June .
Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London , Birmingham and Manchester .
It doesn &apos;t matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain .
Just as long as it &apos;s there , they feel safe .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a Q &amp; A with the troops today that was anything but cozy .
Disgruntled soldiers complained to Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and other equipment .
From the Associated Press : &quot; You go to war with the Army you have , &quot; Rumsfeld replied , &quot; not the Army you might want or wish to have . &quot;
Shouts of approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had assembled to see Rumsfeld .
&quot; We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north , &quot; Wilson , 31 , of Nashville , Tenn . , concluded after asking again .
Rarely , though , is it put so bluntly in a public forum .
What is more , he said , armor is not the savior some think it is .
&quot; You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can ( still ) be blown up , &quot; he said .
Can &apos;t say that &apos;s the most comforting answer .
If passed next November , residents would have 90 days to give up firearms they keep in their homes or businesses .
The proposal was immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group .
Gun Owners of California , a Sacramento-based lobbying group , quickly called the ban illegal .
Sam Paredes , the group &apos;s executive director , said state law bars local governments from usurping the state &apos;s authority to regulate firearms .
Washington , D.C. , is the only major American city that currently bans handgun possession by private citizens .
Andrew Arulanandam , director of public affairs for the National Rifle Association , said San Francisco would be remiss to use that city as a model .
&quot; If gun control worked , Washington , D.C. , would be the beacon .
However , it &apos;s the murder capital of the United States , &quot; he said .
If approved , the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006 .
So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense and protection of the home is not allowed .
No thanks .
From the Associated Press : A baby girl who had been cut out of her mother &apos;s womb was found after a frantic search , and authorities arrested the woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child .
The baby was in good condition Saturday .
Lisa M. Montgomery , 36 , of Melvern , Kan . , was arrested later Friday and charged with kidnapping resulting in death .
Bobbie Jo Stinnett , 23 , was found Thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home in Skidmore , a town in northwest Missouri .
Stinnett , who was eight months pregnant , had earlier been talking with her mother on the phone , and hung up saying a woman she had chatted with online had just arrived at her door , authorities said .
U.S. Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted Stinnett through an online message board , and authorities zeroed in on her using computer forensics .
Montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from Stinnett , who raised rat terriers , he said .
According to the criminal complaint , Montgomery traveled about 40 miles to Topeka , Kan . , on Thursday to go shopping .
Her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth .
The next day , authorities say , Montgomery confessed that she strangled Stinnett from behind , cut her open , removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord .
I don &apos;t understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from a mother &apos;s womb a &quot; child &quot; or &quot; girl &quot; in a society that sanctions partial-birth abortion .
On a less-sarcastic note , I pray for the family of the 23-year-old woman .
No one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child and decided to kill for it .
If there &apos;s any good news in this story , it &apos;s that Victoria Jo will live on and carry her mother &apos;s memory .
Question for the pro-choicers : Being that it isn &apos;t yet the ninth month , can we still charge the killer with kidnapping ?
The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of a devastating 20-year-old policy that outlawed women from having more than one child .
As a result , only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys , because couples traditionally favor males .
So now by killing the males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap .
What a country !
One such activist is Mao Hengfeng , who was dismissed in 1988 from her job at a Shanghai soap factory after becoming pregnant a second time .
Last April , the Shanghai public security bureau sentenced her to 18 months in a labor camp for campaigning against the one-child policy .

A CNN poll asks readers to rate the president &apos;s State of the Union speech last night .
After 90,000 votes Mr. Bush has a &apos; C-C + &apos; grade across the board , meaning 45,000 Republicans gave him an &apos; A &apos; and 45,000 liberals failed him .
But a new CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll suggests more people side with the president .
70 percent of respondents said Bush &apos;s policies on health care were positive , while 66 percent approved of the president &apos;s plan for Social Security .
78 percent said U.S. policy in Iraq is hading in the right direction , a 12 percentage point increase over pre-speech polling .
Overall , 77 percent of respondents said Bush is taking the country in the right direction after the speech compared to 67 percent beforehand .
And who wasn &apos;t moved by the embrace of mother of a soldier killed in Iraq and the daughter of a man killed by Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime ?
It was a beautiful moment last night that resulted in the longest standing ovation of the evening .
Today the parents of Marine Corps Sgt. Byron Norwood said the Iraqi woman , Safia Taleb al-Suhail , had turned and introduced herself just before the speech .
It was an uplifting moment suggesting that maybe we &apos;re doing the right thing .
I talked to a friend currently serving in Iraq last night and he says morale is up and the presence of troops is a positive thing .
They just can &apos;t pack up and leave .
Not just yet .
We must be patient .
We &apos;ve all lived next to some pretty undesirable people at one point or another , but I can &apos;t imagine anyone being worse than this .

The gunman began shooting inside the Hudson Valley Mall shortly after 3 p.m. in Kingston , nearly 90 miles north of New York City .
The 24-year-old gunman went into a Best Buy store and started firing .
When he ran out of ammunition , he was captured by mall employees , police said .
Ulster Town Supervisor Fred Wadnola identified the gunman &apos;s weapon as an AK-47 assault rifle .
&quot; Everyone was running and screaming .
Then I heard the shots , &quot; witness Heather Craig told Fox News .
Whoa !
You &apos;re telling me someone was able to take an AK-47 &quot; assault rifle &quot; into a mall and injure people ? !
But it &apos;s New York .
They have gun laws !
But not in New York .
Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s wife will go on trial next week on charges of mismanaging state property during the former president &apos;s rule , a court said Thursday .
The trial will start on March 13 , the court said .
Milosevic and his wife wielded enormous power in Yugoslavia for more than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt in October 2000 .
The post-Milosevic government later extradited him to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague , the Netherlands .
Since then , many of Milosevic &apos;s political and business allies as well as his two children have been accused of crimes .
Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the U.S. troops .
Turks overwhelmingly oppose a war -- by 94 percent , according to some polls .
Earlier this month , the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes .
Erdogan has hinted that he will resubmit the resolution for approval , which could take another week .
The United States is pressing Turkey to act quickly .
Ships carrying equipment for U.S. troops are already waiting off the Turkish coast .
``I &apos;m not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it , but just be assured there will be a northern option , &apos; &apos; he said .
Also in Washington , Turkish Ambassador Farouk Logoglu told The Associated Press that the U.S. and Turkish militaries were holding informal discussions on the use of Turkish airspace .
The troop-basing resolution would allow the United States to use Turkish airspace .
Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose a US $ 15 billion U.S. aid package that Washington has offered to help cushion the country &apos;s economy if there is war .
It would also threaten Turkey &apos;s possible role in the future of Iraq .
Turkey , which fears northern Iraqi Kurds may declare independence in the aftermath of a war , has been pressing for a say if Saddam Hussein is ousted .
Secession by Iraqi Kurds could inspire Turkey &apos;s rebel Kurds , who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy .
After he was elected , Erdogan said Turkey wanted assurances from the United States on its role in Iraq .
Iraqi Kurds fear that Turkish troops could move deep into the autonomous enclave in northern Iraq and have threatened clashes .
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way for Erdogan , who won a parliamentary seat in by-elections Sunday .
Gul will remain as a caretaker prime minister until President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approves Erdogan &apos;s Cabinet , a move that could happen as early as Wednesday .
Erdogan said he would submit his Cabinet list to the president ``as soon as possible , &apos; &apos; and leaders of Erdogan &apos;s Justice and Development Party met Tuesday evening .
When asked about possible changes in the Cabinet , Erdogan said : ``Perhaps there will be a small amount of change , a certain number of revisions . &apos; &apos;
Gul &apos;s resignation had been long expected .
Erdogan heads the party but was constitutionally barred from running in November elections because he was jailed in 1999 for anti-secular activities .
The Justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the elections .
Erdogan , a leader of Turkey &apos;s pro-Islamic movement when he was jailed , said he moderated his policies in prison .
His party considers itself conservative and no longer uses the word &apos; Islamic &apos; in its literature .
He now also advocates letting in U.S. troops for a war against Iraq even though it is a fellow Muslim state .
Unlike the soft-spoken Gul , Erdogan has a reputation as a fighter .
``Erdogan will be willing to engage in a bruising confrontation in a way that Gul was not willing to , &apos; &apos; said Bulent Aliriza , an analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies .
``If Erdogan decides that for his own reasons , and not U.S. pressure , he wants this , he will push it through . &apos; &apos;
A furious Justice party member , Fehmi Husrev Kutlu , rushed toward Ozkan , bumping into him and sending his eyeglasses flying , Anatolia reported .
Other legislators surrounded the two to head off a brawl .
U.S. and British troops were moving on the strategic southern port city of Basra Saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded Baghdad at dawn .
Thousands of beleaguered Iraqi soldiers in the south surrendered in the face of the major push .
U.S. aircraft bombed Iraqi tanks holding bridges close to the city .
Iraqi forces responded with artillery fire .
Earlier Saturday , Baghdad was again targeted , one day after a massive U.S. aerial bombardment in which more than 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles rained down on the capital .
As coalition troops advanced , an entire Iraqi army division gave itself up , U.S. military officials said .
The division -- the 51st Infantry Division , with 8,000 men and as many as 200 tanks , a key unit in the defense of Basra -- was the largest defection in a day when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces showed signs of crumbling .
Allied successes were marred by the collision of two Royal Navy helicopters over the Persian Gulf in which all six British crew members and one American were killed .
American units advancing west of Basra have already secured the Rumeila oil field , whose daily output of 1.3 million barrels makes it Iraq &apos;s most productive .
Until Basra , U.S. and British troops had encountered little resistance , even when they seized nearby Umm Qasr , and moved to secure key oil fields .
Iraqis mostly fought back with small arms , pistols , machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades .
Regular Iraqi forces had withdrawn from Basra but elements of Saddam &apos;s security forces are continuing to resist , British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said Saturday .
Other units moved into airfield complexes in western Iraq believed to have Scud missiles capable of reaching Israel , and possibly weapons of mass destruction .
Early Saturday , more units were waiting in Kuwait to smash through any Iraqi resistance .
Hundreds of tanks , armored personnel carriers , Humvees and trucks were lined up in parallel columns waiting in single-file to cross the Iraqi-Kuwait border .
After weeks of delay , Turkey relented and agreed to let combat aircraft fly over its territory .
At the same time , however , Turkey sent 1,000 troops into northern Iraq , and the government said it would send more to prevent Iraqi Kurds from creating an independent state .
The United States strongly opposes any unilateral move by Turkey into northern Iraq .
A Turkish military spokesman on Saturday denied Turkish troops had crossed into Iraq .
There was no clear figure of Iraqi casualties .
Australian commandos , who have been operating deep in Iraq , destroyed a command and control post and killed a number of soldiers , according to the country &apos;s defense chief , Gen. Peter Cosgrove .
In an address Saturday , Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told Iraqis that fighting had been ``fierce . &apos; &apos;
He said most of those captured by allied forces were civilians , not soldiers .
He claimed Iraqi troops had destroyed five tanks .
He said more than 200 Iraqis had been injured , including women , children and other civilians who were being treated at five hospitals in Baghdad .
Hoon said Saddam &apos;s regime was crumbling under the pressure of a huge air assault .
``As last night &apos;s dramatic television coverage showed , the lights stayed on in Baghdad , but the instruments of tyranny are collapsing , &apos; &apos; he said .
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan , speaking on Iraqi Radio , was quoted by the British Broadcasting Corp. &apos; s monitoring service as accusing Britain and the United States of working to ``eliminate &apos; &apos; the state of Iraq .
Despite the heavy bombing , which the U.S. Central Command said targeted military command and control installations , the Iraqi regime gave no sign of quitting .
Bombers have also hit targets in the northern cities of Mosul , Kirkuk and Tikrit , Saddam &apos;s hometown .
The Iraqi government released a video of Saddam , in uniform , meeting with his son Qusai , the commander of the Republican Guard , and the defense minister , Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad .
It was unclear when the video was made .
Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital , Copenhagen .
He was sentenced to four months in prison , but appealed .
The hearing was scheduled for April 10 .
TV2 , quoting Toefting &apos;s lawyer Anders Nemeth , reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately .
Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment .
Earlier this month , Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal .
It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence .
The club said it wasn &apos;t aware of Toefting &apos;s decision to drop his appeal .
Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg .
Toefting has been convicted before .
In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg .
Toefting joined the Danish squad in 1993 and has 41 caps .
``A vise is closing on the regime , &apos; &apos; U.S. President George W. Bush said .
Some frontline units went on heightened alert against the threat of chemical weapons , ordered to wear rubber boots and suits despite temperatures that soared into the 90s .
There was fierce fighting in Kut , to the south of Baghdad , where desperate Iraqis armed with rifles charged tanks in a suicide raid .
``We mowed down &apos; &apos; the attackers , said Lt. Col. B.P. McCoy .
Despite declarations that more tough fighting lies ahead , the top U.S. military official indicated there may not be an all-out battle for Baghdad .
A meeting to organize an interim government could be held in Iraq within a week , a senior Pentagon official said Thursday night .
For the first time in the war , large parts of Baghdad lost electricity .
The cause was not known .
Myers told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that Americans had not targeted the power grid .
Tracer rounds lit the night sky and artillery boomed near the airport a few kilometers ( miles ) from the heart of President Saddam Hussein &apos;s capital of 5 million people .
At one stage , it appeared that U.S. forces had taken control of the airport , ``and then it got more confusing with continued fighting , Myers said Thursday night .
Capture of the airport would give American and British troops a facility for airlifting equipment and troops to Baghdad .
There were battlefield setbacks , as well .
Two Marines were killed and one injured in the close-quarters fighting in Kut .
And an Army soldier investigating a destroyed tank in central Iraq was killed by friendly fire when he was mistaken for an Iraqi , the military said .
U.S. defense officials also were investigating whether a Navy Hornet jet that crashed Wednesday was shot down by a U.S. Patriot missile .
The Navy was searching for the pilot Thursday .
The overall toll of American troops dead passed 50 , and Bush visited a Marine camp , which has lost 13 -- more than any other installation .
``He &apos;s in heaven , &apos; &apos; the commander in chief told the family of one fallen Marine in a private moment .
To the cheers of thousands earlier in a speech , he vowed victory , and said , ``A vise is closing on the regime . &apos; &apos;
Iraqi officials issued the latest in a series of exhortations in Saddam &apos;s name .
``Fight them with your hands .
God will disgrace them , &apos; &apos; they said , referring to invading American and British troops .
But the daily urgings seemed increasingly at odds with the military situation across the country , and Myers said Saddam had lost control of 45 percent of Iraq &apos;s territory .
As conventional units fought their way to the outskirts of the capital , officials said special forces had raided the Tharthar presidential palace near Tikrit , Saddam &apos;s hometown .
``That &apos;s all right , he added , ``there &apos;s other operations ongoing . &apos; &apos;
Iraqis had held the town for 13 years .
Die-hard defenders have held out for days inside the city of 1.3 million .
American officials cited continuing examples of Iraqis cooperating with invading troops .
American and British helicopters and planes bombed positions in Kut , and Marines and Iraqis lobbed grenades at close quarters .
Between 10 and 15 Iraqis armed only with rifles charged Marine tanks in the suicide charge .
Two U.S. Marines died in the fighting -- and a medic who tried to save one of them sorrowfully buried his resuscitation equipment on the spot .
Many more Iraqi soldiers surrendered to the overwhelming force of the Americans , and were shuttled to the rear .
He said an investigation was under way .
Toyota Motor Corp. said Tuesday it will promote Akio Toyoda , a grandson of the company &apos;s founder who is widely viewed as a candidate to some day head Japan &apos;s largest automaker .
Considered a candidate for future Toyota president , Toyoda oversees its China business , a critical market for the automaker .
Toyoda has been on the star track for years .
When he joined the board in 2000 , he was its youngest member .
Under a reform led by President Fujio Cho , the membership of Toyota &apos;s board of directors will be slashed to 27 from 58 .
Executive vice presidents will be reduced to seven from nine .
The new system is designed to ``speed up decision-making and operations , &apos; &apos; Toyota spokesman Shigeru Hayakawa said .
Toyota &apos;s top posts held by Cho and Chairman Hiroshi Okuda remain unchanged .
Kiichiro Toyoda founded the automaker in 1937 , transforming the loom manufacturer started by his father into an automaker .
Meanwhile , the U.S. military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed three foreign journalists .
The strike destroyed three nearby houses and killed at least two people .
U.S. Marines battled snipers as they fought deeper into the capital from the east .
They seized the Rasheed Airport and captured enough ammunition for an estimated 3,000 troops .
Ominously , they also took a prison where they found U.S. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suits possibly belonging to American POWs .
Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guard headquarters inside the capital .
Others discovered a 12-room complex inside a cave , complete with white marble floors and fluorescent lighting .
Members of the U.S. Army &apos;s V Corps opened up a new front by entering Baghdad from the north .
The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans first penetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown .
Iraqi officials , however , remained defiant , saying Iraq &apos;s forces would never surrender to American forces : ``They will be burnt , &apos; &apos; said Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf .
In central Baghdad , a Reuters cameraman and a cameraman for Spain &apos;s Telecinco died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel .
Tareq Ayyoub , a journalist with Al-Jazeera , died when a U.S. warplane bombed the Arab-language satellite television &apos;s office .
An Abu Dhabi TV office in Baghdad also was hit .
Al-Jazeera categorically denied that its Baghdad bureau had been used by Iraqi forces to fire on U.S. troops .
Associated Press photographer Jerome Delay said he watched from the top floor of the hotel as American tanks took up positions on the bridge .
``All the shooting was concentrated on the bridge and across the river , &apos; &apos; where U.S. forces were located , he said .
It was not clear whether any Iraqi leader had been killed in the airstrike targeting Saddam in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood .
Iraqi rescue workers pulled two bodies from the rubble but said the toll could be as high as 14 .
``I don &apos;t know whether he survived , &apos; &apos; U.S President George W. Bush said of Saddam at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
``The only thing I know is that he &apos;s losing power . &apos; &apos;
Iraq &apos;s U.N. ambassador , Mohammed Al-Douri , said Tuesday he believes that Saddam is alive , although al-Douri acknowledged he has not communicated with Baghdad .
Bush and Blair sought to minimize their differences over who should govern and rebuild Iraq .
Blair favors a stronger U.N. role than Bush .
``There will be a vital role for the U.N. in the reconstruction of Iraq , &apos; &apos; Blair said .
``But the key is that Iraq in the end will be run by the Iraqi people . &apos; &apos;
In northern Iraq , Kurdish forces tightened their ring around Kirkuk on Tuesday , following heavy coalition airstrikes on Iraqi fronts .
Kurdish militia took control of Sekamian plateau , about 10 kilometers ( six miles ) north of Kirkuk , Kurdish media reported .
The area affords a commanding view of the city and the vast oil fields of Iraq &apos;s No. 2 oil region .
The U.S. military said two planes had been lost .
U.S. Central Command said the pilot ejected , was recovered by ground forces and was in good condition .
A U.S. F-15E jet fighter also went down early Monday and a search was under way for its two-man crew , the military announced Tuesday .
Officials did not say whether the plane was shot down or crashed accidentally .
The dictator Suharto has fallen , the constitution has changed , the media was unshackled , democratic elections held , and East Timor freed .
After Sept . 11 , 2001 , Indonesia was quick to sign onto U.S. President George W. Bush &apos;s global war on terror .
Frustrated , Jakarta &apos;s generals are looking elsewhere to replace antiquated arsenals .
Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travels to Moscow to seek the Kremlin &apos;s help in modernizing her increasingly obsolete 300,000-member armed forces .
She is also likely to open the way for Russian companies to vie for lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector , long dominated by American and British resource giants .
Although opposite ends of the Earth , Indonesia and Russia have some basic things in common .
Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic populations .
Both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule .
Both are resource-rich , but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption .
And , currently , both have opposed the U.S.- led war on Iraq .
Indonesia &apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says Megawati &apos;s meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis .
But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms sales .
Analysts worry that Indonesia &apos;s military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago , allowing for easy infiltration by extremists .
Last year &apos;s Bali bombings , which killed 202 people , illustrated the threat of terrorism in Indonesia .
And , broad opposition to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists .
Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented .
The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country &apos;s main weapons supplier , and annual arms sales peaked at US $ 400 million in the 1980s .
In 1991 , however , the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor .
In 1999 , East Timor became free , but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum .
The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia .
So far , U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program .
But that &apos;s far from enough for Indonesia &apos;s generals .
``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth it , &apos; &apos; said Juwono Sudarsono , a former defense minister .
``So they want to look for alternative sources for planes , helicopters and other hardware . &apos; &apos;
Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as a customer .
``Replenishing them has been a big problem , &apos; &apos; Sudarsono said .
But neighboring Malaysia &apos;s success in integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F / A-18 Hornets persuaded them otherwise , Sudarsono said .
If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue , it is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged .
Whatever happens , Indonesia , a mainly Muslim but politically secular state , is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy .
What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia &apos;s economic ambitions .
Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to dlrs 203.5 million in 2001 -- the last year for which statistics are available .
Analysts say this can only grow .
The real concerns , though , are in the petroleum sector .
But some Shiite Muslim groups boycotted the meeting and thousands protested nearby .
A 13-point statement released after the meeting stressed the need to work toward a democratic Iraq built on the rule of law and equality .
It also called for dissolving Saddam &apos;s Baath Party but left open the question of separating church from the state .
White House envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told delegates that the United States has ``no interest , absolutely no interest , in ruling Iraq . &apos; &apos;
``We want you to establish your own democratic system based on Iraqi traditions and values , &apos; &apos; Khalilzad said .
``I urge you to take this opportunity to cooperate with each other . &apos; &apos;
Participants included Kurds , Sunnis and Shiites from inside the country and others who spent years in exile .
U.S. officials invited the groups , which picked their own representatives .
Many Iraqis boycotted the meeting in opposition to U.S. plans to install Garner atop an interim administration .
``Iraq needs an Iraqi interim government .
U.S. officials hope more Iraqis join the process and stressed that this was just the first of many such meetings in Iraq .
The meeting concluded with the delegates voting by show of hands to meet again in 10 days .
A national conference is planned to select the interim administration , perhaps within weeks , a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity .
``That full electoral process may well take longer . &apos; &apos;
Tuesday &apos;s meeting was the first step toward that goal after the ouster of Saddam .
Sheik Ayad Jamal Al Din , a Shiite religious leader from Nasiriyah , urged the delegates to craft a secular government , according to a pool report .
But Nassar Hussein Musawi , a schoolteacher , disagreed : ``Those who would like to separate religion from the state are simply dreaming , &apos; &apos; he said .
``Saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessary for people to sell off personal possessions , &apos; &apos; Mukhliss said .
``Now it &apos;s time to take our country back . &apos; &apos;
There are already tensions between the United States and some Iraqi factions .
Iraqi opposition leaders fear the United States is trying to force Ahmed Chalabi , head of the London-based umbrella Iraqi National Congress , on them as leader of a new Iraqi administration .
U.S. officials said Chalabi was brought in because he offered forces to the coalition .
Neither Chalabi nor many other leaders of anti-Saddam groups attended Tuesday &apos;s meeting , but they sent delegates .
Iraqis protesting the conference said it did not represent their interests .
The protesters held banners written in English and Arabic saying the ``Hawza , &apos; &apos; or the Shiite religious seminary in Najaf , represents them .
Even some of those at the meeting said they did not want Garner leading the interim administration .
``We will press for any Iraqi civilian administration regardless of what the Americans say .
An administration by Garner is not acceptable , &apos; &apos; said Mowaffak al-Rubaie , an Iraqi physician and opposition activist .
He said American officials have outlined what Garner &apos;s administration would look like : Each ministry would be headed by an American , either military or civilian .
Associated Press writer Patrick McDowell in Kuwait City contributed to this report .
Grigory Pasko &apos;s lawyer Genri Reznik filed the appeal with Russian Supreme Court , the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported .
He asked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against Pasko , they said .
Pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there .
A military court said he intended to pass the notes to Japanese media with which he had worked .
Pasko , whose sentence included time served , was released in January for good behavior after serving more than two-thirds of the sentence .
He has maintained his innocence , saying the military was punishing him for exposing environmental abuses by the Russian navy , including the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea .
Reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pasko was freed never reached the presidium of the Supreme Court , according to Interfax .
The lawyer said the court &apos;s military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal .
``The way it works is that there have been an initial set of contracts let to US companies , since it &apos;s U.S. money .
Those companies can subcontract to any company they want , &apos; &apos; Elizabeth Jones said .
She made the statements after a meeting with the speaker of the Portuguese parliament , Joao Mota Amaral .
``The U.S. government has done what it is going to do : it has opened up the process to international companies .
We can &apos;t direct commerce , &apos; &apos; Jones said .
``Once it &apos;s a commercial proposition , then international bidding processes come into effect . &apos; &apos;
Jones met with Defense Minister Paulo Portas on Tuesday and will meet Foreign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving Portugal Wednesday .
Many are hoping to reap benefits from Portuguese government support of the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein .
Also , Portugal hosted a last ditch pre-war summit in the Azores islands for leaders of the United States , Britain and Spain .
Rudolph Giuliani will wed his companion , Judith Nathan , on May 24 in the ex-mayor &apos;s old home , Gracie Mansion .
The news was announced Thursday by Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel .
His successor , Mayor Michael Bloomberg , will perform the ceremony .
``We were close already , &apos; &apos; Giuliani said .
``And then we went through hell together . &apos; &apos;
Giuliani and Nathan began appearing in public together in May 2000 .
Soon after , he announced that he and Hanover were moving toward legal separation .
During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce , a judge ruled that Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion , the official mayoral residence , as long as Giuliani &apos;s children lived there .
Giuliani and Hanover have two teenage children , Andrew and Caroline .
The divorce settlement called for Giuliani to pay Hanover more than $ 6.8 million .
Hanover , 53 , is host of a syndicated television show , ``Famous Homes and Hideaways . &apos; &apos;
Giuliani &apos;s first marriage to his second cousin , Regina Peruggi , lasted about 14 years .
Nathan divorced wallpaper salesman Bruce Nathan in 1992 .
They have a teenage daughter .
The Giuliani-Nathan nuptials will be a first for Bloomberg , who is making an exception from his policy of not performing weddings , said Bloomberg spokesman Ed Skyler .
Giuliani regularly officiated at weddings while in office .
``The mayor is honored by their request , &apos; &apos; Skyler said .
No one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident .
DPRK stands for the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Korea , the North &apos;s official name .
The announcement came as U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun were about to meet Wednesday in Washington to discuss North Korea &apos;s nuclear programs .
The accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which North Korea was banned from developing atomic arms .
In January this year , North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , a global accord to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons .
In December , a shipment of North Korean missiles bound for Yemen was briefly stopped in the Arabian Sea .
It also revived its claim that the U.S. military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea , turning the country into ``the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East . &apos; &apos;
Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis , although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option .
North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK , &apos; &apos; KCNA said .
``It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project and come forward as a responsible member of the international community , &apos; &apos; he said .
``When the North takes this route , the Republic of Korea and the international community will extend the necessary support and cooperation . &apos; &apos;
Julianne Lee , a Roh spokeswoman , said the North Korean statement might be a negotiating ploy in the wake of talks last month with U.S. officials in Beijing .
North Korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for security guarantees and economic aid , according to U.S. officials .
The nuclear crisis flared in October , when Washington said North Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 treaty with Washington .
On the eve of a visit to the Saudi capital , Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said security at the Australian embassy appeared to be sufficient .
``We have quite a substantial security presence at the Australian embassy in Riyadh and the ambassador thinks that that security presence is sufficient , &apos; &apos; Downer told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Australia is one of Washington &apos;s staunchest allies .
Canberra sent troops to fight in the war on terror in Afghanistan and alongside U.S. and British forces in Iraq .
New Zealand also has no immediate plans to close its Saudi embassy .
More than 100 FBI agents and explosives experts are expected in Yemen by the end of the weekend to investigate the suspected terrorist attack .
A team of special Naval engineers will work on recovering the bodies of ten sailors listed as missing and presumed dead .
Officials suspect a suicide bombing caused the blast , which tore a 40 foot hole in the hull of the destroyer .
Pentagon sources say an early examination finds 400 to 500 pounds of explosives may have been used .
There are no confirmed suspects yet , but officials say several Middle East groups are expected to be investigated .
The president proposed the talks in a call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Mr. Clinton says he wants to see Arafat and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak abide by promises to end the bloodshed made at last week &apos;s emergency summit in Egypt .
A White House spokesman says Arafat is reviewing the offer .
Meanwhile , some 30,000 anti-Israeli protesters clashed with police in Jordan .
Demonstrators from across the country traveled to a west bank border town to call for the return of Palestinian refugees .
The number of police and protesters who were injured is still not known .
A verdict handed down three years ago today brought debate from both sides of the Atlantic .
In this edition of &quot; Headliners , &quot; Bob Glascoff has the story of British au pair Louise Woodward and finds out what she &apos;s doing now .
October 1997 .
Louise Woodward is sentenced to life in prison on charges she murdered an infant boy .
Woodward , then a 19-year-old au pair from Britain , was accused of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen by shaking him and slamming his head .
The case attracted widespread attention in England , where many thought she was innocent .
Woodward had been living with the Eappen family taking care of their two young sons .
Despite receiving a life sentence , her charges were reduced two weeks later from second-degree murder to manslaughter .
She was sentenced to time served and released .
Woodward returned to Britain in 1998 to another controversy .
Her parents were accused of defrauding her defense fund .
They went on trial this year and were acquitted .
Today , Woodward is studying to be a lawyer .
With &quot; Headliners , &quot; I &apos;m Bob Glascoff .
The Navy now says it will cost about $ 240 million to get the &quot; USS Cole &quot; up and running again .
Officials originally estimated it would cost $ 150 million to repair the gaping hole in the ship &apos;s midsection .
But a Naval official says that does not include the cost of replacing equipment and weapons damaged in the attack carried out by suicide bombers in Yemen .
The ship is scheduled to arrive in Mississippi in about ten days .
Russia &apos;s Presidential Clemency Commission is advising president Vladimir Putin to release convicted American spy Edmund Pope on humanitarian grounds .
A top Putin aide says Pope could be home by Christmas .
However , according to Russian law , Putin cannot issue a pardon any earlier than December .
Pope was convicted of espionage Wednesday in Moscow and sentenced to 20 years in prison .
He suffers from a rare form of bone cancer and has asked Putin to let him return to the U.S. to receive medical care .

The damaged &quot; USS Cole &quot; comes home today .
It &apos;s due to arrive in Pascagoula , Mississippi , this morning .
The destroyer was christened there five years ago .
Repairs are expected to cost about $ 240 million .
Yemeni and U.S. authorities are still investigating the October bombing .
17 sailors were killed .
Yemen &apos;s Prime Minister says at least three Yemenis will go on trial next month in connection with the attack .
They &apos;re suspected of belonging to an international terrorist network .
U.S. and Yemeni officials have released a photo of one of the suicide bombers killed in the attack on the &quot; USS Cole &quot; in the port of Aden October .
17 U.S. sailors were killed and 39 others hurt .
The officials say Yemeni national Hussan Saeed Awad Al-Khamri was described by a boy as having launched the boat used in the attack .
Six possible suspects are still being held in Yemen pending a trial that could start as early as next month .
Investigators say they &apos;re still looking for other key suspects .
Many people in North America will be able to experience a partial solar eclipse tomorrow .
But scientists say it won &apos;t block much Christmas sunlight in most places .
As always , eclipse fans are being warned not to look directly at the Sun because that can cause permanent eye damage .
The eclipse will occur at around 12 P.M. Eastern Time .
The best view will be in the Northeast .
Welcome all to my new site .
I &apos;ve decided to incorporate my old work blog into a general blog , the work diary is up on the right titled &quot; my work diary &quot; .
EFF YEAH !
BUSH WON !
OK then .
My next thought .
The world is a much better place now that the terrorist Yassar Arafat is dead .
Here is a good one minute video on his great legacy Here .
Because of him millions of palestinians chose &quot; jihad &quot; over peace with Isreal .
He innovated suicide bombers and plane hijacking plus he embezzelled hundreds of millions of dollars from aid funds .
... and this guy got a nobel peace prize , what a disgrace .
UPDATE 1 - Drudge is reporting that Arafat has been skimming 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories .
MAG : Arafat Skimmed $ 2 Million a Month From the Gas Trade Sun Nov 14 2004 09 : 53 : 40 ETNew York .
It &apos;s the most successful financial reform in the Arab world , -- Jim Prince , president of the Los Angeles-based Democracy Council and head of the audit team , tells TIME .
People close to Fayyad &apos;s investigation told TIME of Arafat &apos;s skimming from the gas trade .
Breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruption boosted the Palestinian Authority &apos;s official treasury by $ 10 million a month and cut gas prices for ordinary Palestinians .
In the mid-1990s , Arafat controlled a financial empire worth at least $ 3 billion .
By the time of his death , he was down to his last $ 1 billion , according to Israeli-intelligence estimates .
Top Palestinian officials say Suha wants the new chief of the P.L.O. , Mahmoud Abbas , and Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qurei to give her money out of the P.L.O. &apos; s party coffers .
But a senior P.L.O. official tells TIME , &quot; they &apos;ll pay her a pension , and that &apos;s it . &quot;
People familiar with Arafat &apos;s finances say the Palestinian leader sent Suha $ 200,000 a month out of the Palestinian Authority &apos;s budget for the Office of the President .
Senior Palestinian security officials tell TIME that Arafat also shipped money to the gunmen of the Aqsa Martyrs Brigades .

.. Sure sounds like a Nobel Prize winner to me .
Thank god Bush is still our president , although I strongly disagree with him on his new immigration policy .
This policy would just make it easier for the enemy to get within our borders .
Thanks to Captain Ed for bringing this up .
Apparently James Baker , former Secretary of State and current envoy for the Bush Administration , has asked the Isreali government to release a scumbag terrorist to promote &quot; peace &quot; .
Gotta say that this shocked me , I &apos;ve always thought Mr. Baker was a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap .
Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada in 1987 , leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank .
During the uprising , he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan , where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994 .
In 1996 , he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council , in which he advocated peace with Israel , sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat .
The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the General Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank .
However , as the Second Intifada began , Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia .
This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad , responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings .
Under Barghouti , the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs &apos; Brigades .
What is he thinking ?
Release a known terrorist to run the PLO and that will bring about peace , give me a effin break .
This recent news story is troubling in many different ways .
When I first heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmas from the West to East coast .
Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash .
A federal law enforcement official , who declined to be identified by name , said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity .
But pilots are troubled by the incidents , and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons .
&quot; It &apos;s not some kid , &quot; said Paul Rancatore , a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots Association .
&quot; It &apos;s too organized . &quot;
Loren Thompson , who teaches military technology at Georgetown University , called it a &quot; rather worrisome development , &quot; though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed .
&quot; What we &apos;re talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft , &quot; Thompson said .
&quot; That &apos;s not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store . &quot;
Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBI suspects would be &quot; fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents , &quot; Thompson said .
Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers .
Lots of people think that these indeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree .
These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as high as 8500 feet .
To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal-mart .
In my opinion this is quite alarming .
They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen , but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage . &quot;
PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also .
Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat .
However , these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports .
American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle .
It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush .
Why you ask ?
But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .
From a European perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House .
One is the death of Yasser Arafat .
No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute .
That another reason why I respect Bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat .
May he rot in hell .
A second reason is Europe &apos;s growing worries about Islamic terrorism .
The murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe &apos;s 9 / 11 .
You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ?
Get outta here .
... Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9 / 11 to cry about .
The third force is the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that kept the trans-Atlantic alliance together for half a century .
The Russian bear is growling again .
They should be very worried about this item , I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was .
Hopefully our Government isn &apos;t asleep at the wheel with this situation either .
There is a personal edge to all this .
Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor , there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan .
Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history : that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House .
His thumping re-election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion .
Strangely enough , this has been Tony Blair &apos;s strategy all along ; it is rapidly becoming the Continent &apos;s strategy , too .
Couldn &apos;t of ended that article any better myself .
Get used to it France , we ain &apos;t going nowhere .
Gotta hate the French , I really don &apos;t think there is anything good you can say about the French anymore , they are a waste and a joke of a government .
Apparently Bush wants the European &apos;s to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist group .
Makes sense right ?
The United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria , Hezbollah &apos;s main sponsors .
The American rift with Syria deepened this week , with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon &apos;s former prime minister in Beirut on Monday .
Gotta love that .
The Palestinian president admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f-wad terrorists but the French don &apos;t agree .
No joke .
The Europeans are not solidly opposed to listing Hezbollah as a terrorist group , the officials said .
One European diplomat said other countries were &quot; hiding behind &quot; France on the issue .
The group could reach no consensus , the diplomat said .
&quot; Nothing is going to change on Hezbollah because we don &apos;t have an agreement among the member states , &quot; the diplomat said .
&quot; That doesn &apos;t mean we won &apos;t get a consensus .
I know the Americans are impatient , but the European Union has 25 states , and these things take time . &quot;
Some of those interviewed tried to make it sound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush is because of the situation in Lebanon .
But as The Captain points out , it probably has more to do with Iran .
I suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the &quot; delicate &quot; nature of Lebanese politics , but from the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranians .
The EU has tried for the past two years to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up their nuclear-weapons ambitions to little avail .
They don &apos;t want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs &apos; terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly .
They did not learn from Hitler &apos;s Germany I guess , they tried to appease that guy too .
This whole thing just reminds me how corrupt and useless France is .
They will forever be known as that corrupt and cowards in my opinion .

Nicolae Mischie , authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party , has been jailed .
Romania voted in the last December , ousting the so-called socialist party PSD ( Social-Democratic Party ) .
PSD managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas , with the help of people like Mischie .
E.g. , Mischie , who talks like an idiot , got a PhD in history .
His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper &apos;s subject lived .
Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities , which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania .
PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader .
It is known that communist leaders die in office ( as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court ) and Ion Iliescu won &apos;t be different .
All the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party , that &apos;s the untold truth that Romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet .
Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders , because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area .
But Mischie was wrong , because he did that while in vacation in Switzerland , where you can &apos;t go if you earn 20K $ a year .
The new power had nothing to do , but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago .
Iliescu and Nastase , ex-president and ex-prime minister , are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority .
If Mischie wouldn &apos;t take his chance on them , he would still be free , with the help of the weak and weakening strings Iliescu might still pull .
Gazprom , the main Russian gas company , has been denied a $ 10 billion credit line due to the political situation in Russia .
But the markets have caught on , and Russia may be deprived of the capital it needs to grow .
Don &apos;t expect any of the Russian leadership to reverse course ; given the current trends there , they &apos;ll just Blame the West when their screwy plan screws them over .
One of the rules of thumb that has guided my ( limited ) business career from the beginning is that China is never as lucrative as it looks .
This assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history , including several booms in interest and investment in China .
Their biggest problem : There &apos;s usually a 200-to-1 ratio of Nearly Starving Peasant Laborers to Absurdly Well-Off Government Employees .
And now it &apos;s an iffier 100-to-1 , since there are also rich private sector employees and the labor force isn &apos;t quite so expendable .
What they &apos;ve been missing for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy : Consumers .
Specifically , they didn &apos;t have a real middle class .
That &apos;s changed in the last twenty years , as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made China a genuine , rather than theoretical , contender .
And they &apos;ve even supplied proof of their economic viability , announcing that they &apos;ve beaten Japan for exports to the US .
If only I &apos;d figured this out in early 2002 , when their stock market was by some stretch of the imagination cheap .
I dunno if you want anything to do with their stock market .
For one , its perforance last year was pretty dismal .
More importantly , its a structural nuthouse .

Finally , the Shanghai Composite on July , 1997 was trading at 1189.76 .
As of January 27 , 2005 it &apos;s sitting at 1225.89 .
That &apos;s an annualized return of roughly 0.4 % .
The 5 year return is even worse ( http : / / finance.yahoo.com / q / bc ? s = ^ SSEC &amp; t = 5y ) .
You haven &apos;t missed much : ) .
As of this morning , at least .
Anyway , it looks like they &apos;re denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you &apos;d think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out .
Apparently Carly made a lot of journalistic enemies during her six hears at HP .
This is getting a little harsh ; she might have messed up at HP ( I refuse to call it by the new name , for now ) , but she wasn &apos;t actively trying to destroy a great company and wreck the shareholders .
It just , well , happened .
So , right , Carly was a bad manager , and she eventually got what she deserved , but she isn &apos;t evil incarnate .

They develop lots of new technology , but nobody can tell who owns what .
And , of course , their securities laws and property rights are even flimsier than China &apos;s -- after the Putin administration mugged Yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone , they lost a lot of trust .
Still , they have an unbelieveable amount of untapped potential .
An investigation is under way into a fatal airliner accident in Mexico last night .
It happened as the DC-9 was trying to land during a rainstorm .

Four people on the ground were killed .
But the 83 people aboard the plane escaped with only scrapes and bruises .
We have been here so many times before the threat of a wider war in the middle east .
There has been impressive progress but a lasting past remains elusive .
President Clinton today considered flying to the middle east for an emergency summit meeting , but he backed away .
How did it come to this so swiftly ?
Here &apos;s Andrea Mitchell .
Reporter :
The president returns to Washington today , hoping to salvage something from eight years of Middle East diplomacy .
What went wrong ?
To many peace seemed so close at Camp David in July .
How did it all fall apart ?
First , Palestinian resentment .
The prime minister moved forward more from his initial position than chairman Arafat , particularly surrounding the questions of Jerusalem .
It &apos;s quite clear the Palestinians do not accept the various proposals put forward to divide Jerusalem .
Reporter :
Arafat appears weak , and radical groups like Hamas gain strength .
A weakened Arafat emboldens a great deal of forces that does not want peace .
Reporter :
Second , Israeli frustration .
Many Israelis feel Barak goes too far by offering Arafat partial control of the holy sites , gets nothing in return .
I think Barak was very forthcoming at Camp David .
The intransigence or failure of Arafat to come forward with any counterproposal I think frustrated the prime minister and frustrated the Israelis .
Reporter :
Finally , the summit raises false hopes , is not well prepared by Washington .
The U.S. rushes ahead , eager for a breakthrough before the end of Clinton &apos;s term .
Other Arab leaders like Mubarak of Egypt and Fahd of Saudi Arabia are not sold on the deal , tell Arafat to hold out .
If a concerted effort was put together to consult with these people and bring them on board , then probably Arafat would have been able to cut a deal .
I think the United States did not prepare adequately for Camp David .
They should have been much more careful in the preparation and more assured of getting some kind of an agreement .

It &apos;s a far different river now than it once was , and the question is -- should it be allowed to return to its true form ?
NBC &apos;s national correspondent is Jim Avila .
Reporter :
The wide Missouri , pioneers called it -- too thick to drink , too thin to plow .
A shallow , slow moving , swampy river that birds and fish loved in its natural state .
The ebb and flow in a river like the Missouri provides the basis for life itself .
Reporter :
But the Missouri is no longer wild , tamed by dams and dredging .
Now a shipping highway the government says endangers the very existence of three critical river species -- the 100 million-year-old Pallid Sturgeon , the shore-wading the Least Tern .
The Missouri &apos;s natural rhythm destroyed , say the experts , by six dams in a system from north central Montana to the Mississippi River .
A transformation turning the meandering river into essentially a deep water ditch .
Without providing the higher flow in the spring and the lower flow in the summer that Missouri river species are adapted to , they &apos;re going to disappear .
Re-creating the original river by releasing more water in spring , less in summer -- fighting words for downriver farmers and barge operators .
Try explaining that times have changed , nonsense to the people who live along the Missouri river and don &apos;t want to go back to the spring floods .
Reporter :
It &apos;s about the water and who controls it .
The Missouri , second longest river in the country .
7 states , 2,500 miles long and now according to conservationists , second on the list of rivers in danger .
Farmers say it &apos;s the planting season that &apos;s in danger if the Missouri isn &apos;t controlled in spring .
And barge owners say two dry months in the summer will ruin business .
What this proposal does is double the cost of operation on the Missouri river and will cause those companies to move off the river .
Reporter :
16.7 million bushels .
That &apos;s .3 % .
The barge companies do not own the Missouri river .
The flood plain farmers do not own the Missouri river .
Everybody owns it .
We have to find a way to share the Missouri .
Reporter :
And say environmentalists save three threatened species and a leisure economy dependent upon a wide , untamed Missouri .

Grief engulfed Austria , one day after a fire in a cable car filled with skiers killed at least 155 people .
It happened inside a tunnel high in the Austrian Alps .
Here &apos;s NBC &apos;s Ron Allen .
Major Drew Stathis and his 8-year-old daughter say they might have been trapped , but they were just five minutes behind the group .
In the Army you kind of expect , prepare yourself .

Lieutenant Mike Coe got tired of waiting for a train and left a family of four Americans who died , standing in line .
It is horrifying what happened to them .
And it is horrifying how close I was to -- I mean , I guess I &apos;m a good , impatient American who did not want to wait in line .
Today this Alpine resort town came to an abrupt halt as more than 150 victims were all but positively identified .
Friends and relatives who &apos;d been waiting and hoping were taken to a private memorial service .
Up the mountain the usually packed ski areas were completely deserted .
Investigators still haven &apos;t figured out what caused this disaster .
Several eyewitnesses have told them they saw flames coming from the train as it headed up the mountain , before it entered the tunnel .
One official here said , by the time the driver noticed the fire , it already was too late .
The main concern now is to remove and identify the victims .
These Americans ended a holiday weekend burdened by a deep sense of loss .
Nobody is looking forward to the long bus ride with our friends missing .
It &apos;s going to be hard .
Hard for this entire nation mourning the worst disaster here that anyone can remember .

An apparent attack on a US warship has left at least six American sailors dead and about 35 injured .
The explosion came as the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole was refueling at a port in Yemen .
NPR &apos;s Chad Pergram reports .
Both the White House and the Pentagon said the attack appeared to be an act of terrorism .
President Clinton immediately whisked to the region investigative teams from the FBI , the Pentagon and the State Department .
The attack comes as US forces in the Middle East have been placed on a heightened state of alert after days of clashes between Israelis and Palestinians .
Defense Secretary William Cohen said the US would continue to protect its interests around the globe .
No one should doubt our resolve to remain a force for peace and for stability and no one should assume that they can force us to retreat .
No one should assume they can attack us with impunity .
The Cole had just arrived in the harbor for a refueling stop .
Officials say men aboard this small boat had been assisting the Cole with mooring lines just before the blast .

Britain &apos;s going to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea .
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook made the announcement on his arrival in the South Korean capital , Seoul .
But Cook says establishing ties with North Korea doesn &apos;t mean London will turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in the country .
We have diplomatic relations around the world , we are going to find out who is a human rights breaker , we have very deep and very real concerns .
Cook says the South Korean leadership is keen on international help in bringing its northern neighbor in from the cold .
Britain said today that it is normalizing relations with North Korea .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the decision a historic breakthrough .
It comes just days ahead of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright &apos;s trip to the North Korean capital Pyongyang .
Britain &apos;s foreign minister Robin Cook , who made the announcement , said opening diplomatic links could help ease tensions between North and South Korea , technically the two countries are still at war .
Germany said today that it also plans to normalize relations with Pyongyang ,
Selig Harrison is a Korean affairs specialist at the Century Foundation in Washington DC .
Mr. Harrison , Britain , Italy , prior to that Australia , the Philippines now and apparently Germany all bringing the most secretive state into the fold .
How about the United States , where does that leave us ?
Well , I think President Clinton will get some good political cover .
From what Britain has done , if he goes to Pyongyang , as is now being discussed , Secretary Albright is going to go , the number two man in North Korea was in Washington last week .
Things are moving , what &apos;s particularly important is that Britain has not attached any conditions .
The United States has imposed a number of conditions on normalizing with North Korea .
We will want negotiations on some of these contested issues .
It is still shrouded in secrecy , as we said , including in its nuclear weapons program .
Are you trusting of these newly forced alliances , do you consider what Britain is doing either reckless or ill advanced ?
No .
And I don &apos;t think it is an alliance really , it is just conducting diplomatic interchange with them .
It is not even clear how soon Britain is going to have a mission in Pyongyang .
And so I think it certainly isn &apos;t reckless to establish diplomatic relations , and I think indeed it is a very healthy thing because the present leadership of Kim Jong Il , son of the late General You , he has been trying to open up to the outside world .
He doesn &apos;t want to reform his internal economic system or political controls .
On the other hand he needs western capital , he needs supportive international agencies to deal with tremendous economic problems that North Korea has had since the end of the cold war , when they lost their Russian and Chinese economic subsidies .
So that trend of North Korea opening up to the outside , it seems to be , it should be encouraged .
So then as North Korea opens up more and more , what are the possible repercussions down the road for the nearly 40,000 American troops who remain in South Korea ?
Well , North Korea &apos;s attitude has been that if the United States and North Korea are friends and the North Koreans don &apos;t feel threatened , they wont object to some US forces remaining in the Korean peninsula in a new role .
That is to say , if they are going to be there as allies of South Korea against North Korea , then the North Koreans don &apos;t want them there , they will keep putting on the pressure for the US to get the forces out .
The North Koreans are certainly not going to end their missile program , if the US continues to maintain some aspects of its military presence in the Korean peninsula such as its aircraft .
Mr. Harrison , thank you very much for speaking with us .
Thank you .

Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi can be prosecuted in France over the bombing of a French airliner in which a 170 people were killed .
That &apos;s the ruling of a court in Paris .
It rejected an appeal that as a serving head of state Gadaffi should be immune from prosecution .
The lawyer representing the victims &apos; families Francoise Rudetski is hailing the decision as a victory .
The victory today is that any people who committed an act of terrorism should know that he can be pursued and could be arrested and there is no immunity for anyone , any leaders in the world .
Relatives of those killed after an explosion on board the plane over Niger in 1989 , brought the case against the Libyan leader .
Six Libyans including Colonel Gadaffi &apos;s brother-in-law have already been tried in their absence .

Putting aside a half century of acrimony , Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright met today with North Korea &apos;s leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang .
Part of the purpose of this historic visit is to lay the groundwork for a possible trip to North Korea by President Clinton before his term ends .
Albright &apos;s visit to Pyongyang is the first by a high level US official since the communist state was established in 1948 .
Kong Dan Oh is a Korean expert who has just written a book called &apos; North Korea through the Looking Glass &apos; .
She is now in the South Korean capital of Seoul .
We know that the visit is making big news there in Seoul .
Can you tell us what is being reported about the meeting between the two sides from the South Korean perspective ?
Well , when I look at about six major daily newspapers , basically the top news was Madeleine Albright meeting with the Chairman Kim Jong Il .
And basically that indeed this is a very historic event , and some kind of euphoria and very positive upbeat feeling .
But at the same time , the reports are basically telling the importance of this meeting that is that they have to talk about the very critical security matter issues such as missile and nuke .
But nonetheless , the meeting was very crucial , so I think all in all , it was a very positive beginning .
And how much of South Korea as you mentioned is bordering on euphoria , get this new relationship with Pyongyang and at the visit by Secretary of State Albright ?
I know that you have taken a more cautious approach , and I wonder if that applies to Secretary Albright &apos;s visit in general ?
Do you believe that the US is doing the right thing ?
Or is perhaps the United States , in your view , moving too quickly to try and patch things up ?
I think that kind of simple approach to be wrong .
But if she understands importance of this meeting and further brings up substance of issue to be resolved between the North Korea and the United States , I think that is very desirable .
What you &apos;re saying is that you feel that the part of the impetus of the North is influenced by the fact that the United States has a presidential election just a couple of weeks away .
I think that is a definitely correct statement , provided that maybe the Republican candidate , Mr. Bush to be elected .
North Korea was very , very scared that Mr. Bush would take a much more hawkish and conservative approach .
So before this Clinton administration comes to be over , they would like to lay down the ground rules and kind of create some kind of positive improvement to deal with the United States .
And obviously one of the most important agendas for tomorrow is to discuss the possibilities of President Clinton &apos;s next visit sometime in November .
I know that you have concerns about how a potential visit by President Clinton might be portrayed within North Korea itself .
Why is that a concern of yours ?
He is now gambling , he is trying , but he has not really changed his manner or his policy whatsoever .
His economy and his society &apos;s politics is really getting in real deep trouble .
He has to show his power and he &apos;s been telling his people that I am the true leader and the world is afraid of us .
All the imperialist capitalist is afraid of us .
That we are the center of the universe .
Without the North Korea , the globe is not existing .
Let me show you that I am the true leader and they will come to our country to pay visit , courtesy visit for me .
And so now Putin visited , President Kim visited , Jiang Zemin will visit next year and the President Clinton will go .
Domestic consumption of this visit will be immense , without changing any policy toward the freedom of proliferation .
Is it really possible with the kind of close watch that the outside world is now going to be invited to give to North Korea , that Kim Jong Il could actually not change a thing in terms of his policies , internally or externally ?
I am exactly wondering like you , and I think that there is a maybe the possibility actually is going up .
So I don &apos;t object really any of these like U.K. normalization , you know .
I don &apos;t have any objection .

American spy suspect Edmund Pope took the stand again today in a Moscow courtroom .
The former naval intelligence officer faces charges of stealing secret designs for a high-speed Russian torpedo system .
The trial was suspended earlier in the week because of Pope &apos;s poor health .
Pope has a history of bone cancer but a doctor working for the FSB , the Russian security service , pronounced Pope fit enough to stand trial today .
The lawyer Pavel Astakhov says his client is innocent when it comes to espionage .
The whole case as Astakhov claims is an exercise in politics .
This is the first time in almost 40 years that a foreign national is being tried for espionage .
It &apos;s quite blatant .
Officials from the security force , which used to be the KGB , are openly boasting about taking an American citizen to court .
Way back in 1961 US military pilot Garry Powers was tried and sentenced but later on exchanged for a captured Soviet spy .
But Powers was caught red-handed .
His U2 spy plane was brought down by Soviet Air Defenses .
Pope was arrested as he was trying to purchase blue prints for what he says is a 10-year-old underwater propulsion system or as the prosecutions claims ultra modern , secret Russian torpedoes .
Former Russian Army Intelligence Officer , Vitaly Schlykov says Pope could easily have been a victim of the Russian obsession with secrets .
We have of course a secrecy culture in this country for decades and decades and reminisce of it are coming to the surface in this case .
The laws on secrecy are still intact from the times of the Soviet Union .
Guilty or not , Pope is being held under a very harsh regime in the Moscow Lefortovo prison where his wife Sherry visited him last week .
Prison rules say that an inmate can only receive approved gifts on the first and third Thursday in a month .
And Sherry Pope &apos;s short-term visa didn &apos;t enable her to stay that long .
She says she even appealed to the Russian President .
Ed &apos;s mother and I both wrote letters to President to ask him to please take into consideration that Ed is 54 years old and that we want him home .
Military intelligence analyst Vitaly Schlykov says Putin is probably caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the American &apos;s trail .
I &apos;m sure that it came unexpected for Putin .
He wouldn &apos;t have approved on a case like this because politically it is very harmful but he came from the ranks of the FSB himself .
He has to pretend that he is sticking to his guns in this case .
In Schlykov &apos;s opinion , Pope is likely to get convicted .
But he believes that immediately after the sentencing Pope is likely to be pardoned by Moscow .
US Congressman John Peterson , who has been championing Pope &apos;s cause , says he fears that might be too late for Pope .
The main thing we have been pushing for months is health care .
Earlier we had asked for an American doctor to see him .
When they continued to say no then we found Russian doctors .
The judge delayed the trial for a day and a half so we could furnish her with a list of doctors and hospitals in Moscow and after we provided that information she said no .
Pope &apos;s lawyer Pavel Astakhov says that what the authorities here call medical care is a joke .
In Pope &apos;s case medical control means everyday testing for his suspected cancer .
What they do here is take his blood pressure and temperature .
The very least they could do is take blood tests and bone marrow tests .
The court has even rejected our demand for medical expertise to establish whether he is fit to stand trial .
As Strakovs says he does not trust the Judge Nina Barkova at all .
He says she has rejected almost every one of his 40 objections and suggestions during the trail so far .
For The World , this is Nenad Sebek in Moscow .
In Moscow , today there was a dramatic plot twist in a real life courtroom drama .
A lawyer for US spy suspect , Edmond Pope said that the main prosecution witness has retracted his testimony .
According to Pope &apos;s attorney the witness said he provided the evidence under pressure from the Russian Secret Service .
Ever since Pope was arrested 7 months ago , the American businessmen has denied charges that he was gathering secret information on a new high-speed Russian torpedo .
The World &apos;s Nenad Sebek is following the trial in Moscow .
Nenad , go back and tell us just how we got here ?
Who is Edwin Pope and why is he on trial in Russia ?
Well , Edwin Pope is a retired American intelligence officer and that &apos;s sort of speaks against him when it comes to the Russian public and certainly the Russian court .
He has claimed that he is now just an innocent businessman , who was dealing with the Russian businesses orbit in the Defense Industry .
What the Russian prosecution is claiming is that Pope was actually after ultramodern secret high-speed Russian torpedoes .
Okay , so tell us what happened in the trial this morning and bring in this professor from one of Moscow &apos;s elite universities who is a key witness ?
The big news of today was that Pope &apos;s attorney distributed to journalists this morning a letter , which he says was written by Anatoly Babkin , who is a Professor at Moscow &apos;s Bauman Technical Institute , who until now was considered to be the main witness for the prosecution .
He says that he gave that evidence under pressure having had a grave heart condition proceeding a heart attack .
However , the court today again , this is what we were told by Pope &apos;s lawyer , has decided not to accept this change in testimony .
The court said that Professor Babkin had ample opportunities to appear in the court .
What is not clear at this moment is that whether it will allow a personal appearance by Professor Babkin , in which he could sort of say what he said in this letter .
Then I would assume that the Professor is still ailing .
I mean , is he able to take the stand , is there any indication that he will be asked to ?
No he is not able to take the stand at the moment .
He is recuperating after a heart attack , but Pope &apos;s lawyer has said that court session could actually take place in the apartment of Professor Babkin .
We still have to wait and see whether the court will accept that .
So how important is this evidence ?
I mean how pivotal a figure is he ?
Is he providing evidence of no one else can ?
Well .
From what we have heard so far , this is supposed to be like a key witness , a very important witness , but then the first reaction came from the FSB , the Federal Security Bureau , which is the former KGB , they are the ones who are prosecuting Pope .
Their spokesman said today that their evidence is far from being based only on Babkin &apos;s testimony .
He said that FSB has evidence given by other witnesses and experts , as well as , written documents and videos .
This is not , what would know as a standards of American style trial certainly , first of all of the proceedings are conducted entirely in secret .
What is the defense attorney for Edmond Pope saying about the conduct in the trial ?
Well .
He is very unhappy with the main judge .
Pope is not being tried by Jury .
He has been tried by panel of judges headed by judge Nina Barkova and what we have heard from the defense attorney Pavel Astakhov is that she has rejected almost every single one of over 40 objections and suggestions that he has so far submitted during the case .
He is very unhappy with the way she has been conducting the whole case and also with the fact that she has denied Edmund Pope the proper medical attention that he has asked for .
And what has like that it happened should Edmond Pope get convicted .
Would he actually serve time ?
Well .
It was Nenad Sebek in Moscow talking to us about the espionage trial in Moscow of American Edmond Pope .
Thank you very much Nenad .
You are welcome Lisa .
This is PRI , Public Radio International .
A court in Moscow has convicted American businessman Edmund Pope of spying and sentenced him to 20 years in prison .
Pope , a retired naval officer from Pennsylvania , was accused of illegally obtaining secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo .
He argued throughout the case that the information he obtained was already available to the public .
The White House denounced the court action calling it unjustified and wrong .
Pope &apos;s wife and his lawyers have also called for his release on health grounds , saying that he suffers from a rare form of bone cancer , which may have returned during his eight months in a Russian prison .
Corey Flintoff , NPR News , Washington .
A court in Moscow today sentenced American businessman Edmund Pope to 20 years in jail .
Pope , a former naval officer , was found guilty of collecting secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo .
Pope denied the charges and he had a powerful ally .
The Russian court today handed down the maximum sentence .
Still , The World &apos;s Nenad Sebek in Moscow says that Pope has not yet exhausted his legal options .
He has got 7 days to appeal this particular sentence .
There is also the possibility of asking for a presidential pardon , Pope has actually indeed already done that .
It &apos;s just that his wife said that she has not heard neither from the President nor his office .
His health is a big issue as well , isn &apos;t it ?
Yes , Pope has been suffering from a rare bone cancer in the past and he has been consistently complaining about his health ever since last Spring when he was taken in to the Lefortovo prison .
The thing is that he has not been allowed any access to American doctors and even to Russian doctors of his own choosing .
He has been examined by the Russian doctors in the Lefortovo prison but they have just said that his complaints are unfounded and that it might be a case of severe rheumatism or something like that .
They are not sort of allowing the possibility of his bone cancer reoccurring .
That his intentions were innocent to begin with , but the times changed and what he did began to look more and more like espionage .
That is certainly a possibility but we don &apos;t know actually precisely because we don &apos;t even know what the initial charges are .
The whole trial was held behind closed doors and the details of the accusations against Pope have never been fully released .
We know that the prosecution claimed that he was trying to purchase secret plans for a top-secret high-speed Russian torpedo .
That is one of the possibilities .
We have , for example , today &apos;s reaction by General Alexander Zdanovich , he is the head of the FSB support programs .
He was very , very brief in his comments after the sentencing .
He said that the court has said that FSB investigators have acted correctly and in accordance with the law and he says , &quot; Russia has its secrets , we will do our best to protect them &quot; .
Maybe Pope simply ran afoul of such attempts by the Russian Security Services to show that they are doing their job .
Putin , on the one hand , is certainly trying to show that he is in charge and that no one from the outside is going to get away with anything .
By the same token though he is not eager to run afoul of the United States and the State Department is very upset .
Is there any possibility that Mr. Putin might consider a pardon ?
I would say there is a very strong possibility of that .
In a curious way the sentencing of Edmund Pope might be the beginning of an end of this ordeal for him .
But now that this judicial process is over there is a very , very strong likelihood , that &apos;s the feeling here in Moscow that President Vladimir Putin might pardon Edmund Pope .
There is a good reason for that , his ill health .
So it would be a nice humanitarian gesture and a way of offering a friendly hand to the west and to the United States in particular .
The World &apos;s Nenad Sebek in Moscow .
Thanks a lot , Nenad .
You are welcome .
The United States is hoping that Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will follow the advice of his special commission and pardon Edmund Pope .
This week the American businessman began serving a 20-year prison sentence in Moscow after being convicted of spying .
Specifically Russian prosecutors charged that Pope had stolen secrets relating to a high-speed Russian torpedo .
Pope denied the charges and Washington backed him up .
Marsha Lipman is Editor of Moscow based news magazine &apos; Itogi &apos; .
Marsha , did the Presidential Pardons Commission give any reason for their decision ?
It gave several reasons .
He was sentenced to 20 , even though according to the members of the Pardon Commission , the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was far from quotient .
They also said this court did not give the lawyers for the defense due procedure .
The court listened to the defense much less than it did to the prosecution .
How is he going to respond to this and when ?
I don &apos;t think anybody knows and I don &apos;t think anybody will know until President Putin has responded .
It is his decision .
According to the Russian law the Pardon Commission , after it has made its decision , sends it to the President and it &apos;s up to him whether to endorse it or not to say no .
One last question for you , Marsha .
He does have a lot to balance doesn &apos;t he , President Putin ?
Not only the institutions I mentioned but the need to keep things somehow free of tension .
Is this case likely to strain US-Russian relations ?
I &apos;m afraid it might .
Recently the Russian policy toward the US has fallen into a line where Russia tries to demonstrate force it once had but no longer does .
It wants to put an end to what is regarded by the current Russian government as humiliation of the past years .
There is also a scandal that erupted over Russia &apos;s declaration that it will sell weapons to Iran , contrary to the earlier made agreement .
Such examples are quite a few already , some of them are combined with material profits for Russia but not necessarily .
Marsha Lipman is Editor of the Moscow based news magazine &apos; Itogi &apos; .
Marsha , thank you very much for speaking with us .
Pleasure .
Edmund Pope tasted freedom today for the first time in more than eight months .
Pope is the American businessman who was convicted last week on spying charges and sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison .
He denied any wrongdoing .
Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned him for health reasons .
Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein , Germany .
He will spend the next several days at the medical center there before he returns home with his wife Sherry .
Pope was in remission from a rare form of bone cancer when he was arrested in Russia .
Doctors will examine him for signs that the cancer may have come back while he awaiting trial in a Russian jail .
A spokeswoman said that Pope was suffering from malnutrition and high blood pressure .
Congratulations from foreign leaders poured into the governor &apos;s mansion in Texas today .
The messages were addressed to President-elect George W. Bush and they all contained words of welcome and optimism .
But truth be told for most international figures , Bush is something of an unknown .
He has traveled little and his diplomatic experience is limited to contacts with Mexican officials during his tenure as governor .
The World &apos;s Jeb Sharp has been hunting down clues to the foreign policy of the incoming administration .
A few broad foreign policy themes emerged during the campaign .
Chief among them are debate over the wisdom of US intervention .
Bush clearly favors limiting the use of American force and troops to solve conflicts overseas .
Certainly , Condoleezza Rice , certainly Colin Powell who I expect , the two of them to be the dominant force in the next administration on foreign policy .
I certainly think they believe they would like to not intervene as much as the Clinton administration or I guess the previous Bush administration did .
In fact , Condoleezza Rice who is slated to become Bush &apos;s National Security Advisor has already said she &apos;d like to see US troops pulled home from the Balkans .
But , Robert Kagan says its one thing for Bush &apos;s advisors to state a philosophy , its quite another to implement it .
I think they may find the world has a way of intruding itself and that it won &apos;t be that easy to pull forces out of the Balkans for instance , without destroying the NATO alliance .
The Balkans is just one example where the Bush administration will have to walk a fine line in delineating a different approach from that of Mr. Clinton .
The foreign policy challenges facing the next President are daunting .
The Mid East peace process is on hold with Israelis and Palestinians practically at war .
The sanctions regime against Iraq has unraveled .
Russia and China are alarmed at the prospect of America beefing up its missile defenses .
India and Pakistan , now nuclear powers are locked in a dangerous standoff .
Stability in East Asia is another pressing concern .
But despite the challenges , Northeast Asia expert Bates Gil of the Brookings Institution is encouraged by what he knows of the Bush foreign team .
One of the most interesting aspects of the new likely team under the Bush administration is first of all , extensive experience in defense and military affairs .
Secondly , it &apos;s easy to point to a number of persons who will have leading positions who have had extensive experience in East Asian affairs .
So you have a combination of depth of experience plus an understanding of the region .
Both of which will come in handy if there is a crisis with China over Taiwan or relations with North Korea deteriorate .
In such a crisis , Bush is likely to rely on the advice of government officials who cut their teeth during the cold war .
Some critics like Gore advisor Bruce Jentelson worry that the Bush team will be out of step with today &apos;s issues .
Issues related to globalization , global public health , technology , and those challenges .
Yet in my view a truly realistic policy cannot be based only on the old agenda issues , really has to address these new agenda issues as well .
But no matter what sort of expertise Bush &apos;s international affairs people bring to the White House , they won &apos;t be able to fully control what happens on their watch .
Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says each President &apos;s foreign policy is ultimately shaped by events , not theories .
Really , most of a President &apos;s foreign policy comes down to how they respond to specific events .
And the only thing that I &apos;m confident of is that there will be crises .
President-elect Bush is expected to begin naming his top cabinet picks in the next few days .
Those choices will mean everything when the first crisis rolls around .
For The World , I &apos;m Jeb Sharp .
I can &apos;t for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry .
Please , someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers ( Delta , US Airways , Continental , American , Northwestern , United ) .
High fuel costs , insane pension obligations , and a highly paid , specialized workforce .
To this list of woes , we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost structures .
I admit I &apos;ve already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies .
Unfortunately , the pain is not limited to these companies .
Pittsburgh , one of US Airway &apos;s hubs , built up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal .
Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28 % since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely .
These shiny new airports are usually financed by long-term bonds that still have to paid off .
.. but not by the airlines .
This is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy .
Southwest and JetBlue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who knows what will be happening in another five years .
So I will thankfully accept the low fares , bemoan the loss of food on flights , and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy .
BusinessWeek Online has some other commentary about the fare cuts here and about US Airway &apos;s woes here .
Got job ?
And so , I have rejoined the world of the fully employed .
After Christmas , I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses ( at my last full-time job ) .
She was looking for a Development Assistant at the retirement community where she works .
I started here 4 weeks ago .
WM is affiliated with , but not run or fully supported by , the denomination I &apos;ve been a part of all my life ( UMC ) .
My grandmother ( who was Baptist ) lived here for a few months before she died in 1995 , so I have many connections to the job .
Our offices are in one of the patio homes , and I have my own lovely office with a window .
The job &apos;s only about 12 miles from home , and I &apos;m going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and afternoons .
It all seems perfect and yet .
My boss is a very nice person , but conservative and resistant to technology , i.e. computers , internet , etc .
We just got new computers a week and half ago , and she &apos;s griping about XP ( her old OS was Windows 98--mine was 95 , so I &apos;m thrilled with the new stuff ) .
I tell her it &apos;ll just take some getting used to .
We &apos;ll see .
I &apos;m not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get , but it &apos;s the best salary I &apos;ve gotten thus far .
When I was fulltime in radio I made a little less , but I got quite a few remotes , which make up for not getting a topnotch salary .
I &apos;m still doing my TV announcing and my weekend radio stuff , so that money will help .
I &apos;m going to start actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so , too .
My plan is to pay off my car early , and then work on the other debts .
I think it &apos;s time to go on and fill out the adoption applications .
I &apos;m terrified of more debt , but Mom and Dad will help with the money .
I &apos;m not sure they realize how expensive it all is .
I &apos;m thinking we might lean toward adopting from Guatemala , but we &apos;ve still not hashed it all out .
It &apos;s almost bad making some money now , because while most of me wants to save as much as possible , the other , smaller part is screaming loudly for stuff , stuff , stuff ! ! !
I &apos;ve got a trial subscription to XM at work because of the Dell computers , and now I &apos;m lusting to have it all of the time .
G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an aux jack , so I could listen to it here .
He asked if I wanted a car stereo , and I said no , but I do .
There are so many things I want .
A garage .
A dining room set .
New stuff for our house .
New clothes .
New everything .
But I want family more .
I think part of the draw of the other stuff is I could get it now .
But I &apos;d be paying for it later .
Money makes the world go round and round and round til I &apos;m just dizzy .

Meanwhile , there has been continued trouble in the streets of West Bank and the Gaza Strip with at least two more Palestinians killed , Sunday in clashes with Israeli troops .
Laurie Kassman reports the trouble came despite an impassioned plea from Prime Minister Barak that Mr. Arafat rein in the rioters and return to the negotiating table .
On Saturday , Palestinians reported more than 30 injuries .
But reports of the fighting also talked of a drop in the level of violence , since both sides agreed to a cease-fire late Wednesday night .
More than 170 Palestinians have died and more than 6000 are reported to have been wounded in clashes with the Israeli military .
Several Israeli soldiers and civilians have also been killed .
Shopkeepers in East Jerusalem are being urged to close their doors to protest against the killing of two Palestinian teenagers on Friday , Southeast of Jerusalem .
Both Arab and Israeli businesses are suffering from the latest violence .
A shopkeeper in the Arab town of Jaffa , which is adjacent to Tel Aviv , complains that few Israelis venture into the area since clashes erupted there a few weeks ago .
Jaffa is usually bustling with Israeli and foreign tourists .
All our work is dependent totally on the Jews .
If they are not coming , so really we cannot work .
I mean , what happens that the Arabs here , the 20,000 Arabs in is dependent on the Jews going to their market and the Jews coming here .
So we cannot live , I mean , we are really totally paralyzed right now .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have agreed to meet separately with US President Bill Clinton to see how to ease tensions and get the peace process back on track .
The meetings will take place later in the week after the US presidential vote on Tuesday .

US Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to travel next week to nine Middle Eastern Gulf states for meetings with regional leaders .
Mr. Cohen will depart next Tuesday to visit Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Oman , the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Israel , Jordan and Egypt .
The Pentagon says , the Secretary will consult with defense officials in those countries and also visit US troops in the area .
US forces in the Gulf have been on high alert , since last month &apos;s apparent terrorist bombing of the USS Cole , which killed 17 sailors .
An explosion struck the Cole , as it refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrives in Russia today for talks with Vladimir Putin on security , foreign policy , and economic issues .
They are also expected to discuss a new Russian proposal for deep cuts in US and Russian long-range missiles .
VOA &apos;s Larry James in Moscow .
President Clinton has said such a deal is possible , but that it will be first necessary to convince Moscow of the merits of America &apos;s proposed Missile Defense System .
The US wants to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it can develop such a system .
On Sunday Mr. Putin called on the Russian parliament to quickly ratify the amended Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty .
That treaty requires Russia to make further non-nuclear weapons reductions in some areas of the country including breakaway Chechnya .
President Putin acknowledged that Russia is still violating its commitment in Chechnya , but he said it is only a temporary situation which has the ultimate aim of cutting armaments in the region .
He also thanked the 29 other signatories to the treaty for their understanding .
He said Russia is fully behind the agreement that , he said , is an efficient instrument of ensuring security in Europe for years to come .
The original treaty was signed in 1990 and led to the destruction of thousands of heavy weapons by NATO and the former Warsaw Pact .
Tony Blair became the first western leader to come to Russia to meet the new President last March even before Mr. Putin was elected .
The Russian leader returned the favor by making London one of his first foreign destinations after taking office .
The two have already met four times this year .
Analysts here in Moscow believe Britain can play a useful role as a bridge to both Europe and the United States .
Trade is also expected to figure significantly in the talks .
Britain ranks as the third largest investor after the United States and Germany with just slightly more than $ 1 billion invested in Russia .

More than 50 people are dead in Nigeria , after a leaking oil pipeline burst into flames outside the commercial capital , Lagos .
The blast and resulting fire Thursday , ripped through an area near a fuel-loading depot owned by the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation .
Witnesses report seeing burnt bodies littering the charred grounds while many other victims are being treated for injuries sustained in the blaze .
A spokeswoman for the Petroleum Company says the fire was caused by vandals .
Beginning early next year , visitors to Yosemite National Park in California will see some changes .
Under the new plan , visitors will have very limited access to the park by car .
The 343 million-dollar plan will create a new shuttle bus system to alleviate traffic congestion .
It will also remove roads from meadows , create more hiking trails , and restore campsites damaged by a 1997 flood .
Yosemite is not alone in seeking new management strategies to preserve natural areas .
Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona is putting in a light rail system .
And Zion National Park in Utah has just established a new shuttle bus system .

President Clinton has urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to order the release on humanitarian grounds of a US businessman convicted of spying .
A White House spokesman says the two leaders spoke by telephone today , after the Russian government &apos;s pardon commission recommended the release of Edmond Pope .
Earlier , a senior Russian official said Edmond Pope could be home by Christmas .
Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities .
Maybe he didn &apos;t start it , but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today .
The Mahatma , or &quot; great souled one , &quot; instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India .
It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change .
The case of Rosa Parks , the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus , comes to mind as an illustration .
But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign .
The public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience .
It is true that both are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them .
Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking .
They are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute .
Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews .
At best , demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative ; at worst , they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking .
Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile .
Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania .
There are better ways to promote a cause .
Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like .
They say these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause .
The crimes may appear small , but the prices can be huge .
Here are two cases to illustrate .
The protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the authorities carry them away .
Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack .
There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital .
He dies .
The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor , but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal .
Assume that a TV network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience .
The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups .
In a planned protest against his appearance , several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue .
The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige .
The demonstrators have been non-violent , but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute .
Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing .
Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters .
Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly , yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole .
I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country &apos;s call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat .
It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned .
Worse , it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the United States to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in Vietnam .
Finally , I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage .
Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be required .
This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations .
Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ?
In either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience .
If you have not , it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course .
Mr. Agnew was vice president of the U.S. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973 .
As the leading candidate for president of his country in next year &apos;s election , Mario Vargas Llosa ought to be in an enviable position .
But his country is Peru , where political visibility , especially for a believer in democracy and free enterprise -- a right winger in Latin American eyes -- makes a man a target for assassination .
But , after some hesitation , he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about Peru .
And in any case the story takes place a bit earlier than that , when the guerrilla war in the highlands had not yet made internal travel a gamble with destiny .
Even still , the very first sentence of this fable that weaves together Peru &apos;s most advanced and most primitive cultural strands speaks of &quot; my unfortunate country . &quot;
But he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of Peru : its corner of the Amazon jungle .
This narrator is a foil for Mr. Vargas Llosa , a cosmopolitan writer with one well-tailored leg in journalism .
He is in Florence to shake himself free of Peru and get some writing done , just as Mr. Vargas Llosa has gone to Paris and now goes frequently to London for the same purpose .
But this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery , pictures taken in Peruvian Amazonia of the untamed and nomadic Machiguenga tribe .
Saul mysteriously disappears .
This is what we know at the end of the opening section of &quot; The Storyteller . &quot;
The next voice we hear sounds like this : &quot; There was no evil , there was no wind , there was no rain .
The women bore pure children .
If Tasurinchi wanted to eat , he dipped his hand into the river and brought out a shad flicking its tail . . . &quot;
And this : &quot; Moving , walking .
Keeping on , with or without rain , by land or by water , climbing up the mountain slopes or climbing down the ravines . &quot;
The speaker is never identified .
He tells his stories in his majestically simple way , in a &quot; language &quot; all his own .
There are creation myths and cosmologies and hunting stories -- a whole culture is contained within these dreamy narratives .
It is as though Mr. Vargas Llosa had recorded a storytelling session at a Machiguenga campfire .
And this is just the effect he hopes to have on the reader , as he alternates chapters in his &quot; own &quot; voice with chapters somehow &quot; borrowed &quot; from the Machiguenga storyteller .
For most of the book , there is no direct connection between its urban and its Amazonian modes .
But the contrast between them becomes a living thing through the brilliant contrast of narrative styles that Mr. Vargas Llosa creates .
But the joke turns serious when a reportage takes him to Amazonia and he encounters the missionaries who know more than anyone else about the Machiguengas .
The storytellers traveled among the bands , reminding them of their identity .
But why would no Machiguenga the narrator meets during his reportage even admit that there were storytellers ?
The narrator eventually deduces the extraordinary answer , which is confirmed in a literally Kafkaesque manner by a storyteller in the next chapter .
I am trying to give away as little as possible , but this is not really a mystery or some kind of jungle thriller .
It will be read for the brilliant clash of styles of narration and the even more brilliant way that they have been tied together into a large metaphor for literature and its function in society .
It is a peaceful time in this part of western India .
The summer crop is harvested , winter sowing has yet to begin .
Farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons laughing and gossiping at the markets .
One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices .
For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s , the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame .
The Arabs had merely oil .
These farmers may have a grip on the world &apos;s very heart .
Or , at least , its heart disease .
Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed , Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals .
If further research proves the seed &apos;s benefits , this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil .
&quot; The proper climatic conditions don &apos;t exist in many places in the world . &quot;
Arvind Patel , a processor and exporter of the seed , raves : &quot; If psyllium takes the place of oat bran , it will be huge . &quot;
Only one thing is certain here : Pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from Sidhpur for a long time .
Local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek , a legume .
Psyllium is an annual herb , Plantago ovata , that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here , mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal .
As such , the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern India .
&quot; I can assure you , &quot; attests a 25-year-old lawyer in New Delhi , with a meaningfully raised eyebrow , &quot; from personal experience , it works . &quot;
A prominent businessman in Bombay gives a similar testimonial : &quot; I have been taking it daily since 1961 . &quot;
Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney , bladder and urethra problems , duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids .
Some apply it to gouty joints .
The plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and diminutive seeds .
The translucent husk of the seed is removed , sifted and crushed ; the seed itself is fed to animals .
Some 90 % of the crop , which was worth $ 26 million last year , is exported .
For decades , psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as Procter &amp; Gamble Co . &apos; s Metamucil , the top-selling brand in the U.S. , and Ciba-Geigy Corp. &apos; s Fiberall .
But some time ago , researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood .
Cincinnati-based P &amp; G took an interest ; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol .
One of the studies , done at the University of Minnesota , tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels .
In late 1987 , P &amp; G asked the FDA for approval to market Metamucil as the first non-prescription , cholesterol-lowering product in the U.S.
In April , the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded .
In September , Kellogg Co. launched a competing psyllium-fortified cereal called Heartwise .
Suddenly , on television , in advertisements and on their cereal boxes , Americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed .
The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals .
This month , the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday , in various forms , ingest too much psyllium .
Currently , there is a lull in the psyllium war .
The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe .
It also ordered P &amp; G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol .
But the agency hasn &apos;t yanked psyllium off store shelves .
If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium , other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products .
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a sensational thing , &quot; says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P &amp; G in Bombay .
Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel : &quot; I just got back yesterday from the U.S.
In the newspapers , on the radio and TV , psyllium is everywhere . &quot;
But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers .
&quot; Psyllium &apos;s not a good crop , &quot; complains Sooraji Jath , a 26-year-old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura .
&quot; You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined . &quot;
Even at the Basic Chemicals , Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council , the government agency that promotes the seed , the psyllium boom is distant thunder .
In one way , the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves .
They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year .
But there &apos;s a catch .
Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities .
This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop .
Psyllium needs sandy soil , dew during the first few weeks , and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing .
Small crops are grown in Pakistan , France , Spain , Italy , Belgium and Brazil , but their quality can &apos;t compare to that of Indian psyllium .
Big buyers like Procter &amp; Gamble say there are other spots on the globe , and in India , where the seed could be grown .
&quot; It &apos;s not a crop that can &apos;t be doubled or tripled , &quot; says Mr. Krishnamurthy .
But no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop .
In Sidhpur , it is almost time to sow this year &apos;s crop .
Many farmers , too removed to glean psyllium &apos;s new sparkle in the West , have decided to plant mustard , fennel , cumin , fenugreek or castor-oil seeds .
Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel .
&quot; Maybe I &apos;ll plant castor-oil seeds . &quot;
His brother , Parkhaji , whose head is swathed in a gorgeous crimson turban , nods vigorous assent .
And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage .
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do : revive a constituency for the Contra rebels .
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on NBC-TV &apos;s &quot; Meet the Press &quot; that Mr. Ortega &apos;s threat was &quot; a very unwise move , particularly the timing of it . &quot;
Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night .
Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army .
Saturday , he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras .
He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels .
Not only did Mr. Ortega &apos;s comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region , it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections .
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates .
While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega &apos;s threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued .
Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader .
&quot; In these circumstances , I think they &apos;d win . &quot;
Mr. Ortega &apos;s threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves .
He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire .
Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections .
&quot; My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning &quot; by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency , he said .
A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously .
The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in the century ahead .
A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth &apos;s polar ice caps , raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas .
To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen .
These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers said , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change .
But the ice-core samples aren &apos;t definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating , Mr. Thompson acknowledged .
According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely caused by burning of fossil fuels , will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space .
Skeptics say that if that &apos;s the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century , reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide .
Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings .
&quot; Climate varies drastically due to natural causes , &quot; said Mr. Thompson .
But he said ice samples from Peru , Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming .
An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : He has made speaking Filipino respectable .
The 6 1 / 2-foot-tall turtle , Pong Pagong , is a character who stars in the children &apos;s television show &quot; Batibot . &quot;
He speaks only in Filipino .
&quot; Batibot , &quot; which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the U.S. program &quot; Sesame Street , &quot; has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort .
Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show .
Now , she says , &quot; it &apos;s no longer an issue . &quot;
The success of &quot; Batibot &quot; stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language .
Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog , the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country &apos;s principal island of Luzon .
Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country &apos;s elite , who generally prefer English .
There &apos;s also resentment .
Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions .
( There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country . )
What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines .
It is entrenched in the country &apos;s colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography .
As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children .
As a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school .
Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a &quot; language schizophrenia . &quot;
The issue has been simmering for years .
It doesn &apos;t take much to provoke an intense debate .
But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling .
They believe the media , including &quot; Batibot , &quot; have played a crucial role .
According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva , &quot; Batibot &quot; doesn &apos;t set out to advance the cause of Filipino .
&quot; It &apos;s not as if we &apos;re teaching language per se , &quot; he says , &quot; We &apos;re just using it . &quot;
These days , &quot; Batibot &quot; is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment .
It is shown weekdays on two of the country &apos;s five networks .
With an audience totaling more than 400,000 , &quot; Batibot &quot; consistently ranks in the country &apos;s top-four most-watched daytime programs .
But advertising revenue is inadequate .
Periodically , there are threats that the program will fold .
&quot; Batibot &quot; lacks the polish of &quot; Sesame Street . &quot;
Sound stages echo .
Acting sometimes falls flat .
There are only two large puppets in the program : Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing .
But the production is the equal of any local program .
And the show &apos;s creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies .
The program isn &apos;t afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment .
Not that the language war is won , even on &quot; Batibot . &quot;
During one recent episode , all the advertisements were in English .
Latin American countries have long urged Canada to join the OAS in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the U.S. , which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization .
Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership , it hasn &apos;t been a Washington priority .
The Canadian application is expected to be announced in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy .
&quot; Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , &quot; Mr. Mulroney said recently .
Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada &apos;s joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization .
Canada , at times , could be an awkward OAS partner for the U.S. if its United Nations voting record is an indication .
In U.N. General Assembly votes last year , Canada voted the same as the U.S. only 63 % of the time .
France voted the same as the U.S. 76 % of the time , West Germany 79 % and Britain 83 % .
&quot; Latin Americans see Canada as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty , &quot; he said .
The OAS , which tries to promote peace and economic development within the Americas , is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis .
Cuba has been suspended from OAS membership , but the organization &apos;s members are discussing Cuba &apos;s reinstatement .
Early this century , diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach .
Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones .
It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu .
Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes , searching for that unusual glint .
But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd . , the world &apos;s diamond kingpins , do their work .
Oh yes , the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards .
&quot; If there &apos;s diamonds out there , we &apos;ll get to them , &quot; says Les Johns , De Beers &apos;s engineering manager .
Here , wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world &apos;s most inhospitable diamond dig , lies the earth &apos;s most precious jewel box .
While other mines might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use .
Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been turned into one .
Today , no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers &apos;s stingy approval .
The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa .
Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes , proving diamonds aren &apos;t forever .
Oranjemund , the mine headquarters , is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents .
Jackals roam the streets at night , and gemsbok , hardy antelope with long straight horns , wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers .
On most days , the desert &apos;s heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag .
The wind , stinging with sand , never seems to stop .
Still , miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers &apos;s head offices in South Africa and London keep coming .
And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds .
There are six video rental shops , three restaurants , one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling .
The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world .
&quot; Nothing is too good for our golf course , &quot; says Tony George , a mining engineer .
Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes .
Then there is the artificial sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , jutting into the ocean .
Made of sand , it receives around-the-clock maintenance against the battering waves .
When the mining in front of the wall is complete , it is moved northward .
A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard .
Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood .
Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that , inexplicably , held against the waves .
&quot; The Caterpillar people aren &apos;t too happy when they see their equipment used like that , &quot; shrugs Mr. George .
&quot; They figure it &apos;s not a very good advert . &quot;
Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds .
But should they spy one , the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value .
For these workers at the bottom of the mine &apos;s pay scale , this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail .
Still , employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two .
One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie .
Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe .
A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail .
None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security .
Outside the white-walled headquarters of the so-called Society of Orange Workers , all seems normal in South Africa &apos;s abnormal society .
A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back .
Over at Conradies , the general store , a black stock boy scurries to help an elderly white woman with her packages .
Down the street , a car pulls into the Shell station and is surrounded by black attendants .
A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes .
White women serve tea and coffee , and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards .
White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows .
There isn &apos;t a black worker in sight .
Not in the kitchen , or the storeroom or the book shop .
They do indeed want their own nation .
But here in Morgenzon , a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal , the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady .
Here , then , is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid &apos;s last stand .
Their idea is to create a city , first , and then an entire nation -- without blacks .
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa .
And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe .
Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland .
The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice .
Thus , farmer Johan Fischer , his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease , crawls around under his planter , tightening bolts and fixing dents .
On almost every other farm in South Africa , black workers do the repairs .
But not here .
Mr. Fischer plows his own fields , sows his own corn and sunflowers , and feeds his own sheep .
Over at the fiberglass factory , four white workers assemble water tanks on their own , and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road .
On Main Street , Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop , then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family .
Down by the stream , a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course .
If whites want to play there by themselves , says consulting engineer Willem van Heerden , whites should also build it by themselves .
&quot; If we want to survive as a people , &quot; he says , &quot; we have to change our way of life .
The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others . &quot;
Somewhere , the son sighs , things went terribly wrong with apartheid ; today , whites even rely on blacks to police their separation .
&quot; People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it .
But my father meant it to mean real separation , &quot; says the son .
The Orange Workers speak sincerely .
&quot; We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong , &quot; says Pieter Bruwer , the Orange Workers &apos; chief scribe and pamphleteer .
&quot; We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly . &quot;
Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom .
According to Mr. Verwoerd , the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal , even before the blacks .
Today , Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads .
Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks , and many houses and storefronts are empty .
There are few factories and no mines .
It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation , unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa .
So far , about 150 Orange Workers have moved here , spending nearly $ 1 million buying up property over the past three years .
Still , complete and total segregation remains elusive .
Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area .
Despite the Orange Workers &apos; intention to put them all out of work , they are in no hurry to leave .
The 650-or-so local whites who aren &apos;t Orange Workers are more troubled .
Try as they might , they just can &apos;t conceive of life without black workers .
&quot; Impossible , impossible , &quot; say the Conradies , an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades .
&quot; We can &apos;t do without their help , &quot; says Mrs. Conradie .
&quot; Oh no .
We need them and I thank God for them . &quot;
Over at the Shell station , owner Rudi van Dyk , who doubles as Morgenzon &apos;s mayor , worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation .
&quot; What they want us to do just isn &apos;t practical , &quot; he says , noting that he employs 16 blacks .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t afford to hire 16 whites .
The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary wouldn &apos;t know how to handle money . &quot;
Back at the Verwoerd house , Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr .
The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics , Morgenzon will boom .
&quot; We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation , &quot; says Mr. Verwoerd .
&quot; By populating a place now , we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account . &quot;
Curiously , he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC , which his father outlawed in 1960 .
&quot; The ANC won &apos;t be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations , &quot; says Mr. Verwoerd .
&quot; Likewise , no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners . &quot;
He apologizes for sounding pushy .
&quot; Look , &quot; he says , &quot; If the rest of South Africa wants to have an integrated melting pot , that &apos;s their choice .
We &apos;ll leave them alone .
We just want to have our own cup of tea . &quot;
And they will even serve it themselves .
They were the signature of his adversary , Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega .
The rebel officer &apos;s slow and painful death , at the headquarters of Panama &apos;s Battalion-2000 squad , was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega , says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports .
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night , sometimes more than once a night .
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress , Vicky Amado , and her mother , Norma .
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters .
More enemies to be dealt with .
In the two weeks since the rebellion , which the U.S. hesitantly backed , Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal-and efficient-in maintaining power .
America &apos;s war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship .
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama &apos;s long history of conspirators and pirates .
For most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience .
The woman had nearly died .
But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away .
Mr. Noriega &apos;s tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests .
From that point on , the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian &apos;s misadventures .
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them .
And out of necessity : the U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life .
&quot; The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along , &quot; says Ambler Moss , a former Ambassador to Panama .
&quot; He has mastered the art of survival . &quot;
In keeping with America &apos;s long history of propping up Mr. Noriega , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival .
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama &apos;s dire economic situation , says Mr. Moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement .
&quot; If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through 1988 , &quot; Mr. Moss contends .
Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega &apos;s allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne .
&quot; He is cornered , &quot; says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega .
&quot; The Americans have left him without a way out .
It is easy to fight when you don &apos;t have any other option . &quot;
His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses .
The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959 , when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima , according to former U.S. intelligence officials .
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega &apos;s half-brother , a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado .
A spy was born .
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega , who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face .
Born the illegitimate son of his father &apos;s maid , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City .
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate .
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , French-made uniform , Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life , friends from the period say .
Mr. Noriega &apos;s relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials say .
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison , Major Omar Torrijos , gave him an intriguing assignment : Mr. Noriega would organize the province &apos;s first intelligence service .
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama &apos;s national income .
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader .
Mr. Noriega &apos;s initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says .
It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly .
&quot; He did it very well , &quot; recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation .
&quot; He started building the files that helped him gain power . &quot;
A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy .
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses .
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy .
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles , which was ruled by United Fruit Co .
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control .
&quot; It was like a play on Broadway , &quot; recalls Mr. Martinez .
&quot; Noriega managed the whole thing .
He was superb .
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . &quot;
During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious .
Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices .
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office .
&quot; People started wondering if something was wrong with him , &quot; Mr. Miranda recalls .
But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned , Mr. Noriega was a model recruit .
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely .
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama &apos;s so-called G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier .
He became Gen. Torrijos &apos;s inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama &apos;s secrets .
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega &apos;s moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans .
&quot; Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . &quot;
Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns .
During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 &apos;s connections to arrested drug traffickers .
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .
The head of the DEA at the time , John Ingersoll , scotched the assassination plan .
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials , including Mr. Noriega .
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S.
&quot; Everybody was afraid of him , &quot; Mr. Ingersoll says .
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos &apos;s own phone , according to American intelligence officials .
&quot; We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , &quot; says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner .
For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. Turner says .
&quot; In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters .
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you . &quot;
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others .
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration .
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern : gun-running .
They included one of Mr. Noriega &apos;s closest friends and business partners , Carlos Wittgreen .
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself .
At the time , though , in 1979 , the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy .
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon .
Dade County and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through Miami , made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil .
It was a Friday in June .
The Pentagon foiled the plan .
According to military officers at the time , word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting .
On Monday , U.S. officials received a routine , unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama .
&quot; Due to health reasons , Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington , &quot; it read .
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback .
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen , the friend of Mr. Noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality .
But now , along with re-indicting Mr. Noriega &apos;s pal , they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ 2 million in arms .
In January 1980 , Jerome Sanford , as assistant U.S. attorney , was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in Miami .
Panamanian dictator Torrijos , he was told , had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington .
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega &apos;s friend , Mr. Wittgreen , would be handling the shah &apos;s security .
It wouldn &apos;t be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. Noriega , the prosecutor was told .
After prodding from Mr. Sanford , U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed .
The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death .
&quot; I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we wouldn &apos;t have the problems we have now , &quot; Mr. Sanford says .
&quot; If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . &quot;
In August 1983 , Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama , having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos .
Soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses .
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega &apos;s G-2 back on the U.S. payroll .
Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA .
Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively .
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas .
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama .
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua .
And on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua .
&quot; Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin , &quot; he says .
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials .
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs , the U.S. ambassador to Panama , of the invitation .
&quot; Briggs screamed , &quot; Mr. Windsor recalls .
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a &quot; honey trap , &quot; in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event &quot; with sound and video . &quot;
Mr. Briggs , on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council , couldn &apos;t be reached for comment .
As Mr. Noriega &apos;s political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the Contras , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington .
For instance , he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party .
But just one month later , he also contributed $ 100,000 to a Contra leader , according to documents released for Oliver North &apos;s criminal trial in Washington , D.C.
Yet , his political setbacks mounted .
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta , a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S. , after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder .
And , all the while , Panama &apos;s debt problems continued to grow .
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate .
In late 1986 , he made an offer he thought the U.S. couldn &apos;t refuse .
&quot; North , &quot; the document went on , referring to Oliver North , &quot; has told Noriega &apos;s representative that U.S. law forbade such actions .
Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams , who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz .
Mr. Noriega &apos;s proposal was turned down .
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image .
The end of the marriage was at hand .
Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega &apos;s insurance policy .
The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence .
Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him .
Lawyers in Miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988 .
Now , neither side -- the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega -- has an easy out .
President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice .
Mr. Noriega believes he hasn &apos;t any alternative but to continue clutching to power .
It is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death .
In the end , is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein &apos;s monster , created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power ?
Not quite , Sen. Leahy contends .
&quot; For short-term gains , people were willing to put up with him .
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger , &quot; he says .
&quot; I don &apos;t think we created him as much as we fed him , nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong . &quot;
The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants ; their herds are thriving .
But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better .
At this week &apos;s U.N. conference in Lausanne , they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies .
A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would &quot; guarantee the extinction of the elephant . &quot;
Legitimate ranchers , who have an interest in preserving the herds , would go out of business .
Poachers would control the underground trade .
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise , but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down .
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play , not a negotiation .
Fortunately , the nations of southern Africa haven &apos;t totally surrendered their sovereignty .
Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the &quot; made in Switzerland &quot; solution .
In fact , they seemed a mite resentful .
That &apos;s not fair ; they &apos;re not all fat .
According to people who attended , he didn &apos;t advocate an end to glasnost , his policy of openness .
But he made clear that the press should show greater responsibility in its reporting and cut back on criticism of his reforms .
The text of his remarks hasn &apos;t been published , and editors say they have no instructions as to whether it will be .
Accounts of previous such meetings with media and other groups have been printed , sometimes after a delay of several days .
He singled out the daily Izvestia and the weekly Argumenty i Fakty , and also gave stinging criticism of Yuri Afanasyev , a leading reformist historian who has written articles attacking the Communist Party .
Among other things , Mr. Gorbachev questioned whether Mr. Afanasyev should remain in the party .
The meeting lasted a little under two hours and was attended by most members of the ruling Politburo .
There was no other speaker apart from the Soviet leader , and those attacked weren &apos;t given the opportunity to defend themselves .
Mr. Afanasyev , who isn &apos;t an editor , didn &apos;t attend .
The piece was based on a survey of 1,500 readers &apos; letters and contained some criticism of Mr. Gorbachev himself .
The newspaper wrote that readers assessed his role both positively and negatively .
It said many thanked the Soviet leader for his &quot; self-control , modesty , culture and ability to hear a speaker out . &quot;
All this , the paper quoted readers as saying , &quot; has seriously weakened his authority . &quot;
The Soviet leader apparently suggested to Argumenty i Fakty &apos;s editor , Vyacheslav Starkov , that he should resign .
The comment , which Mr. Starkov relayed to his staff , has sparked anger and bitterness at the paper .
Mr. Starkov has been summoned to see the Kremlin &apos;s ideology chief , Vadim Medvedev , in the near future , and may discover then if he is to be fired .
Izvestia was criticized for a front-page article last Wednesday that took a sharp look at the Parliament &apos;s activities .
It attacked the level of a debate on the private-sector cooperative movement , saying &quot; the discussion was more like a riot than a civilized exchange of points of view . &quot;
And it questioned the speed with which the Parliament was adopting new legislation , often with a minimum of debate .
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday .
After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services &apos; van just as the sun was coming up .
At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country .
&quot; I am happy to see the spirit of the people , &quot; said Mr. Sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit .
As the crowd outside his home shouted &quot; ANC , ANC , &quot; the old man shot his fists into the air .
&quot; I &apos;m inspired by the mood of the people . &quot;
Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .
&quot; The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , &quot; said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu .
&quot; Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .
There &apos;s no turning back . &quot;
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC &apos;s leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .
Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others &quot; is only a half-measure . &quot;
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency .
If it doesn &apos;t yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday &apos;s releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest .
If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .
Pretoria hasn &apos;t forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
In order to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible .
Says Peter Mokaba , president of the South African Youth Congress : &quot; We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . &quot;
They never considered themselves to be anything else .
At last night &apos;s rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .
&quot; We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , &quot; said Andrew Mlangeni , another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63 .
&quot; We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we aren &apos;t disciplined we may not see them here with us . &quot;
We don &apos;t know who is winning the drug war in Latin America , but we know who &apos;s losing it -- the press .
Over the past 12 years , at least 40 journalists have died there .
The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August , trying to prevent their takeover of the country .
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity , the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador , Colombia &apos;s second-largest newspaper .
The paper &apos;s local administrator , Maria Luz Lopez , was shot dead , and her mother wounded , while her car was stopped for a red light .
An hour later , the paper &apos;s circulation manager , Miguel Soler , was shot and killed near his home .
The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper &apos;s offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin .
They bombed the Bogota offices last month , destroying its computer and causing $ 2.5 million in damage .
El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff .
They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war . &quot;
This comes from a man whose brother , Guillermo , was murdered in 1986 .
The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions , but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today &apos;s editions .
Many will use a common editorial .
The report charged that Panama &apos;s Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before .
&quot; Noriega has closed every independent newspaper , radio and television station and arrested , tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters , &quot; the statement declared .
It added : &quot; In Cuba , public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere , repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever . &quot;
And in Nicaragua , promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas &quot; have not materialized . &quot;
As it happens , the four countries cited , Colombia , Cuba , Panama and Nicaragua , are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics .
Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent .
Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges ; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua .
In Colombia , the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19 , which Castro has clearly backed .
The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing .
This week , the government arrested Jose Abello Silva , said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader .
He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived .
Later , another high-ranking trafficker , Leonidas Vargas , was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized .
Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid .
President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco , President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem .
It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner , rather than later .
After the Panama fiasco , they will need some reassurance .
Certainly , the Colombian press is much in need of that .
Is her cell phone not working ?
Did he leave already ?
Is he still there ?
Cool .
That would be amazing .
Can you believe it ?
You &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
I &apos;m here .
I have to go .
I don &apos;t have any vacation days .
Give me a minute .
Would you pick me up something from the store ? There &apos;s some great deals there this week .
What do you think of him ?
Did you let the dog out ?
Right .
I had to pick something up there .
I really want to go there .
That &apos;s not so bad .
Are you serious ?
You &apos;re joking .
Is there a problem ?
Why didn &apos;t you just call me ?
I have to do laundry .
I hate her .
I overslept .
It &apos;s not that big a deal .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
What are you talking about ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Get it ?
How unpleasant .
That &apos;s so unnecessary .
That &apos;s unfortunate .
Do you think she knows ?
Where are you now ?
I &apos;m at the library .
Hold on .
Did you hear that ?
Give me a call .
He lost his cell phone on a bus .
Are you busy ?
What are you doing this weekend ?
What did you do last weekend ?
Let &apos;s watch a movie .
Let &apos;s get some ice cream !
My fridge is empty .
I need to clean my room .
That sounds like a lot of fun .
I &apos;m bored .
How much time do we have left ?
She doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .
I had the weirdest dream last night .
I have to call my mom .
Did you call your mom ?
Where did you go ?
Don &apos;t leave me !
I want a pet .
That &apos;s so cute .
I can &apos;t stand it !
He never called .
That &apos;s fine , no worries .
Go to bed .
Why are you still awake ?
Have a seat .
You dropped something .
Could you repeat that ?
Take some medicine .
I don &apos;t believe you .
Excuse me , could you tell me where the restroom is ?
I guess so .
I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
You &apos;re going to regret it .
Did you pay ?
I &apos;m broke .
Can I ask you a favor ?
Not really , no .
It &apos;s just a scratch .
Did you check under your bed ?
I met his wife .
Don &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s so hot outside .
Turn off the lights .
That &apos;s so unfair .
I don &apos;t understand .
Stop it .
I &apos;m waiting for a friend .
Is it an emergency ?
Don &apos;t get lost !
I &apos;ve never seen this episode .
Can I talk to you for a second ?
What classes are you taking ?
Could you spell that please ?
Did you tell anyone about this ?
That &apos;s too much trouble .
That &apos;s terrifying .
I take the subway .
Watch your step .
I can hear you from down the hall .
Do you need help ?
Let me know what you come up with .
We &apos;re not going to be back on time .
I &apos;ll let her know .
They spend too much time together .
She &apos;s in a meeting .
When is he leaving ?
What happened to the wall ?
What are you going to tell her ?
It &apos;s pretty decent .
I &apos;m good , thanks .
Figure it out .
Sorry , can &apos;t help you there .
She said you weren &apos;t here .
What are your plans ?
Let &apos;s split a cab .
Everything worked out fine .
She went home for the weekend .
Time to go to work !
Can I have some water ?
Can I get some chopsticks , please ? Use mine .
I need to buy groceries .
Did you get my voicemail ?
I sent you a text message .
Is it too late to sign up ?
What &apos;s the next major holiday ?
I have an appointment .
Cross the street .
I have to go to court .
Can you please wake me up ?
Sorry to bother you .
What time is it ?
Don &apos;t sit there .
That &apos;s pretty good .
Have fun !
See you later .
It shouldn &apos;t take too long .
It &apos;s hard to explain .
Talk to your professor .
I can &apos;t remember what she looks like .
I haven &apos;t eaten fish in so long .
Don &apos;t overdo it .
That would be awesome .
I have bad news .
Who do you work for ?
Where &apos;s your class ?
I &apos;ll take care of it .
He &apos;s out of town .
Her phone is disconnected .
I &apos;ll call you right back .
I &apos;ll be with you in just a second .
Turn around .
Why would you do such a thing ?
That &apos;s terrible .
I need to check something .
It &apos;s cold in here .
Why is everyone so quiet ? Who knows ?
I didn &apos;t learn much .
We should do this again .
They can &apos;t hear you .
Look at that !
We &apos;ll just leave it at that .
I kept getting a busy signal .
We seem to have a bad connection on this phone .
Would you like to leave a message ?
Is that OK ?
What are we going to eat for dinner ?
Now what should we eat ?
Weren &apos;t you just complaining that it &apos;s too expensive to eat out ?
Yes , I did .
They were so good .
Huh , I didn &apos;t know that .
How do you want the beef ?
Iced tea , please .
How do you want your eggs ? What are my choices ?
That sounds like a good idea .
What time will you be arriving ?
Thanks for lunch .
Next time lunch is on me .
I &apos;m serious .
Next time you &apos;ll treat .
What happened just now , Mark ?
I just don &apos;t like him at all .
You want my advice ?
Hey , you look concerned .
What &apos;s on your mind ?
The final exam .
Well , don &apos;t worry too much .
She &apos;s really pretty , isn &apos;t she ? Don &apos;t you think so ? Yeah , right !
I cut myself when I shaved this morning .
I know how you feel .
Any advice ?
Hm , sounds like a good idea .
I heard you &apos;re moving to New York .
Oh , that &apos;s great !
But I &apos;m going to miss you .
Me , too .
Let &apos;s keep in touch .
Trust me .
I won &apos;t .
I &apos;ll keep you posted .
You have my address ?
Well , I have your e-mail address .
So , how is your new roommate ?
But how many times did you try ? At least three times .
I guess I &apos;m going to complain to the manager .
That &apos;s nice !
Well , actually I haven &apos;t heard from him in ages .
Would you like to have some ice-cream ?
I wish I could , but I just can &apos;t .
I &apos;d better not .
The problem is that the window unit is not powerful enough .
I guess not , huh .
I &apos;m going to move out anyway .
So how can you stand the heat ?
It helps a little .
Fine , I &apos;ll be up in a few minutes .
Let me take a look .
No wonder the water won &apos;t go down .
But what should I do now ?
I know .
I wish I could , but I &apos;ve got to go now .
I have an appointment in twenty minutes .
Well , if you need anything , just let me know .
Oh , by the way , can you give me a ride ?
My car is still in the shop .
You sure are having bad luck these days .
I wonder if he &apos;s paying more for rent now .
I don &apos;t have the faintest idea .
You &apos;re right !
I &apos;m calling about the apartment you advertised .
When do you need it ?
Sometime around next week .
What can you tell me about this apartment ?
The monthly rent is $ 650 , with a $ 300 security deposit .
And ... that &apos;s probably it .
May I come over tomorrow to take a look ?
How about 10 AM ?
May I have your name , please ?
I &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
Your room is like an ice-box ! No , it &apos;s not ! It &apos;s just comfortable .
Just look at me !
I think you &apos;re exaggerating ! No , I &apos;m not .
Where &apos;s the thermostat ?
I &apos;ve got a pretty tight schedule today !
Let &apos;s call it a day , shall we ?
We could do it first thing tomorrow morning .
I &apos;ll just grab something to eat .
I &apos;m tied up for the moment .
Something might have come up .
I couldn &apos;t help it .
That &apos;s how rumors get started .
I don &apos;t know how to break it to you .
I hope there &apos;s nothing serious . Things do happen . Everything will work out just fine !
Let &apos;s keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best !
